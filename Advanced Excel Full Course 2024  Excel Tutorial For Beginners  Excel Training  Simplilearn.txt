Joffrey Mur says and I quote without
data you're blind and deaf right in the
middle of freeway sounds intense right
so is the potential of data these days
every ad you watch on your mobile
devices every stock you invest in every
recommendation you get on your next
travel plan is made by going through
your past data the data trials you left
behind while making on online booking
browsing or your activity on social
media hence your suggestion is decided
by data crunching tools and AI to assist
you makeup better call this procedure is
called the datadriven decision making
today the IT industry has a great demand
for professionals with skills to handle
and analyze data to carry out data
driven decision making one of the most
important of all the skills is Microsoft
Excel today we from Simply learn bring
you this full course on Microsoft Excel
we have curated this full course in
collaboration with realtime industry
experts and organize the syllabus to
help you get the right skills to match
the current industry standards we will
start with a brief production on the
Microsoft Excel proceeding ahead we'll
walk you through the basics of Microsoft
Excel where we'll cover spreadsheet
fundamentals data sorting and filtering
data validation conditional formatting
and other preliminary technicalities
around Excel up next we'll walk you to
the basic inbuilt functions that will
assist you to carry the day-to-day
operations on data and then we'll dive
into the advanced Excel Concepts that
will cover Excel VBA and macros data
analysis and data visualization this Tut
tutorial will also include time series
analysis some of the top trending data
analysis projects using Microsoft Excel
to help you build a strong portfolio of
data analysis and then we'll also cover
most frequently Asked data and business
analyst interview questions based on
Microsoft Excel so without any further
Ado let's get
started what is Microsoft Excel so
Microsoft Excel is a software product
designed and developed by Microsoft
storing data in an organized way that is
rows and columns and Microsoft Excel is
also capable to manipulate data through
some mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel so
following are some fundamentals that you
need to know before getting started with
Microsoft Excel so basically when you
install the Microsoft Office in your
computer you will have various Microsoft
products out of which Microsoft Exel is
one of the product so we will be dealing
exactly with that particular product
that is Microsoft Excel so when you get
started with Microsoft Excel this is
what you will see in the first page so
this particular page is called as
Microsoft Excel homepage where where you
will be having various varieties of
sheets Microsoft Excel will give you
some suggestions based on the type of
sheet you want to work with we will see
this in a better way through the
Practical session so once you get
started with the sheet you will have
some more options so this particular
option is called as the toolbar menu you
will have the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so these are the tools that you
will be using to work on your data using
Microsoft Excel furthermore we have a
toolbar ribbon so when you select some
of the other option from the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help buttons you will
have a ribbon so for example you can see
that I have selected the Home Tool here
so when I press on the Home Tool this is
the ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives
me so this ribbon has some options in it
which can perform various operations now
in a further more detailed way we will
have toolbar groups so when you see in
the previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the font bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions so
each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialog box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of op options which are not able to
be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the rule
name and apart from that you can have
have the sheet tracker in the bottom
left corner of the Excel sheet where you
can navigate through different sheets
and in the bottom right corner you have
an option of increasing or decreasing
the sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
now we enter the demo inventory in
Microsoft Excel so we will be using
Microsoft Excel to create a sheet of the
employees in a company so basically an
employee in a company has employee ID
name and designation salary etc etc so
we will be trying to create the same
table using Microsoft Excel but before
that let us understand the fundamentals
of Microsoft Excel through the Practical
demo first so I have started my
Microsoft Excel and this is how the
homepage of Microsoft Excel looks like
so so you have a blank workbook over
here if you want to create a new
workbook you can select new Option so
Excel will provide you with various
variety of sheets you can see money in
Excel adjustable meeting agenda
streaming shoulders small business cash
flow and many more if you're not able to
find what you're looking for then you
always have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal if
it's planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calendar
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
construction proposal en your name it
Excel has got it so Excel will provide
you with some some variety of options
based on your requirement now for this
session let's get started with your
plank workbook which looks something
like this since this tutorial is based
on the fundamentals we'll go with the
blank workbook now over here you can see
the toolbar that we discussed earlier
that has the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar I have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some
effects to the text font size and font
style etc etc apart from this we have
also discussed about the cells in every
sheet so this particular cell has an
address so you can see the address over
here which is B3 so B happens to be the
column name and three happens to be the
row name now we also had a discussion
about the sheet tracker right now we
just have one sheet if you want multiple
sheets you can just feel free to select
on the plus option which will always
create you some extra sheets and you can
navigate through sheets just by pressing
on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employ details in a
company now let's select this particular
cell and let's type in employ
details yeah we have the cell now an
employee details table will have the
information related to employees so the
information will be about name it will
be about employee
number it will be the designation
and maybe
salary and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the designation the
name uh the the name of the designation
is practically good but it is not
visible so when you uh when you're not
on that particular cell you can see that
the name is incomplete over here so you
can always fix that you can just you
know manually change the size of the row
or cell or you can also feel free to you
know double click on that cell which
will automatically you know set the size
of that particular cell and same goes to
the blood group just let's try to double
click on that and same goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help you with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employees uh let's add the names
Joe
John uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
Mike let's type in Tim
Jeff
Jeffrey yeah we have a couple of
employees now let's type in the employee
numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
let's type in the designation okay let's
choose U Joe to be the CEO of the
company and John and as the software
developer and Mary as
tester Mark and
finance Susan also in
finance and Jennifer in testing
and mic in uh
marketing same goes for
Tim and again Jeffrey into software
development
and
uh morg into testing
again now let's click on C so that it
gets you know resized according to the
length of the text now it's done so
let's get into
salary uh
$10,000 and
$115,000 and
$119,000 let's increase the salary of a
CEO so let's keep it $1
lakh and finance again
20,000 so yeah let salaries are
allocated again the blood group
yeah we have the blood groups now let's
type in the mobile numbers
[Music]
yeah now we have Ted in some random
mobile numbers as well so uh yeah this
is how you can add in some data into
your table and now let us imagine that
you forgot to add or remove a column so
let's imagine that we wanted to add a
serial number as well but somehow we
forgot to add it now you can always add
a new row or column for example here we
wanted to add a new column so we just
have to right click on a select the
insert option here we have a new row now
now let's type in serial
number and let's type
one now can you see the small box option
over here if you just drag it you can
you know copy paste all those over here
and now let's right
click and fill series now we have the
employee number starting from 1 to 10
that's how you do it and apart from this
you you can also uh you know change the
font of the entire row you can change
the font to say uh aroni and you can
always also change the font and same
goes to the employee table you can
select it bold it and you can also
increase the size and again select a
color for the text maybe a different
color green would be
better and uh you can also select the
entire cells and align them to the
center looks more good and and you can
select or double click the row names so
you'll have the proper spacing between
all the rows and columns so we have
double click on the column right yeah so
basically that's how you make things
happen now let's save this so I'd like
to go to the save option and uh EMP
data let me save this in my local
location and just save it's done
so that's how you work on your Excel
file with some basic data and to learn
more don't forget to get subscribed to
Simply learns YouTube channel and don't
forget to hit that Bell icon to stay
updated so you are the first person to
get an update on any technology not just
Excel now let's get back to the
Practical mode and now we are on our
Excel spreadsheet so here we have some
text boxes on the column A and on column
B we have lower and upper Okay so um we
have a mix of uh uppercase and lower
case in our text so first we'll try to
convert them to lower case and then
we'll try to convert the entire text
into uppercase so for that you need to
press on equal symbol and select the
lower formula tap and you selected the
function and now click on the cell A3
that's your cell address and press on
okay now all the letters are converted
to low case so we had J in the uppercase
which is converted to low case now all
you can do is drag the formula to all
the cells and it will be applied to all
the cells right now let's similarly try
to convert into uppercase and tab space
and there you go you have selected the
formula now the cell
address press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and there you go all the cells
are converted to uppercase now that's
how you convert the cells or data in
Excel to uppercase or lowercase in Excel
now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet now here we have some sales
data based on a store now what we going
to do is we going to add some multiple
rows or a single Row in this particular
data so here you can see the region wise
category Wise statewise subcategory Wise
and the sales and quantities right now
let us imagine that you must have to add
a sale data here right so let us imagine
that on the row 7eventh you were
supposed to add some detail for example
some technology related sale happened on
that day and you missed out to add it
right so how do you create a new rule
now so for example if multiple sales
happened on the same day like 3 to four
and you missed out them so how do I add
three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option option insert
now this will insert one single row if
you wanted to add one single uh row or
you know tle and if you wanted to add
multiple rows for example you wanted to
add three rows Al together then it's
also simple all you have to do is select
three
rows and right click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go so that's how you add multiple
rows in a Excel spreadsheet or that's
how you add one single Row in an Excel
spreadsheet now we have started our
Excel worksheet and here you can see we
have employe details on our worksheet
now all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you are a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are timec consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so B is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a column next to V then
you want to select the column C and
right click and select the insert
options so that it can be added in
between B and C which is adjacent to B
so let's look at it right so you have
added the next uh column or a new column
right next to the column V and it's in
between the designation and employee
name now you can add your you know
second name so that's how you create a
new column in Excel now in case if you
wanted to you know create multiple
columns Al together so uh here here we
have or here we needed a second name
also here you have a designation and you
wanted to add another column which you
know assigns managers to the employees
right so let's delete it uh Delete the
second column and let me explain you how
what I want to do so here you wanted to
add the second name of the employee and
also the manager of these employees
right so here you wanted to add two
columns Al together right uh and now you
might be wondering could I add two
columns together or will it work only
for the one column thing right no it
works for two columns and also more than
two columns all together so you wanted
to add two columns here right so select
the two columns you you can select or
you can click on the column see and hold
that left key and drag it along the
right side okay so here I've selected
two columns and here it's three right so
you can see here uh it's 1 04 48 5 6 7 6
are cross 3C that means you have
selected three columns if I navigate on
the four you can see we have selected
four columns right now right click and
select on insert and you'll have four
columns in between employee name and
designation now you might have to add
your second name manager name managers
employee ID you know and the department
everything or you can add anything or
any number of columns in between the
existing columns now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet now you might want to you
know add uh some extension to your data
since we have sales here you might want
to add the dollar logo right so if you
have like five to 10 rows then it's easy
but if you have multiple rows then it
might be a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again there is another way where you can
just you know uh click on the first
table header and press control spacebar
so the combination key is control
spacebar for columns and if you want to
select the entire row it is shift space
bar so this is the method two and
another method so you might have a doubt
here right so when you click on the
column name or when you click on the row
number the entire row or entire column
gets selected right and you wanted to
select only the cells which have data so
we have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well control
shift right arrow key or left Arrow key
based on your rows and all the rows with
data will be selected I mean all the
sales in a row are selected not the
entire row and U coming back to the
first question that is adding the dollar
symbol so here we have General so go to
the data type and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell right I'll show you now let us
add the number 100 and press enter
there you go let us add another number
like th000 and press enter so the data
formatting is automatically applied to
all the cells so most of the time your
cells or the data sheet will be varying
you might have to add or remove elements
or numbers right so in such scenarios
this will be helpful now comparing two
different columns or multiple columns
happens to be an important job when you
working in data analytics as you have to
come up with some decisive decisions
based on the data now if if you had to
do it manually then you might end up
taking hours or even days based on the
data set you're working with but if I
say that you can do it within minutes
then it would be interesting to work
with right now we'll be doing the same
now we'll work on a sample data set
right on my screen so here we have
column 1 and column two now our job is
to compare the column 1 and column two
and come up with the result now the
first and the simplest way to do it is
use the built-in conditional formatting
which comes with Excel by default now
all you have to do is select all the
data and navigate to home and in the
home go to Styles group and select
conditional formatting and in
conditional formatting you can see
highlight cells so in that you can use
duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate it
means you're comparing the cells and you
can see there are some duplicate cells
which are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column 1 but not in column 2 so you can
just press unique and there you go you
can find it now you can also try to you
know change the color by filling with
green for The Unique columns and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
next cell press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make some minute
modifications to this so uh if in case
you find the data then you can say not
found so for that uh you can try if and
inside brackets and then you can give
the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found there you go close the bracket
press enter and there you go if there is
a perfect match you will have found and
if there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare two columns in Excel so uh
another way is using the lookup
functions so we use a simple vooka
function to compare both the cells so
for that let's type in equals to we look
up space and um select the cell you want
to check for and then the range of
elements you want to uh compare and then
I'll press F4 to log
them now uh you want the data from
column
one and now you want the exact match so
zero press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column 1
and column 2 are been displayed here so
but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this can be
fixed we can make some minor tweaks to
the same
formula so uh we can add if
error
comma simply write an as not found
and close the bracket so that should do
so we have closed the bracket and press
enter there you go now simply drag this
and soon you can see the data which is
having no match is shown as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this
one yeah now we have the clear column
for so here you can see we have Ford
India and here you can see we have just
Ford and similarly here you have
Mahendra and Mahendra and here you have
Mahendra right so in some situations you
might have to compare two different
columns but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first cases Oracle and then the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one and the same but you have
some minor text changes right just like
here you have Ford India and here you
have Ford so what if you had such kind
of issues so you can also make some
minor tweaks to it so using the same
lookup formula you can add equals to we
lookup
and also the comparision cell which is
this one and you're not you're not
stopping there you're trying to add the
wild card here so the wild card is HRI
which means if there is anything like uh
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that that's what we
going to do so after entering entering
the wild card symbol you'll select the
range of columns which you have to uh
you know fetch the data from and then
try to fix them using function key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and
enter now let's try to drag
it there you go so you have the data my
Mahindra and Mahindra hindai India Honda
India so that's how you try to use uh
comparing cells in Excel now you can see
I'm on my Excel worksheet and I have one
table on my worksheet right now so you
can you know transposing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way select
all the sales that you have on your
sheet and and press on contrl C so it
will give you the copy option and then
you can also paste in the same sheet or
if you want you can go to a whole new
sheet and select the paste option over
here but before selecting the actual
paste option you can see a small drop-
down icon click on that and navigate to
paste special and in this you can see
transpose option click on that or you
know make sure that it's checked and
press okay now you can see all your
columns are been converted into rows and
all your rows are converted into columns
so this was the first way and uh what is
the second way you ask me so it's really
simple select one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose and select the array which you
want to transpose so this this is the
array so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data press
enter there you go so all your rows are
now columns and all your columns are now
the rows now on my spreadsheet you can
see some data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is North West Southeast so
you can you know make things look better
by hiding these columns and if you hide
the these columns it's critical for the
end user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select the columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the rows of
North and Rose of
West then you have the rose of
South and rows of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
do is just click on the minimize button
and those will be minimized simp
similarly the rules right and to unhide
them all you can do is click on the plus
icon and they will be
unhidden you can also try to ungroup the
columns and rows all you have to do is
select the columns and click on the
ungroup option similarly the rows as
well and that's how you can group and
ungroup rows and columns in now we are
on our spreadsheet and you can see I
have some sample data on my spreadsheet
and it does have some blank rows now how
do I eliminate these blank rows so one
step is you can you know select the
entire row and try to right click and
delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key and you will have an option of
deleting the Cs now select the entire
row now now we are selecting the entire
rows with blank data and press okay and
the cells will be shifted now this was
simple but let me show you another
example so even here we have some blank
rows but in between those blank rows for
example will take cell 17 or cell d17 or
row 17 we have some data testing and
here in the employee ID we have some
data in
a26 and again in B3 and we have some
data that is first
name right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a let tab
and the cells will be from A2 to
G2 press enter now you have seven so now
we are basically calculating the number
of cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which which
are basically the empty columns right
now let's do some formatting if you
need let's try to add
filters crl a control D and now table
will have filters and
headers now here you can see the drop
down icon click on that now instead of
select all what you can do is Select
zero now you will be highlighted with
all the rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is the same way control
minus there you go
now clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
retrained and all the data or all the
cells or all the rows which do not have
any data which are completely blank they
have been eliminated so here you can see
columns and rows so especially the
fourth row and the column C right so uh
currently we have data on our uh
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you'll have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if uh
even even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when when you
scroll this and keep that data uh set on
the column as it is right so we can also
do that let's look at both of them so
there is a simple process to do that all
you have to do is select the cell uh for
which you want to uh you know set the or
freeze the column adjacent to it or the
row adjacent to it right so currently
want to let me expand it so currently I
want to freeze this particular row right
and this particular column so the cell I
would be selecting is the first cell
here that is
D5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to navigate to
the toolbar and then select the view
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of free panes right
so click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is the second option
or you can freeze the entire column that
is the third option or you can freeze
both that is the first option right
freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully Frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel now here on my
sheet you can see we have some numbers
that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $ 53.1 to $12 and $110 now
the task is to convert these numbers
into word format that is representing
the numbers alphabetically right this
might be a little curious and we also
might end up searching for a predefined
method which is not readily available in
Excel but there is a way where you can
create a function using Excel VBA or
macros now again creating a macro is
completely complex now identifying the
trouble Microsoft has already come up
with a readily available macro code on
their official website which will
support the various versions of
Microsoft Excel starting from Microsoft
Excel 365 to all the way up to the older
Excel version that is 2010 now you can
scroll down and use this particular
macro function which Microsoft has
readily made us available and use this
to create our own macro in Excel VBA now
let's get back to Excel and you can
create a macro using the developer
option now developer options will not be
readily available in Mac Micosoft Excel
to activate developer option go to home
and go to the options menu in the
last and here go to customize ribbon and
here in the second drop down menu you
can see developer option by default it
will not be checked click on the check
option to activate developer options and
press okay now you have your developer
options ready click on developer options
click on Visual Basic and here to insert
a new macro click on the insert button
click on module and a new mro window is
readily available for you now control V
to paste your code and your function is
with the name number to text right now
close the
matro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name was number to text press tab to
select the function and select the cell
where you have the data close the
function press enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells and here
you have the text converted from numbers
so here we have $102 and you have $102
$22 and no sense $53 and 12 $12 and no
sense and $110 with no sense now that's
how you can convert numbers to words
using the macro which is predefined for
excel in the Microsoft website so for
example uh let us imagine that you
wanted to create one single cell for all
the employees in your company which stes
the first name second name or last name
including the email IDs at one place
right if you want to do so like let us
let us let me show you how it looks like
so let me copy this
here then that's the first name now it's
your second name
along with the email ID now let us
imagine that you wanted to store all the
employees in the same way right so you
can do this by using combine operation
in Excel now all it takes is just a
simple formula that is equals to and the
first cell
address that is
A2 and you can use an ample
sign now you can use the next cell
reference that
B2 and then colon and the last s address
that is E2 now press
enter so when you press enter or tab you
will get this particular answer but this
data is completely uh in a state where
you can't understand it right the first
name last name and the email ID has got
combined all together so you want to use
some spaces right so all you need to do
is just make a little modification to
this particular existing data so you can
press another ENT and include
spaces and then you can separate the
email ID and the name with some
colon so now we have separated the first
two cells that is the first name and the
last name with a space using the ampers
and then again we have used an ENT to
include the colon and see that we have
also included a space between the colon
marks that it gets separated cleanly and
now let's try to press Tab and see the
result so there you go the first name
and the second name is separated by
space and the email ID and the complete
name is separated by a colon now you can
use this to all the
cells and there you go all the first
name last name and the email IDs have
been printed here so that's how you use
the combine operation in Excel and you
can see on my screen we have the sales
data of one single employee in the month
of January okay so this is the sales
data of John in January sales now let us
imagine that we have this same person's
or same John's data of sales of all the
three months okay so here we have the
sales data of John for January February
and March and you wanted to up all these
3 months and write it down as quarter 1
right so let us try doing
it now you can see that uh only January
is replaced as quarter 1 and February
and March are still uh remaining the
same so let us try to delete them so we
have deleted them and I think now it
looks like uh this is a sales data of
oneing quter that is qu 1 but again
quter one is under column B and anyone
who looks at it feels like this data is
of January February and March and all
the quarter 1 details are only present
in V column but C and D are completely
you know different from this one right
so you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cells so that all the data
looks relevant and uh it it defines that
these data elements belong to quoto one
right so there is an option in Excel to
do that so select all the cells that you
want to merge and going to home button
and in home button get into the
alignment group and select merge and
center so you can do it directly also
you have a couple of more options that
is merge and center merge cross merge
sales and unmerge so we'll go through it
one by one so first we'll go through
merge and center so there you go the CES
got merged and it has been aligned into
center now again if your manager or
anyone Superior to you wants this to be
you know independent like they want it
to be in terms of January February and
March so that they can have access to it
in month-wise so you want to unmar it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmerge and there
you go you have your data back in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few
cells there you go and you have it back
right so in a few situations okay you
can also add the poters so that it looks
more relevant now uh you know now let's
try to March this again and merch in
Center yeah now again uh let us imagine
that you are going through an a apprisal
cycle and you also wanted to add some
comments about the sales happening in
your company uh regarding uh all the
employees right so also we have that
here now let me expand a little
bit Yeah there so again let's margin
center
now uh you want it to you know uh you
wanted to take a review of your level
one level two and level three managers
so so you have all the three um rows
here but you can see the cells are not
merged and uh you wanted to merge every
single row so merging and centering
everything rowwise would be a little
time consuming I mean three columns is
okay but what if you had like uh you had
to take a review from a couple of more
manages like 5 to 10 right uh or imagine
you wanted to write some random comments
apart from review you wanted to write
some random comments based on month-wise
uh sales or something like that so it
would be time consuming right so apart
from that you have another option where
you you know select all the sales and
come over here and select the option of
merge
across and all the sales will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and so on
review two right so this is how the
option of of merge across works and we
already have been through the merge and
center and merge is completely similar
to merge and center so this is how merge
and center merge cells and uh merge
across and unmerge cells in Excel now
there are multiple ways to add day to
Excel spreadsheet for example equals to
today this is a shortcut method and you
can enter done you will have today state
but again there is some problem with
this kind of approach so today's date is
4th of September 2022 now if you open
the same spreadsheet after today that is
tomorrow or day after tomorrow then you
will have a concurrent date that is 5th
of September or 6th of September right
the date will always vary or get updated
according to time now you don't want to
change that or you don't want that to be
happening with employee state of joining
right it should be stagnant it should
not vary right so there is another
shortcut way apart from using the
datetime functions there is a keyboard
shortcut where you can add date to excel
that is control semicolon so this is the
shortcut way to add date to your Excel
spreadsheet and this particular date
will not change this will remain the
same constant date throughout the time
now there is a chance where you might
also have to add time to your
spreadsheet that is date of joining and
time of joining right so there is
another simple shortcut where you can
add time by just pressing three keys
that is holding control holding shift
and pressing semicolon then you'll have
the time so this is how you can add date
to your Excel spreadsheet and add time
to your Excel spreadsheet and this date
and time will remain constant it will
not vary like the 2D function that we
have used here so you can see on my
screen we are on the Excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see dates
in column A and different formats in
column C D E and F respectively Now by
default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so for that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option press that
and remember to have the delimited icon
you know you might be having the dash as
your icon or slash as your icon for the
delimited thing and select that and next
next and here you can see right it's in
general mode so you can press on date
and DMI will be a date format that is
date month and year now click on finish
so it's been formatted now now let's
copy this the same data and paste it in
all the four formats so that we'll see
the different formats that we can change
to or customize to right so there you go
let's expand the columns a little bit
now we have day month and year so now
you might want to change a couple of
things right for example you wanted to
change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the sales and right
click and select the format sales option
and in here you can see the date
function and in here you can see
different types of modifications that
you can do to your data right
so you might want to also change your
dates based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you if you're having
your client in us and he wants the dates
in US format you can also change that so
here you can see English United States
and press on that press okay and you can
see it's been changed to us format where
you have years in the first place months
in the second place and dates in the
last place right and now let us imagine
that uh your client does not want the
dates all he needs is just months right
you can also do that get back to the
format sales option go to custom and
here instead of uh you know uh month
date and year all you can do is just
write down month and year and select
okay so you'll have only month and year
not the dates now your client is being a
little more you know he wants a little
more detail and he wants you to add a
lot of uh granularity to your data which
includes day time Etc everything right
so you can also do that so the same way
go to format sales custom and here I
think it's in date itself so let's
navigate a little yeah here so you have
the day date month and year press okay
so there there you go right so that's
how you can do it and now let's try a
little bit more if we have a few more
options
pending so go to format
cells and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and the timings press okay and there you
have all the timings as well so since
these dates are you know I created them
just a few moments ago to keep it simple
so I did not have to add the diamonds
here so if you are Keen about adding the
timings you can also do that for example
if you wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the DAT of birth so this is
completely simple all you have have to
use is the dated IF function or if you
also call it as date diff function based
on your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff in
Excel for further information that video
will be linked in the description box
below you can go through it or you can
use the end screens and I Cuts linked to
this video to get back to the tutorial
based on date diff in Excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these date of births
so all you have to do is type equals to
and type dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select it and give a close
bracket now comma and if you wanted to
calculate the a in terms of days you
have to um you know give d as the
input yeah here it should be D as the
input and don't forget to use the double
codes here and if you use the single
codes there might be an error so use
double codes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months you can give months for now
we want an ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the age here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel and on my Excel spreadsheet let
me expand
it we have two different timings that is
in and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the in
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the AM PM so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24hour timing that is
1320 uh 13:30 so this represents the
24hour
format but since we are you know working
on Office timings let's keep it as AM PM
okay so there you go so we have our uh
timings of in and out now to calculate
the time difference between the in time
and outtime so this particular
calculation is completely simple all you
have to do is press equals to select
outtime minus select end time so there
you go press enter and you have the
total number of asks the employee has
been working in your organization so
here also we have made some minor cell
formatting so usually it comes out as as
Am Pm right but instead of that we have
made a minor cell formatting we have
navigated into time and we have selected
the 24hour formatting so that we have
just hours in our output so that's how
we have calculated the time difference
between two in times and out times of an
employee using Excel now Dax and Excel
is a sophisticated formulas type
language that comes in handy while
working with relational data and
extracting information via Dynamic
aggregation functions Dax in Excel
stands for data analysis Expressions Dax
functions are completely familiar to the
general and default functions that are
available in
Excel now Dax allows users to perform
slightly escalated and advanced and
custom calculations upon various data
types like character data date time time
intelligence functions and many more and
in Dax there are a variety of functions
such as Dax table valued functions Dax
filter functions Dax aggregation
functions time intelligence functions
date and time information time logical
varent and many more now in today's
session we will look into one such type
of Dax function in Excel that is Dax
date and time function in Excel now
without further Ado let's get into
practical
mode and we have started our Microsoft
Excel inside Excel we have open a new
blank worksheet Now navigate to data
option in the toolbar and in that go
to the power pivot
window now we have entered the power
pivot window and inside that you can see
the option of get external data click on
that and you can see a variety of
options that is you can get the external
data from a database you can get from
web servers that is from data service
and you have also other forms of data
sources and existing connections for now
we will take other forms of data that is
a Microsoft Exel data which is in our
local system select next now provide the
location of your folder just
browse and we will select Dax employee
data open and there you go we have our
data connected to our powerpint window
click on next and there you go you have
the selected table and Views click
finish and you can see the data getting
imported into your power window
there you go by default if you want to
add any tax related functions into your
powerp window you'll have an external
added column over here which looks
something like this if there is not an
external column you can also add the
column it's not a big trouble now we
have some data here that is the employee
ID employee name designation of the
employee Department of the employee
salary and joining date Etc it let's EXP
span this View and see what's what's
more in
it so this column is the date of birth
and this column is the employee joining
date right now we have so much of data
now let us imagine that we want to
calculate the retirement age of all the
employees so now let's rename the column
to
retirement
date so we have our new column that is
retirement date now we will make use of
Dax datetime functions to calculate the
age and find out the exact retirement
date of that particular employee so let
us imagine that every employee will
retire after the age of 65 so we have
our date of birth of every employee and
the joining date of every employee now
we'll come up with a Dax date and time
function and calculate the age and then
we will find the retirement date of that
employee now every tax function starts
with the same method or the same way as
the simple Excel default method starts
that is by starting with an equals to
and then we will find
eate eate
and and now our first parameter that is
the start date that is the employee um
the date where the employee joined the
organization so our sheet name is sheet
one
now our joining date is in the F7 column
select F7 press tab to select it and
comma Now how many months so each and
every year will have 12 months so 12
months into the age that is 65 Star 65
and now you can close the uh function
and press enter and then you'll find the
retirement date of that particular
employee so there you go so we have the
employee dates that is Employee
Retirement dates for all the employees
so the first one that is Jack has the
retirement date of 19 February
2085 and similarly Jennifer has her
retirement date at 15th of August 2084
so that's how we use the Dax functions
in Excel so this is one of the several
Dax functions in Excel that is Dax date
and time functions in Excel so you can
see that I've got some data which is
first name of the employee last name of
the employee and phone number and let us
assume that uh your manager has given
you a task to identify all those uh
employees which did not give an phone
number so you wanted to identify them
using a check box right like you will be
providing a check for all the employees
that we have received the phone numbers
and you will not be checking the
employees which did not give the phone
number right so let's try to do that so
to include a checkbox you might want to
get into the developer option but for
few reasons Microsoft has disabled
developer option by default to enable
developer option all you have to do is
just navigate anywhere on the ribbon
here and right click and then you can
see customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirect it
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side
right this one so by default you can see
that your developer option is not
enabled to enable it you have to check
in it and there go you have it now so
press okay and you'll have the developer
option now go to the developer option
and select the insert option and there
you can see the check box now draw the
checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize
this so carefully click
it you can edit the
text and write it as
done
okay now you can even copy this to all
the
sales just select and drag and there you
go now you can go ahead and check all
the employees which you have received
the phone numbers and you can eliminate
the ones which did not provide you with
the phone numbers
that's how you can do it and there's
also another option where you can use
this to include it in a formula since
this data is only of 25 rows you can
manually check in the data and you can
leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will get a True Value here and if it's
not checked you will have a false value
then you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to implement
that you can right click the cell and
you can find format control then you can
see here you have an option called cell
link here select the cell link
and press okay so here you can see if
you have checked this the value is true
and if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see already available check
box you don't have to use any developer
options over here and there you go you
can just check now let us assume that
you're giving an important presentation
and you're also requested by your
manager to add the Excel document that
you have used to create that particular
report which would be something like
this when you click on it it will open a
new Excel document or Excel Window with
all the data in it right so how do we do
that let's look at the demo now let's
have a blank slide and let's get back to
the source where our Excel file is
located that is in my documents so we
are currently in my documents and we
have the Excel file which we used for
creating that particular report now if
we copy and try to paste it on our Excel
document it would look something like
this and clearly it's not visible and
it's not accessible right so instead of
this there is another another way where
you can directly add the Excel document
in the form of logo which is a rather
simple idea all you have to do is just
click on the insert option in the
toolbar then navigate to the text group
and here you will find the option called
object click on the object and it will
give you a new window where you can
identify which type of document or
object you want to add either create or
create from file so we have the file in
our local system so we'll choose create
from file browse and from browse we will
go into the documents section where we
have our Excel file click on the Excel
file and click on okay now if you want
the data or Excel file to be displayed
in the form of an icon then click on the
display as icon section and here you can
change the icon so you can choose any
one of the given options let's choose
this particular one and click on okay
another okay and there you go the icon
will be now displayed on your Microsoft
PowerPoint PPD which is compl completely
clickable as the previous one whenever
you click on this the Excel document
will be opened so that's how you add
Excel document into Microsoft PowerPoint
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand names
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
an image into an Excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image or files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets it's completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the addin
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures uh button click on that
and select from this device or if you
have an online stock image you can take
that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images what we need are simply learn and
simply code logos press okay or insert
so here you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small
buttons
here PR it over
here and
done so you might be wondering is it all
done is there anything more to do uh or
just adding an image is done no most of
the times when you create or you work
with Excel spreadsheet you will not just
you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you will add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
uh uh dashboard and sometimes you might
not have enough play to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular room let us imagine that you
wanted to show only
uh two uh charts and there is no space
for your third chart in such scenarios
you might want to hide or remove that
third chart okay so let's try to hide it
and see if gets if it gets hidden or not
when you try to hide it you can see the
column A has no data and the row number
four has been hidden so we have three
and five but what about the image it is
still present right so if you want to
make sure that the row also hides the
image then you might have to do a little
formatting with it so select the image
go to picture
format or you can also right click and
directly navigate to picture format this
opens up a set of options and here you
might want to go to the U third uh one
which is picture format third and select
the properties and here select the
option of move and size with cells so
when you select this when you try to
hide this it will also I mean the graph
of the image will also hide along with
the R so that's how you do it so how to
insert PDF in Excel now there are
multiple ways to insert a PDF into Excel
so we will go through a couple of ways
first is here let us imagine that we
wanted to insert some PowerPoint
presentation in PDF format into our
Excel sheet so that belongs to excel
Basics now click on the cell where you
want to add the PDF or just click any
cell in the Excel spreadsheet then go to
the option of insert in the toolbar then
navigate to text option click on it and
select
object and here you can select create
from file and then you can browse and
here you have your Excel Basics PDF in
my documents click on that select insert
so
here you can just press okay and the PDF
will be inserted now you can minimize
the size of PDF to fit the
cell there you go the PDF got
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the p PD but instead of that if you
wanted to highlight it as an icon then
you can select the display as icon
button here and press okay now you don't
have to reformat the size of your PPD or
PDF all you have to do is add the logo
to your PDF and it will also include the
title so this is another way of adding
uh you know PDF to your Excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the uh PDF to be
visible or any kind of logo of that PDF
reader to be visible on your spreadsheet
sometimes all you want is some dedicated
image or a dedicated logo right so this
time let's try to add a dedicated image
to our PDF so go to insert again here
you can see the illustrations option
click on picture and from this device so
I will select the simply Lars logo and
now you have to resize the logo a little
bit to fit the cell
there you
go you can uh you click on the right
click button and and select the option
of Link now um select the existing file
or web page option so if you are
interested to learn more on hyperlink
and Excel we have dedicated tutorial on
that please go through hyperlinks in
Excel by simply learn which will explain
you everything about hyper links in
Excel how to insert them different types
of documents to be inserted and how it
works in real time for now let's try to
insert the existing web page and go to
documents navigate to documents and
inside this you have the Excel basic PDF
click on okay and it has been added to
your image so when you click on it it
will open the PDF document attached to
it so when you hover over to the cell
you can see it will ask you a permission
do you want to continue or not just
click on this ignore the warning so you
can see the PDF has been successfully
open convert PDF into
Excel now to do this let's get back to
the Practical mode and try to convert
some PDF data into Excel now you can see
the PDF document which I'm looking to
convert from PDF to excel so this
particular PDF document has a table so
this is the statewise GST collections
that happened during March of 2020 now
we need to convert this tabula data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are on the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can see get data
option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from Azure from other sources
Etc now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a drop-
down and in that drop- down you might
want to select the PDF if you have a
Json file you can also choose from a
Json and if you have the data from XML
you can choose that and even you can
extract the data from text or CSV as
well now we need the PDF option so
select the PDF Now navigate where your
file is existing so my file is on the
desktop and now let me select the PDF
document select import now Excel will
automatically analyze the tab data in
the PDF format and give you the results
now according to excel there are
multiple tabular of formats table one
table two
so basically this table is one and the
same so all the 29 states are fixed in
one table itself but since the PDF is
divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table one
table two and there are few more tables
which Excel is assuming that it might be
table but it's not and another table
which is page number 002 it is a table
and another one is right here now there
is an option of selecting all the tables
all together at once or you can select
only one table which you want to select
so if you select multiple items Excel
will automatically give you an option of
choosing your tables you can just take
and select the tables you want or you
can directly select the table you want
on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting 1 2
4 and five and this particular one is
not a table so I'm eliminating that now
you might want to choose the load option
so Excel is now loading the
[Music]
data now all the data has been
successfully
loaded
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data is been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load to and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be U you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the data is
been successfully loaded in the form of
tabular format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page and in the table
format new
worksheet select
okay and the third
sheet now get ready to impress your boss
by converting all the PDF data into
Excel sheet just in a matter of few
seconds with few steps and there you go
all the four tables have been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps now this is how you
convert PDF to excel that is how to add
tick mark in Excel now on my spreadsheet
you can see some employe data so they've
been assigned a task and they want to
update the task status as done and not
done using symbolic statements that is
tick mark and into marks now how to do
that it is really simple we'll discuss
two different ways the first way is to
do it by conditional formatting so click
a sell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
rule yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automate it so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two color scale select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Mark you have various types
of them you know the circular Tech Mark
and let's select the generic tick mark
without any outer circles and into here
generic X Mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than
zero it will be green and when the value
is less than or equal to zero it will be
X and the reference value is zero and
here also the reference value is zero
everything is okay click on okay and
done
and here you cannot see the logos yet we
need to add some formula here which is
equals to if click on Tab to select the
symbol and if Cell address C2 is equals
to
done then the value should be one else
the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the
rules and here you can see show icon
only click okay and the numbers will be
removed also edit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here here go to
Advanced customized ribon and in here on
the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the checkbox as well now you can
click on it and say if it's done or not
that is how to add Watermark to excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we wanted to add some Watermark
logo to your uh Excel spreadsheet so
that it looks genuine and work by you
right so that's the overall idea of
adding a watermark now go to the insert
window and in the insert window go to
the text option click on that select
header and footer once you select header
and footer you can see something on your
screen like this so in this box which is
highlighted by a cursor is where you're
going to add the picture on my top in
the menu bar you can see header and
footer elements in this select the
picture element and it will navigate to
you to a different option window since
we are adding the image from our local
system select from file or if you are
adding from your Bing or any search
window you can also add that or one
drive as well but now let's go with from
file it will directly navigate you to
the pictures folder in your local system
so here is my simply learns logo click
on it and select insert now you can see
the images added in this format which is
ENT and picture and you might wonder
where is the picture it is actually
present to view it click on any cell in
the spreadsheet and there you go you can
see it now you might be wondering the
image is a little towards top and
abnormally placed right so no worries
you can always you know format your
picture just press enter and use enter
to move your picture towards the center
of your data spreadsheet and also there
is another option of format picture
altogether here you can adjust the
height and width of your image by you
know increasing and decreasing width or
increasing and decreasing height using
the arrow marks also works and and apart
from this there is another option of
picture formatting where you can choose
your image to be washing out black and
white gray scale or anything so
currently I'm going with automatic which
will automatically adjust the brightness
and you know everything for your image
it looks perfectly fine so click on okay
and there you go right so now this
should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to
normal you might be confused right where
is the logo it vanish did I have to save
it no it's already saved everything is
fine even the image is there but you
cannot see it in normal view to see it
click on file click on print then you
can see the logo it will be present only
on the printed Pages not on the normal
field okay so that's how you work with
watermarks and Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel how to modify or increase
cell size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the cell
as you know just to increase the
visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do do you can also
modify by hovering over to the line
between two columns and right click
which will give you the option of format
cells or column width so either of these
options will help you to maximize or
minimize your column width similarly you
can apply the same idea for your rows as
well so you can either format the cells
or modify the row height of your cell
and this is another way and another simp
simple way is to just hold that line and
drag it so it improves your width of the
column and another way is to just over
onto that line and hold it and drag it
to improvise or increase your width of
the cell and same applies to your row so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
sales from this particular option in the
home button you can select this and here
you have the row height autofit row
height column width autofit column width
for example let us imagine that you
wanted to you know just by mistake you
uh you increase the cell size and you
wanted to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the autofit height and click on
the autoit column width there you go it
happens in that way and now coming back
to
another simplest way let us imagine that
you are given a lot of data and you are
told to autoit all the rows and columns
now we have already already seen the
format cell option where will auto fit
all the columns and width of the column
and also the height of the rows Etc
right but there is also a keyboard
shortcut to do this so all you have to
do is select a cell and press CR a to
select all the cells in the spreadsheet
and once all the cells are selected all
you have to do is press and hold ALT key
and then release it then the combination
of keys that is H oi
so your column width has been now
adjusted now the same formula or the
same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or auto
fit all the cells in Excel now you can
see that we have the First Column that
is a column and the first set of that is
text and all the other cells are numbers
but as a whole Excel considers the whole
column as a general data format so why
are we discussing about this so to
create a barcode in Excel you have to
make sure that all the elements in the
column are of Text data type so the
first step is to convert this General
data type to Text data type so you can
do that by going into the data type and
selecting text and now all the elements
in your first column A are type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the barcode font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to
Google so on the Google you want to
search uh for barode font for Excel so
the one that I would recommend is 3 of9
barcode
font now you can down download this font
by just clicking on the download button
over here now I've already downloaded
this font on my local system let's now
try to install that now the three of9
barcode folder will come in the form of
zip folder you have to unzip that and
after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of9 new select that and
you'll be having the installer file over
here you can install by selecting the
install button over here so I have
already installed it in my local system
system so it is readily available for me
on my Microsoft Excel now we might want
to create the barcode for this
particular cell in A2 so let's create
that so to create a barcode we need to
write in a formula that is equals to
double
codes star double codes and ampers
symbol address of the cell that is A2
another ampers symbol again double codes
star symbol and double codes so you can
either use this or instead of star you
can use brackets as
well so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all the cells so that you can apply the
formula to all the codes now I got all
the codes over here now select all the
cells get into the fonts and here select
the barcode font and there you go you
have the barcode for all the numbers you
have in your column A so that's how you
create barcode in Excel Excel flashfill
is a feature of Microsoft Excel where
Excel can sense a pattern in a cell and
apply the same logic to extract the
similar resultant pattern out of the
remaining cells in a table might be a
little confusing right so let us say
simplify it so let us imagine that you
have a text in one of the cells in the
Excel sheet and you want it to trim a
part of that text for example let us
imagine that there is an assembly an
assembly where the car parts are
assembled together to finish a car so
each and every part has a code the
serial number the product code and the
assembly code Etc right and you wanted
to separate all those three if you
wanted to do that you might want to use
the trim function which might be a
little treats of apply to all the cells
but what if if I say there is a simple
key format using which you can fill all
the columns in the Excel sheet within a
fraction of second sounds interesting
right so that's exactly the flashfill
function in Excel
does now before we get started let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple Technologies if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply Now without further Ado
let's get started with the flashfill in
Excel for that we might want to start
the Excel to get in the Practical mode
now we are on the Microsoft Excel and
remember the example we discussed so
this is a similar example now the first
column in the sheet is the product
detail so this product detail consist of
the product code that is 112 next we
have the product serial number that is 1
025 637 and lastly the assembly code
that is a SN X now we want to separate
this product detail into three columns
where we have the First Column to be
storing the product code second one to
be storing the product serial number and
the last one to be storing the assembly
code so now if you want to do that using
trim function you might want to apply
the trim function here and trim out the
left part and again for the product
serial number you might want to use the
trim function again which might go into
a little complicated pattern So to avoid
the complications and and decrease the
time spent we we might want to use the
flashfill in Excel now let us help Excel
about the pattern that we might want to
generate so the pattern is one12 and the
next one is
322 so now you can see that the text was
highlighted that was the intimation from
the Excel that it understood the pattern
now going into the next cell and holding
the control key and pressing the E
button will help us to fill the
remaining cells in the column B so
that's how it is done and similarly
let's try out for the serial
number for that the serial number is
102
5637 now in the next cell we have
13
6582 now we can go to the third cell and
press CR e for Windows and if you're
using a Mac operating system then you
have to press command e and all these
serial numbers will be filled so this
will reduce the time in separating the
pattern and filling the
columns now let's try the last column
that is as SX which happens to the
assembly code next we have FG and V now
the shortcut method that is contr e and
there you go now you might be wondering
will it work only for numbers etc etc or
the text which is properly aligned or
separated using a hyphen no it can also
be used for some random text which is
like this so let us imagine that we have
a text which is of length like 20 or 30
and you wanted to print only a part of
it so here I'm going to print the
alphabets from position fourth to
position e8th so I've already tried the
first one that is taking out the
alphabets from fourth location to the
eighth location or the pattern of the
text that is i f e r from Jennifer Lopez
and in the next cell we have the numbers
starting from the location 4 to 8 so
that is
7767 and similarly we have the other
cells consisting of the names of few car
that is Alpha Romeo Bugatti Von and next
we have Superman Returns text so now
let's press the shortcut key that is CR
e and make sure that all the remaining
cells are filled so that's how the Flash
Fill works so the Flash Fill in Excel
will reduce the time consumed to fill
all the columns by separating the text
in your main cell that is the column a
which we have here in this example and
it also reduces the complexity of using
a trim function in Excel as hyperlinks
in Excel now hyperlink is something
which is clickable and when you click on
it it will redirect you to a different
web page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write simply
long now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have selected this
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and you will
again have the dialog box of the
hyperlink and Excel and the Third Way is
right click on the cell and you can see
the link option in the last and this
will enable the hyperlink option in
Excel now let's create a hyperlink the
simplest way again crl K now we have a
variety of options that is existing file
or web page place in this document
create a new document and an email
address so we will address all of these
one at each time so first one existing
file or a web page now you can select an
existing PDF file or any file in your
local system and hyperlink or create a
hyperlink to the text or you can select
a website link and place it over here
and create it as a hyperlink
Let's uh explore both the options first
let's try to explore the web page option
so since I have written as simply learn
let's use the website link of Simply
learn and create a
hyperlink let me open
Google new tab and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel workbook
now here let's place the hyperlink now
you can press okay and there you go the
hyperlink has been successfully created
now this link is clickable when you
click on it it will redirect you to a
new simply learns home web page right so
this is how you create a hyperlink to a
website now we should explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file and okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control ke now let's
select existing file or web page option
now here you can see navigate key press
on that and let's navigate our files
let's select all files you here remember
to select all files okay by default it
shows as office files now let's explore
our file option
so let's select uh fundamentals of
computer programming option which is a
PDF file press okay and there you go we
have created a hyperlink so when I click
on this you can directly navigate to an
existing PDF file in your local system
and it will be open as a web page click
on it and you can see the PDF file now
close now another thing when you
navigate on to this you'll see the
lengthier HTTP uh address and same
happens here right so if you're a little
uncomfortable watching this lengthier
link you can also edit it you can choose
the option of edit
hyperlink
and see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display option
and write it as click here to know
more PR
okay again press okay and now if you
navigate onto it instead of seeing a
lengthier hyperlink what you can see is
click here to know more okay I think I
made a spelling mistake so I think I
forgot and E somewhere over here yes
click here to know more and press okay
right so here you can see click here to
know more let's try this again over
here so
edit edit hyperlink screen tap option
and instead of the ler text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes or
PDF click okay and click another okay
and you are done so instead of seeing
that lengthier hyperlink you can see
click here to open PDF right so so far
we have explored two options that is
existing file and existing web
page right now let's try to explore
another option again uh hyperlink right
click hyperlink and here you have seen
places in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
want it to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write as navigate me to here okay
so now what we will do is so here we
will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document you can see the sheet to
option and the cell reference is A1
where we have written navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell okay
let me also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right now
let create
that control
K let me select sheet two and the S
address is A1 press okay now what did uh
what What's the change right when you
click on this you will be redirected to
sheet to cell A1 navigate me to here
right so this can be like a shortcut
when you have multiple sheets like 100
sheets then you can uh you know have a
different column over here and uh add
the navigation address to all those cell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case I have given
sheet to address cell A1 right so this
is another trick now let's get back to
the hyperlink thing again uh control K
and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having what's say
some cheat sheets or uh clip on clip
goats right so uh let us imagine that
you're working through uh a huge
worksheet and uh you wanted to you know
uh have a a track of everything and keep
notes updating right so it might be a
little complicated to understand so let
me show it practically so let me write
it down as clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has a hyper is
okay this can be used no
worries back
to uh hyperlink option
again create new document now here you
can create a variety of uh documents
right so it can be a text document it
can be an Excel document it can be a PDF
document right for now we'll create a
text document okay uh we'll name it as
uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me take documents here and select okay
so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents folder and uh
you can also choose to edit the document
later or edit the document now let us
select edit the document now press okay
and there you go so you have your text
tracker here so let us imagine that we
have worked on the Excel sheet and we
wanted to write down us a sticky note uh
so that we can remember what we have
done on the Excel sheet so update
one and uh update two now you can close
it so it'll ask for a save option save
it and done and let us imagine that you
did something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and
close so that's how you keep track of
your sticky note and you'll have all
your updates right now getting back to
the hyperlinks
again uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add uh okay let's
imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send him out an email
right so it would be a little timec
consuming that you open your email and
compose something and send it over here
but what if you had uh one single click
and access to the email compose option
right that can be done so let us write
down
email
colle B me with the spelling so again
the control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend
gmail.com
and can write the subject about
update and press okay this will navigate
you to the Gmail option or the mailing
address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 Yahoo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail and all you have to do is login
you know all the formalities and you're
good to go with
emailing so let's skip this for now so
you you know how to do the rest parts so
so far we have uh you know covered all
the hyperlink options in Excel that is
existing file or a web page place this
in in the current executing worksheet or
document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have
covered everything around hyp Link in
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed out anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel you can feel free to
let us know roundoff formula in
Excel now for this particular tutorial
we will be using the student data set
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and start our Microsoft Excel now we are
in the Microsoft Excel and as you can
see on my sheet okay let me expand
this so as you can see on my screen we
have the data set belonging to students
so we have 10 students and every one of
them has name role number class blood
group and marks Etc and at the end we
have the percentage and as you can see
we have the percentage in terms of float
values and we have a lot of decimal
values like eight and above so what if
you wanted to just have one or two
digits after the actual percentage like
80.6 or 80. 66 right it would be a
little bit more or good to read right so
that's what a roundoff actually means so
now let's work on having rounded off
values for the percentage now let's
create a new
column let's name it as
um round
of
percentage
great so to actually perform the
roundoff uh formula we do have a
predefined method for that for that you
just have to type
in equals to
round and there you go we have round up
and round down so both of them perform
the same operation let's select a round
up and this is the m column and the row
number is three so we'll have to press
M3 and the number of values after the
decimal point for now let's select um
one and there you go press enter and the
Val should be rounded off now 80. 66 is
being rounded off to
80.7 now when you drag the cell to the
all the rules then you can see all the
values will be rounded off here you can
see 75.1 16 has been rounded off to 75.2
and 82.3 3 is been rounded off to 82.4
so we end up with having grounded
of so first we will understand what
exactly is is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calculated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of squared deviations
from the mean now what are deviations so
slowly you can understand that we're
getting into the topic of statistics and
graphs so uh before getting deep into it
let's understand what is deviation so
the deviation is a measure that is used
to find the difference between the
observed value and the expected value of
a variable in simple terms deviation is
the distance from the center point so
for example when you are going through a
graph so you will be expecting some
value right and if you get some
difference that is above or below the
expected point that is called the
deviation what is the between the
expected point and the obtained point so
that is the deviation now next is the
observed value so the observed value is
the value that you get in real time
unlike the predicted value so now you
might be thinking to calculate standard
deviation we might need a few more
parameters and you're exactly right so
to calculate standard deviation in Excel
you need variance and then you need
deviation and then you need mean right
so all the these parameters are supposed
to be calculated first and then you will
be having the final formula to calculate
standard TV now that we understood the
theoretical and formula based
explanation about standard deviation
it's time we calculate the standard
deviation using one of the most popular
business intelligence tool that is
Microsoft Excel so let's get back to the
Practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
it yeah there you go so as discussed
before to calculate standard deviation
we might require the mean variance
deviation and deviation squared and then
we can calculate the standard deviation
so let's go step by step so the first
one is calculating sum right so to
calculate average we might need some of
all the scores so we have the index
values that is 1 to 10 and scores of
each index value that is 1 to 10 right
now let's calculate the sum of all
values here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them C N tab space to select
and select the number of cells press
enter and you have count now what's the
mean so mean is simply the app average
of all the numbers right so you can
either divide the sum by count or you
can simply use the average function so
let's try to use the average function so
that we also have an idea of how the
average function Works press tab to
selected and select all the cells press
enter now you have the average or mean
value now we have the main value and now
after finding the main value we are
supposed to find out the deviation so
remember the deviation that is the
difference between the obtained value
and the predicted value right so the
obtained value is this one which is here
in C2 and the predicted value is this
one that is 82.6 that's our mean right
according to formula we supposed to
eliminate the value of obtained minus
the mean right so select uh the cell
equals to C2 minus the obtained value
that is mean now press F4 to freeze the
value and now press enter so that you
can freeze the value and drag the
formula across all the cells now you
have the
deviation
right now the next step is to find the
sum of all the deviation numbers so
either you can apply the sum formula to
all these numbers or you can just drag
this cell over here and the formula will
be automatically copy now similarly the
count function to count all the values
that us drag it and you'll have it over
here right now the next step is to find
out the square deviations or the square
of the deviations which is really simple
all you have to do is equals to select
the cell and uh see that small hat kind
of logo on the number six use that now
into two press
enter you have the square similarly drag
the same formula across all the Cs and
you'll have your squared numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final
formula now we have the mean value that
is over here let's color
it and we have the variation
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape and
we have d deviation as well let's color
it in a different
shape now we need to find the variance
and after we find the variance the last
step is to count the standard deviation
or calculate the standard deviation so
what is the formula to calculate the
variance so for variance you need the
sum of deviation
Square divided by total number of
values minus 1
PR Center and that's your variance now
the standard deviation so the standard
deviation is really simple you need to
calculate the variance to the power
of5 and that's your standard
deviation so that's how you calculate
standard deviation in Excel I hope all
the formulas and the explanation was
clear so you can see that we have got
started with Microsoft Excel and on the
left hand side we have a simple table
with all the teams in an IT industry
starting from it admin testing
development to client consultant support
we have got everything in this
particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
lookup value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us consider
that we want to find the index value of
Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup
value now how to find the index value of
the element marketing for that we will
be using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three different parameters so the
first one is the lookup value second is
the lookup array and lastly we have
match type so lookup value is the value
of which you are trying to find the
index that is marketing this particular
cell so we have selected the lookup
value which is the first one next we
have to select the lookup array that is
from which set of elements you want to
find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created the a column now
we have selected the lookup array and
lastly the match type is it you're
looking for less than or is it you're
looking for exact match or is it greater
than match so for now I want exact match
so I will be selecting the exact match
that is
zero now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing three
development 4 marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in Excel
now we just have like 10 elements so we
have got the uh writing of the elements
or you know uh choosing the elements in
a easy way but what if if you had like
100 elements right could be a little
different okay so let me put it simple
now you wanted to find the index value
of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you miss out a letter
A okay now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
themes that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over
here equals to
match look up
value look up
array and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team whichever
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in Excel to sort data in Excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and g
you can see employee date of birth and
employee date of shining for example you
wanted to sort the employe data in the
form of earliest joining employee and
the latest joining employee right that
is who is the employee who joined first
to this company and who is the employee
who joined last to this company so for
that you just need to select the column
of date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so need to
make sure that we have the proper data
type which is State now that we have the
proper data type select the entire
column and go to the data option and
here select the sort option and in the
sort option select the expand selection
click on sort and here sort by employee
data joining and oldest to newest that's
what we want it the oldest employee or
the you can also set it to the newest
employee to oldest according to your
your requirement but we'll go to oldest
to newest according to the case study
right now just click on okay and that
should be done so Emily who's a manager
is the oldest employee who joined the
company and Chris who is A traine in it
support is the latest employe who joined
the company now that's how you sort date
in now on my screen you can see the
sales of four quarters from different
regions that is east west south north
and Central now you might want want to
calculate the sum of sales happened from
all the regions in q1 or you might want
to calculate the sum of sales happened
in one region of all the four quarters
that is either you want to calculate the
sum of all the regions from quarter 1 or
you might want to calculate the sum of
all the quarters in one region right so
to do this you have some simple
functions in Excel so you might say me
you have some function Etc right for
that you might want to go into the you
know equals to mode and fetch some
option and subtotal or some you have to
select the function from here but what
if I tell you that there is one simple
easy shortcut where you just have to
make one single click and you'll have
all the sum right so that seems
interesting so on the top in the home
bar select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is
summation so you have different
aggregations here sum average count
numbers maximum minimum more functions
here you might want to select the sum
and you can get all the sumission
numbers here so I'll select one cell so
the second query where we wanted to
calculate the sum of all the sales
happened in each region with all the
quarters included that is this one C2 to
F2 right so let us select G2 and select
the autosome option and here it will
automatically select the range for you
that is C2 to FS2 if you want to change
it can also you know change it like
minimize the number if you just wanted
to calculate the sum of three quarters
you can do that so now we want to four
quarters so select enter and there you
go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of east region now if you
simply drag it you will have the sum of
all the four quarters of all different
regions
now let us calculate the summation of q1
of all the regions that is this one
Select Autos sun and it will
automatically select all the cells for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q4 sales of all regions
now let us try to change the color that
you can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's a total sum or right
you just have a reference to identify
it now similarly to this one as
well so that's how you implement Auto
sum in Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet so you can see that I have
five different sheets of the same data
so why do we have that so I'll be
explaining you how to sort data for
multiple parameters so firstly we will
try to sort data in the form of numbers
right so let us imagine that this data
is being shared with you by your manager
and he wants you to sort this data based
on the salary numbers so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order
maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any sell in the salary
column get into the sort and filter
options and here select this sort of
arrangement you need that is largest to
smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to to
find the highest salary click on largest
to smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation is senior and
he works in it support and he draws the
highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the sheet two and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employ date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or the
sort the data from newest to the oldest
so since we want the oldest employee
select oldest to newest and there you go
so the oldest emplo employ is Alfred who
is an associate designation employee and
he works in the admin department and
he's drawing the salary of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in this same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here now uh single column wise
is perfectly fine there is no issues
with that now you wanted to you know uh
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh okay let's keep a few columns so
we'll just keep employee name and
employee salary okay so here we are
trying to demonstrate if you are uh
trying to sort the data using one cell
in the column B will it maintain its
relationship with the cell a okay uh
that's our query right so let's see I'll
go a little detail so let us imagine
that you wanted to sort this data based
on highest salary okay so when you do
that will it also impact the cells in
the column A
so it will basically impact but just uh
it's a query right any of you viewers
might have that query will I uh if in
case if I try to sort the data based on
this will it affect the cells on the
rest of the data set okay so in
basically it will impact so I'll try to
you know sort the data based on
ascending
order so this is the smallest to largest
and you can see uh the Tony and pepper
so since since I selected the cell in
the column B it also impacted the change
on the cells of column A so that's how
the Sorting works now we'll get to a
little Advanced um sorting techniques so
here we try to I mean already we try to
sort the data based on numbers based on
alphabets based on U you know uh date
date of birth right so I think we forgot
the uh ascending or you know sorting
based on alphabets let's do that as well
select any sell in the column A and go
to S filter try selecting a to z or okay
let's try to Z to A okay so here you can
see the U names have been sorted based
on the descending order from Zed to a
right so so far we tried on alphabets so
far we tried on numbers date of birth
and a couple of more things so let's dig
a little deeper and try to sort based on
colors right so for that you don't uh
you know find that uh extra setting here
in the regular sortant filter so you
might want to get into the data option
and here you'll find another sort
function which is a little Advanced so
that's how you do it so since we have
colored in the cell or column of salary
select that salary and we're going with
cell value so in the cell values section
select the cell color and here on the
cell color options you'll have green
blue and yellow that's what we have used
in our um cells so let's keep keep Green
in the first position which is on top
and press okay now you'll see green is
been sorted to the first position now
yellow and blue are left out so why is
that so because you didn't provide it
right so you can do what that as well I
mean you can always add uh the setting
to
it right select any cell go to sort and
add a level and then again select the
salary and cell values to cell colors
and now the cell color in the second
position would be blue and that will be
on bottom and I can add another level
the same
salary the cell values will be cell
color and uh cell yellow will be
somewhere in between or bottom okay so
based on hierarchy uh it will be
selecting press
okay and there you go so you have S
yellow and blue at the bottom and green
at the top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this last sheet we are going
to you know um dig a little deeper into
the advanc Sorting methods so previously
we tried to apply the advanced sorting
methods for colors now we'll try to
apply the advanced sorting methods based
on the data set we have here I mean the
data we have in our data set right so
select the sort option and let's add a
few details right so firstly let's sort
the column employee ID okay so let's
have the smallest to largest or yeah now
that would be good now let's add another
level where we will
sort okay uh I think we will sort based
on employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employee name here and here will be
employee salary okay now the sell values
and this would be from a to zed and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from a to zed so the employees name
starting from a to zed will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output
so there you go the names are Alfred and
you have the highest salary here
smallest to highest so this is 25,000
next we have Banner Barnes and Ben so
here you might be seeing why we have Ben
in the third position despite he has the
low salary and name starts with B right
so here it is trying to work based on
the alphabets in the order right so B A
and be e it's not just comparing the
first letter it's also comparing the
following letters as well right so n
comes first R comes later so B is pushed
to the second position a comes first and
E comes later so B A letters r pushed to
the first position and Ben is pushed to
the third position so that's how it
works right so accordingly the set for
BA is created here 3540 next Ben 12 and
next you have Bobby Brian Brock Chris
Clark right so that's how the data has
been organized and sorted based on
multiple levels of parameters you Prov
re for sorting so that's how you use
sorting in Excel slicers and filters in
Excel so slicers in Excel are software
filters used along with Excel tables or
Excel pivot tables over a large amount
of data not just filtering out data but
slices also help you with an easy
understanding of the information being
extracted and displayed on the screen
now Microsoft Excel slices are
compatible with Windows and Mac and to
operating systems now let us understand
how to Implement slicers in Excel so for
that we might want to get back to the
Practical mode that is starting our
Microsoft
Excel now we are on our Excel sheet and
as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which has been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this SLI in
Excel we might want to create or convert
the format of database into a normal
table for that you can select all your
data and just press contr T and that
will allow you an option called convert
the data into table now since this table
is already converted as a table we can
directly start implementing or inserting
slices into the spreadsheet
now for that select all your
data then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
options since we have the columns
employee ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees date of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our
slices now let us try to rearrange these
slices all you can do is just select and
drag them up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the EAS Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony bner Fred Etc
and their Department design
etc etc all on one single screen so this
really helps you while you're presenting
your data in a presentation now for a
change let's try to select the
department now if your client wants to
select the data from only analytics
Department then you might want to select
on the analytics key on the department
slicer and there you go you have an
employee called Luke hops who works in
the East Zone and his department is
analytics and his designation is cont
contract based and the salary he is
getting is
65,000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and your client
also wants data from it support now you
can see that analytics is gone but what
if you want both analytics and it
support then you have an option called
select multiple then you can select
analytics and it support and if you want
HR you can also do that and in the zone
if you want West along with East then
you can do the same east and west and
you have all the employee details and in
the designation let's try to select U
senior
traine okay select multiple senior
trainee and manager so that's how you do
it so that's how it's done and that's
how you implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation it is
really simple to add filters in Excel so
we are on a practical mode right now so
on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right so now let us imagine
that we want to add filters on the
region part so we have south west east
Etc right so we want to you know let us
imagine that you want to extract the
data of only west region and you wanted
a filter so doing it manually could take
a lot of time so using filters will be
helpful now select one cell on the
headers part and select the filter
option in the data toolbar you can see
the data option on the toolbar right so
click on the data option and navigate to
sort and filter uh group and in that
select the option of filter now you can
see the filters are been added to all
the column headers region category state
subcategory sales quantity right now we
wanted the West category so when you see
or when you click on the drop down icon
you can see all the options are selected
right the central east west south every
everything right but now we just want
West one so click on West and select
okay there you go so you have everything
from the west region now let's imagine
that you wanted to look into uh office
supplies only or technology only right
you can do the same with the technology
and press okay and now you'll have all
the technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel or that that's how you
add filters in Excel goalseek in Excel
so for this tutorial we'll be
considering the students database now
let's get back to the Excel so now we
are on the Excel sheet and you can see
that in this particular Excel sheet we
have some student details we have the
serial numbers names role numbers class
blood group and some subjects like math
science computer statistics social GK
and the final marks obtain percentage
and total marks right so so let us
imagine that uh a company has come for
an interview so all these students are
going to attend an interview and uh the
minimum percentage to attend the
interview will be like
75% so you can see that we have 75 here
and all the students have got above 75
except for the one student which is Mike
right so for Mike to attend the
interview he needs 75 percentage or
above so uh he can make some modific
ations in one of these subjects right so
there is always an exam after the exam
called as Improvement exam so if you can
like to score some extra marks in the
subjects which you have scored less so
that you can make up to the percentage
what you're expecting you can do that so
here in this particular sheet uh Mike
has six subjects right and in six
subjects you can see he has code 76 91
45 71 94 and 62 so out of these he have
scor Less in one subject compared to all
the subjects one subject is really low
that is computers so what if he can give
an improvement exam and increase his
percentage to 75 right so that can be
done so we can do some root Force
methods like we can change the marks
like 55 and then check this particular
one so it's getting 74 right so using
the brute force method will be a little
bit lengthy so you can do this because
it is just a small uh table which has
least number of data and you just have
one single cell to modify so that can be
done in small tables but what if you had
some table with hundreds of rows or
thousands of rows that'll be time
consuming right so for that we have some
inbuilt functionality in Excel that is
called goal seek in Excel so for now
let's eliminate the marks
here so we have eliminated the marks and
the upgraded percentage is 65 now we
need the target as
75 okay so let's uh write it
as Mike's Target right we need mic so
mik new Target
as 75
[Music]
okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75
percentage we will use the data
operation so here on the toolbar which
has file home insert Etc we have one
other option called as data so when you
click on data from toolbar you'll have
this ribbon and in this ribbon we have
various options so when you come into
forecast group we have an option called
wh if analysis when you click on what if
analysis you'll have a set of options
out of which we have goal seek now for
goal seek we need to select a table cell
that is this particular table cell that
is
M9 so we need the value 75 here right so
what is the cell that you need to change
here for that you need to select this
one and select this particular cell here
right and now you can select okay now
you can see that Excel has automatically
run all the permutations and
combinations and has come up with a
number so that the overall percentage of
mic will be 75% right so the expected
marks that Mike should be getting in his
computer's Improvement exam should be
equal to 56 or greater than 56 to get
the final Target at 75 so that he can
attend the company's interview so this
is how we use goal set or goal seek in
Excel we are on our Excel spreadsheet
and here you can see I'm trying to
create an calendar for the employees in
the company where you might have to you
know write down the day and month and
year or week of your birth date or maybe
your joining dat or maybe also your last
working day right this might be useful
for all the employees to you know uh
avoid them from writing it down manually
so how do I create it so it takes a few
simple steps all it takes is some data
validation methods and also there is an
exclusive video specifically made on
data validation in Excel link to which
is in the description box below or you
can search it on our official YouTube
channel now you can see that uh the word
calendar is on the first cell that is A1
but we have four cells below it that is
A3 B3 C3 and D3 so you might want to add
this to all the cells right like May in
the middle so for that you can do the
option of mergin Center also there is a
tutorial on mergin Center about all the
options available in this particular
thing so you can go through that also
and uh yeah we have done the first step
now all we need is day month year and
week so in a calendar or in a month
you'll have days from 28 29 30 or 31
days right so let's create a list or the
drop down menu for that so that when you
click it right so whenever you click on
that particular cell you will have the
list of all the days available right so
let's get started with that let's create
a new
sheet so why are we creating a new sheet
you won't want that all the numbers in
your calendar sheet right over here
right so for that so we are creating a
new sheet and all the data will be
available here so here let's write down
the days first and here the second
number also you can use the option of
Flash Fill so that you can you know uh
reduce the effort here so you can see
the flash full option over here all you
need to do is select the CES and drag
them down until you get your required
dates right so let's keep it till 31
days there you go you have the days so
these will be your days and here now the
next option was month right yeah month
and yeah now using the same flash F
option you will you know add the months
into your sheet so this will be
Sunday so Excel has this smart flash F
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be fill according to
your requirements so Sunday to Saturday
now the next one right that is your
month so same as the before process
we'll create
January you can use the Flash B option
and all the way up to December now the
last one was the
year so
1990 and
1991 so you can select the cells and
Flash Fill
up to
2022
maybe yeah 2022 should be good enough
now this is The Flash option you have
here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on flash all together you can
go through it for a detailed explanation
as well now coming back to the original
sheet so this is where you create your
drop down list right so select the cell
where you want to add the done list
navigate to data and then here is your
data validation menu so we have a
variety of data validation options over
here there is an exclusive tutorial on
that you can go through it for now we'll
look into the list option only because
we want to create a drop down list right
so here it will ask for Source click on
the source here the source bar right now
navigate to sheet number two where we
have the days options select the
range so this will be your range and
select okay also you can add some
message here right what you can do is uh
in case if there is an error or
something right you don't want that to
be happening so all you need to do is uh
write down and select from
dropdown select from dropdown only
so this could be a message select from
drop down only the title is Select
options or just
options in case if there's an error you
can write down your title as invalid
data and you can write down a messages
please
from drop down
only so um in case of someone tries to
write as 32 or 33 to check the Integrity
of your data validation then they will
encounter an error and an error message
and then they must be understanding what
exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and valid so okay and
here you can see select from the drown
list only options with with option list
as title and let's try to enter 32 right
and when you press enter you will see an
error so the error messages invalid data
please try to select from drop down only
so you can go for a retry and select the
drop down
right so let's eliminate them and now
select something from the drop down so
let's take it
as maybe 10 right so this is how you
cleared the day one now let's try to do
with the month same data validation
option settings will be list and Source
will be
this
one think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet to and
rename this as our week yeah now coming
back to the month again
it will be a
list and the source will be in sheet 2
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and input message the same
options select from dropdown only
and error alert title will be invalid
data this one will be please
select from
dropdown
on it's okay and that's done now let's
continue with your as well let's quickly
do the same
it will be a list Source will be in
sheet
2 this is your list press okay and
lastly the week same process it will be
a list Source will be in your sheet two
the input
message
options title invalid
data drop down
only right so your drop down list is
ready now so the month will be anything
So currently we have me and the year can
be anything anywhere so let's take it as
997 and week can be you know the
adjacent week so what was 10th of May
1997 let's check our calendars
was a
Saturday so it was a Saturday and that's
how you create drop down list in Excel
and if you want you can also add borders
to your calendar right so that's how
it's done
so what is data validation in Excel so
it is a feature by Microsoft Excel where
it can restrict data entry into certain
cells by using data validation and it
will prompt the users to enter valid
data in the cells based on the rules and
restrictions provided by the creator of
that particular sheet now this would be
a little confusing to understand so to
understand it in a much better way let's
get back to the practical way where we
will start entering some dat validation
rules to our Excel sheet and try to
enter data into it now we are on the
Microsoft Excel and this particular
sheet is based on employee ID employee
name employee Department employee salary
fiscal year and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employee ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering m employe ID it would be
a whole number so let us select whole
number option and now here you can see
the option of between not equal to equal
to not between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide 10,000
and
11,000 now select okay and now the new
rule has been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one there you go you can see that
Microsoft Excel is not allowing you to
include a wrong number it says this
value does not match the data validation
restrictions defined for this cell so
now you can press retry and try to enter
some number which is in between 10,000
to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us just assume that
because I'm the creator of this shet I
know what should be entered here but
what if I give this sheet to you and
you're the person who's trying to enter
the number and it shows the error and
you don't know what was the error right
to avoid this kind of confusion what you
can do is you can do some uh ways where
you can provide the message to the user
so that can be done by okay let's select
the sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter EMP
ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please please
enter data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid
data
10
9
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let
let's get into the employee name where
we have to
provide uh the second type that is text
length now let us imagine that uh in
your company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or uh 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15 and
press okay okay minimum will change it
to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character data
please enter valid
name and error
[Music]
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than 50
press
okay now let us try to enter a random
name okay uh we'll enter characters more
than 15 here
qu
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters
yeah now we have entered more than 15
characters and it is showing please
enter characters less than 15 so now we
can retry and try to enter some valid
name
uh now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another name
I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the
other ones first that is employee salary
physical year and work timings after
that we'll learn about uh the list
one now let's come into employee salary
so salary is something where you have to
include decimal points so now let us go
to uh data validation and inside the
values we have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll uh deal with
employee salary that is decimal now
minimum is okay what is uh minimum can
be
1. 0 and maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just then
enter valid
salary okay now let's change it to
minimum is
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between 10,000
to 10
lakhs let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please enter
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and the
data validation conditions are apply to
this column now let us try to enter some
invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide
20,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscally let
us imagine that we wanted to you know
work on the employees for current
working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that you need
to select the entire column go to data
validation settings and inside here you
have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/01 SL
2021 and end date is
01/01
SL
2022 and input message
let us provide data as
current fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be S
invalid date
select okay now the error message and uh
the data input message and the data
validation rule has been applied for
this column so let's try to enter some
date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20
22 it will not take this it will throw
error so that's how it works now let us
try to enter uh is
2021 and this is
March it will take it now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
balanced for all your employees so you
just want them to work between 9 to 5
and that should be fine and anything
apart from that time should be invalid
so you can do that by selecting uh time
option between it should be in between
and the start time will be
09 0 0 and this should
be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 9
a.m. to
okay 5
PM this should be the input message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be a log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us
provide the login time this should be
the right time and uh let's try to
provide wrong timings 08 now it will not
take it it will throw as error so it's
working fine let us provide 10 now let
us provide the log out time it should be
below 5:00 p.m. so let us provide 5 it
will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
1 minute less than
5 that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well
05 0 0 0
0 okay still there is some
problem okay we have entered for we
should we are supposed to enter 24hour
timing right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and soft software
testing team so what you can do is you
can provide a list so using that list
you can just uh H over to that cell
select the drop- down menu and inside
that you can select the option so we
will try to work something like that if
we have selected the entire
column selection
okay yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some cells without
data valid validation settings do you
want to extend data validation to the
sales
yes now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message select
one select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from drop
down
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option so you can
select developer for first one and for
second one you can select uh tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employed type names so the first one is
CEO second is developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employ
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here
let's expand
this okay now we have our uh list over
here now let us remove the data
validation from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
arase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to list
now here we can select the
source select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select one
from the menu or the drop
down copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided op
options you can scroll down and select
any one out of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system
analyist and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this
okay so we have deleted systems analyst
and when you click on the options here
you don't have systems analyst in that
place you have blank space right so
there is a way where all your U you know
data can be messed up so to avoid this
what you can do is you can actually um
save this data in a different sheet like
I did here like Department data you can
hide this sheet or you can protect this
sheet with password or something so that
nobody we can mess this up so now let us
get back to the employee data and select
this column and uh clear everything
press okay and let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah everything
okay now we have basically removed this
data from here now let us try to apply
the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's Pro
provide input
message data
options or Department options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide CEO
then we have
developer then we
have test so that's how you can protect
your how to protect and lock cells in
Excel now why do we need to lock or
protect cells in Excel let us imagine
that there is an Excel sheet with really
confidential data and you need to pass
that data to your subordinate or your
col to make some minor edits now let us
imagine that the edits are are supposed
to be done to only one or two columns
and rest of the columns should be left
as they are now there is a huge
possibility that sometimes unknowingly
or unwillingly there might be some edits
done by your colleague or your
subordinate So to avoid such kind of
unexpected mistakes you might want to
protect and lock yourselves that you
don't want your subordinate or your
colleague to edit so before we begin be
kind enough to get subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to stay updated on the
latest it Trends and Tech
content now without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is lock or protect cells in Excel
now let's get back into the Practical
mode and start our Microsoft Excel now
we are on the Microsoft Excel and this
particular spreadsheet is related to
employee
details yeah now the screen is visible a
bit better now let us imagine that this
is our confidential data and you want to
edit
only two columns that is the designation
column and phone number column now let
us imagine that the company has finished
one annual year and now there are some
promotions happening in the company and
let us also imagine that the phone
numbers of the employees provided by the
company have undergone some changes so
now the minor edits that you want to
make are related to the designation
column and phone number column now you
can see that all the columns that is the
blood group new salary salary rehke
current salary and name of the employee
serial number employee number everything
is editable so in such kind of scenarios
when you pass on this data there might
be a possibility where your colleague or
subordinate might end up making some
mistakes right so you want to avoid that
so you can do that by locking the celles
now let us rename this
sheet now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the
cells by the following
process so in this process you have two
major steps first one is to log the
cells and the next one is to protect the
cells by a password now when you select
all the cells in this particular sheet
you can just click on this edge here and
you have all the cells selected and now
right click somewhere on the sheet and
you can see an option called format
sales so in this particular option you
have some options Ed which is number
alignment font and you want to go into
the protection part so you can see by
default Excel keeps all the cells locked
now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns D and I and
now let's right click and go into format
Cs and in the protection option make
make sure that you uncheck the loged
icon now select okay and
now okay so you canot include the merged
cell fine we have a cell here which is
merged okay let's remove
that okay now again select the entire
column right click get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option
select
okay now we have finished the first part
that is locking all the cells which you
don't want to get edit and unlocking the
cells where you want to make some edits
now the second stage is protecting the
sheet now right click on the sheet name
and you can see an option called protect
sheet click that and now here you can
see select L cells and also select
unlock cells so let us provide a
password here so let us use some simple
password password so that we don't
forget that so I'll be selecting 1 2 3
and now select
okay reenter the password to proceed now
let us type 1 2 3 again now select okay
and now the sheet is
protected now we have successfully loged
and protected all the cells in Excel now
let us verify that the cells you wanted
to protect are really protected and
locked or not so we have unlocked phone
number and designation and everything
else is locked now let me try and edit
the blood group so when I double click
or try to edit this particular sheet
then I'll be receiving a warning from
Excel it says the cell or chart you're
trying to change is on a protected sheet
to make a change unprotect the sheet you
might be requested to enter a
password so it says that this particular
cell is locked and you cannot edit it
now let us try to edit the phone numbers
which we kept as unlocked
so you can see I can really edit the
unlocked cell here now let me try to
change this phone number let me enter
some random phone
number so you can see the cell is
editable now let us go through the
designation column and try to edit this
particular column now since I said that
there's a promotion happening in the
company so the deputy CEO is now the
current CEO of the company and software
develop happens to become the senior
software developer and the tester as
well let us imagine that he will become
the
senior and so on okay so this proves
that this particular sheet is editable
not the entire sheet but only the sense
that we kept in the unlock mode
okay now this is how you lock and
protect your sales in X you can see that
I have sales data on my worksheet so uh
let us imagine that your manager asked
you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottommost cell and you
know write it down as average
here okay average sales
so here this is a cell where you want to
keep your average right so here we'll be
writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your
company so to understand the p setup in
msxl we will go through a demo inventory
in Excel where we'll be considering some
restaurant data now without any delay
let's get started with the Practical
demo now we are on the Excel sheet and
this is the data I was talking about the
restaurant data where we have the First
Column that is Rank and next we have the
restaurant name followed by that we have
the sales happening through that
restaurant and then we have the segment
category that is what kind of service
does that particular restaurant offers
now this is the list what we made and uh
what if we wanted to represent this data
in the form of a printed paper right so
I guess you can see all the columns and
rows here so you can see that we have
almost like 250 rows so there is no
chance or there is no way to print all
those 250 rows in one page of course it
is practically possible but when you try
to read the content it'll be so tough to
read Because all the rows will be clued
together so closely so that you cannot
read it so uh you need to print them
Page by page so and you need to also
take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what page set up basically
means so we had a detailed overview of
our data and what actually we're trying
to make now let us see how page setup is
possible in msxl so to go to the page
setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
go to print menu by pressing a shortcut
method that is control P so you'll
directly end up on the page set set of
options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert draw page layout
formulas data review View and help so
the second method we can use page layout
option from the toolbar and you can see
when you click on the page option from
the toolbar you have a new ribbon over
here so this ribbon is all about page
setup options so it will offer you
margins it will offer you orientation
size print area brakes background print
tiles etc etc right so all these options
or menus in this ribbon belong to page
setup now let us look at the third
method so the third method is something
similar you have view option on the
toolbar so just select View and you can
see we have few page setup options over
here as well the normal page break page
layout custom views and we have grid
lines formula bar heading zoom in zoom
out select to zoom free certain panes
right so all these are also the page
setup options so we have the three
methods to enter the page setup options
now we are familiar with those now let's
get started with the Practical mode on
page setup for that let me use the
simplest method that is holding the
control key and pressing P which
navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scaling normal
margins letter portrait orientation
collated print active sheets and note
one for Windows you can see this option
is the printer's option for example if
you're connected to a printer which is
the hardware printer then your msxl will
show the printer's name here so so other
than printer you can also make some
other arrangements where you can just
directly print your complete data in the
form of PDF and then you can export your
PDF to your recipent that's also
possible okay now let's get started with
the first option that is print active
pages okay to understand this better we
need to create a new sheet not a problem
so you can see that we just have one
sheet over
here so let us kind of select all the
items and create a new sheet and try to
paste it over here or let's try to paste
it over
here okay now let's try to extend
this yeah this should be fine now let's
rename this sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as restaurant
sheet
two for our reference now let us get
back to the print sheet option so I'll
use the shortest method that is holding
the control key and press P now you can
see that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if we print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire
workbook right so now you can see that
there's a change in the number that is
12 pages so what is a workbook so
basically workbook is the collection of
entire sheets in your Excel homepage so
in this particular Excel homepage you
have the first sheet that is stop 250
and the second sheet that is the
restaurant sheet two right so the
combination of these two sheets make up
a
workbook so when you select the entire
workbook option you'll have 12 pages so
that's how we use this setting where you
select the active sheets the entire
workbook and there is another option
where you can only print a selected item
so if you want to do this then let's get
back here now what if your customer or
what if your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so you can select the
top 10
restaurants by doing
this now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
cated right so in collated you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 1 1 1 222 33 three so why
are these numbers present here and what
does collected mean anyway so this is
your question right now the answer for
this question will be a little similar
to your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invigilator and you have
10 students in your room so you wanted
to provide question papers to all the 10
students okay so you have your question
paper dis distributed into three sheets
that is you have marked questions and
your questions are fit into three papers
right in this scenario we have 250 rows
and all the data is split into six
sheets that is sheet one or page 1 page
two page three page 4 right now if we
wanted to print 10 copies then the
arrangement of papers will be page 1
page two page three page 4 page five
Page Six in continuous order right that
is CED if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that particular
approach is called uncollated approach
and if you're printing the pages in
continuous order for 10 times then that
particular approach which is called as
collated approach so this is what we had
to learn about collated and uncollated
now let's get back to the third option
now let's press again print now we have
our data over
here there's something
wrong select all the elements control P
yeah now we have our data back now we
have the third option that is the
portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
that we have two options that is
portrait and landscape so you might be
having a good idea like when you try to
click a picture in your phone we have
two modes as well that is portrait mode
and the landscape mode so when you click
on the portrait mode this is how your
data will be looking now to understand
the difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use the page page orientation for now
let's keep the page orientation as
portrait
orientation and we have now the fourth
option so what is the fourth option we
have various sets of options in here
that is letter and A4 size there are
also some more page options over here
where you can select the page types you
want to
print so basically you'll be having few
more options that is A4 A5 a A3 Etc but
here we just have two that is A4 and
letter so basically you'll get those
options and followed by that next we
have margins so here you can see we
don't have any margins for our data okay
so now we can add some margins by
setting up this one as an option like
last custom setting or you can also
choose normal wide narrow right so your
page will be changed according to your
margin
size right so this is how you can change
the margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling
option so here you can see we are trying
to fit the page so when you're trying to
print these sheets using no scaling then
the actual size of the page will be
printed now you can also modify that you
can fit and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print now if you
wanted to print the all the six pages
into the PDF format and mail it to your
client you can also do that I think I
have explained it in the first place so
you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one
[Music]
copy now let's print
this now let us select
the location
rename it and
publish now let's get back to documents
and see if the page is printed or
not here you go here we have the restant
data in the form of
PDF so we have our entire six pages of
data in the PDF format
now we are back on the homepage now we
had some limited functions in the print
function over here we had try to export
the data so you can also export the data
or try to print it from the print option
over here you can just select that as
well make a
file
PDF yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
to PDF
[Music]
data so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose the print option now when
you see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the page layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrait and
landscape now you can see the size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive
A3 right we have A5 and many more other
options and if you want some more paper
options you can go to more and you can
always select a few more options that's
how you do it and yeah we didn't had the
break option
so remember when we had been through the
print option we did not have the break
option there let's select this to normal
A4 so you cannot see the break option
over here right so here we have the
break option so what does break option
does right you can actually break the
page uh remember we spoke about the top
10 things or the top 10 rows you can
always do that so you can just keep the
top 10 restaurants in your first page
and then break the remaining and to set
page breaks you you can select the cell
now I need the top 10 so I'll select
this particular cell which is in the
11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of a page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting contrl P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first top 10 restaurant
printed on our sheets so that's how you
use the page
break now let's try to eliminate all the
page breaks so you can select braks and
reset all page breaks so the page break
has been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this one
so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then we can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible yeah
that's how you do it now if you don't
want the image to be added on your file
you can also remove that delete page
background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print titles
now why do we need print titles for that
let's try to print this so now you can
see the first page in the first page we
have the title rank restaurant sales
segment category but if you go to the
second page you don't have that title
right you don't have the title rank name
of the restaurant sales and their
service category so if we want that then
we need to add titles now for that let's
select the print titles option now let's
select the row to repeat on top now for
that we need the first row select the
first row and this particular row will
be repeating into all the pages now
let's try to print it so yeah now you
can see the titles are being added to
all the sheets you can see the page two
page three page four page five and page
six so you can see the titles added to
all the sheets now we are on the
spreadsheet so here what exactly are
page braks so page brakes are something
which help you during your trying to
print your data or present your data in
the form of a web page right in those
times you cannot fit your entire Excel
data in one spreadsheet or one paper or
one web page right so in those scenarios
Excel will try to eliminate a few parts
of your spreadsheet or it will try to
split the spreadsheet so how exactly it
looks like so go to the view option and
click on The View and click on page
break review here you can see the dotted
lines right so these are the things
which separate your data in form of
pages so that it can be printable on one
single page so some of the times the
user or the xuser manually inserts a
page break right so how do you insert it
just go to the page layout and here you
can see the page breaks insert a page
break and you have successfully inserted
a page break again go to the view go to
page break View and here you can see the
solid line so these solid ones are the
ones which are inserted by the users or
anyone who had the access to the data
now how do we eliminate them right so we
can eliminate them and we can try to you
know get the shade back to the normal
way so all you have to do is click on
the cell which has the page break which
is right under the page break go to the
insert page break yeah page layout menu
go to the brakes option click on remove
page break and there you go you have
successfully eliminated the page break
and page break preview to make sure that
the page break has been successfully
removed so you cannot see that anymore
so that's how you try to insert or
eliminate a page break in Excel so
conditional formatting is a method to
visualize your work sheeet we already
have the charts in Excel to visualize
our Excel sheets in graphical form but
what if you had to see or visualize the
data in your worksheet as it is so that
is where the conditional formatting
comes handy now let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel and try to implement
some conditional formatting now we are
on the Excel worksheet this particular
data set is based on a store now we have
various columns in this particular data
set we have row ID order ID customer
name Etc and finally we have quantity
discount and profits now let's let go to
profits uh let us imagine that we have
provided this particular store with a
target of minimum 15% profits now let us
find out the stores that have hit the
15% Target and the ones which did not so
for that let us select the entire column
now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home tool bar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the condition formatting
option click on that and you have
various options open over here
highlighting the cells top bottom rules
data bars data scales and icons so data
bars are actually the bar graphs which
highlight themselves on each and every
cell if you implement them and these are
the color scales if you want to
implement some colors you can go through
that and if you want to represent your
sales with icons you can also do that
for now let's highlight the sales so
select that and inside this select the
greater than option and here you can
provide the person percentage that is
15% and the sales or the stores which
hit the target should be highlighted
with green color and select okay and
there you go you have your stores that
hit the 15% Target and the ones which
did not hit the 15% Target now if we
want to highlight the ones which did not
hit the 15% Target you can highlight
them with the color
red
so conditional formatting
highlight the Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use this column
and conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the icons
now we have the icons over here the X
indicates that they're not alive and the
Green Tech Mark indicates that they're
alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel Excel
now here on my spreadsheet you can see
some data so this particular data has
some color markings so we have used
color codes to Mark the designations of
all the employees with different colors
so for example blue for manager purple
for senior and so on right now our duty
is to count the total number of emplo
chice present in a company based on the
color code this can be done using
filters but let's try with color codes
now we don't have a rily available
function in Excel to count cells based
on their colors but we can make use of
macro now to make use of macro you might
want to enable the developer options so
by default these will be disabled in
Excel to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see developer options so
make sure the checkbox is clicked to
enable developer options and press on
okay to completely enable developer
window right now when you click on
developer options you can see various
options here visual Basics macro Etc now
click on the macro to create a macro now
just give a name to the macro function
so I'll give simply
long and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored CS which we will be using in our
current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try to make use of it in
the spreadsheet so the function name is
Count colored cells as you can see and
this particular function will have two
parameters current cell and spreadsheet
area so the current cell will be the
cell address where the color you want to
count is present and then the
spreadsheet area so what is the range of
cells where you want to locate that
particular color and count the number of
reputations that is the spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used
colored cell range color code and color
cell count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the inter interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equals to the
current cell's color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equal = to +
1 initially by default it will be zero
in case if this particular if condition
is true that is the current cell color
and the color code given is equals to
same then the value of colored cell will
increase by one and this particular if
Loop will run as many number of times
the condition is true so let us imagine
that the condition will remain true for
five times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet and once
the condition fails then the latest
value present in color cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how the macro
function works now let's close the macro
window and get back to our spreadsheet
now let us try to make use of the macro
function that we just created so that is
equals to count colored cells press tab
to select the macro function and the
first one is the current cell so this is
the current cell where the the current
color is being provided comma the cell
range so our cell range will be from C2
to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six repetition of sky blue color in this
particular range of cells now you can
drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be
providing the results of the same so six
senior colors that is pink or purple
color then two repetition of this
particular color two repetition of
trainy color five for dark blue and six
for green right so this is how the macro
function works and the key point to
remember here is this particular macro
will work only for manually colored
cells so there are situations where we
have used conditional formatting to
color a single cell let us imagine that
we have used conditional formatting to
rec recognize the employees with salary
above 30,000 as green color and if we
try to use that particular green color
to be counted by the color count sales
function no it will not happen it will
not consider that color as a feedback or
an input now in future we will also try
to design a macro which can recognize
the colors made by conditional
formatting as well but this particular
function will be exclusively used for
manually colored cells only dated IF
function is majorly used to find the
difference between two individual dates
so it is also called as dated if by a
few people and a few people also
reference it to date diff that is date
difference so anything is good now to
find the difference between any two
dates let's select a few dates so the
first date would be uh let us imagine
that you're an employee and you wanted
to find out how many years that you've
been working with an organization so for
that you might want to need today and
the date where you join the company
right so it might be date of joining and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you join the
organization somewhere around
2010
01
05
2010 and today so for today can you can
give any particular
date let us imagine that uh today is 1st
of January 2021 or
2022 now we have up both the dates that
is the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the
date can be anything so you might be
watching this on a different date as
well so the date of that day for today
would be a little different so we'll
imagine the today's State as an
imaginary date now we might want to find
the difference that is in terms of years
so you wanted to find the difference in
terms of ears so here you can find the
difference in terms of ear days and
months as well so currently let's try to
find out the difference in terms of
years so for years you might want to
specify the third parameter in the data
function as why if you wanted months you
have to give the M as the third
parameter and if you want to define the
days you might want to give d as the
third parameter uh so we have discussed
the third parameter so what are the
first two parameters right so the first
two parameters are the first date and
the last date so the first date in this
situation is your date of joining and
the last date or the final date which
you want here as your today so let's
find the difference so for that equals
to so it can be dated F or date
diff so date if and
the first date which is the A2 and comma
the last date that is B2 and your
parameter third parameter in terms of
ears that is why close the bracket and
press enter so there you go you have
your date here so it's been like 11
years that you're working with your
organization so that's how you find out
the differences so we have 11 years
because uh we did not finish the 12th
year completely so if we had given the
month as uh maybe six where we have
finished our total years then it will
automatically change to 12 years
so now for this particular task we will
be considering the student database now
let's get into practical mode and start
our Excel so on my screen you can see
some data related to students now let us
try to duplicate some of the rows here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11 now we shall copy them and paste in
so now these are the duplicate elements
right now there might be possibilities
about the duplication of class because
all the students all the 10 students are
in same class so there might be a
duplication but we are not looking for
such kind of duplications right we are
looking for the duplication of the
entire row for example we have the
details of mic over here in the eighth
row which has the role number or serial
number as seven name as mic role number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eighth row is been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're going to
deal with we're going to eliminate the
duplicate rowes all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remove duplicates of option in
the ribbon so select all the data select
remove duplicates and now you can see
that we have all our uh column names
over here and make sure that you have
selected my data as headers and then
select okay and now you can see that
Excel has automatically removed four
duplicate values so four duplicate
values are found and removed 10 unique
values remain now another type of uh
remove duplicate GES can also be done so
you can see that here we have another
data set which has phone numbers or
phone names that is phone makers that is
Samsung Huawei Vio Oppo Etc so there are
some duplicate values in this I've copy
pasted them so now you can also do that
so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
highlight cell rules and inside that you
have duplicate values selecting this
option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated so that's how you you delete
or eliminate duplicate values in uh data
set and you can also see that we have
another duplicate in this particular row
and if you wanted to select a particular
row and eliminate the duplicates you can
also do that now for that you need to go
to the same process remove duplicates
and here Microsoft Excel is asking you
if you had to expand the selection to
the entire data set or you want to
continue with the selected data set as
or selected column itself so for that
you need to select the continue with the
current selection and remove duplicates
and press okay and you can see one
duplicate value was found and it has
been removed and six unique values
remain so that's how you use the
function of removing duplicates in Excel
so what is Su in Excel now you might
want to calculate uh the total sum of
sales right so let us assume that this
is your entire store sales data and you
wanted to calculate the entire sum of
sales so there is a sum function in
Excel where you just have to you know
select all the sales and apply some
function onto it and you'll get the sum
of all the sales right so with something
like this you'll select all the cells
and then you'll apply a sums function
and you'll get the sum here and average
everything right so this is fine but
what if you just wanted to find the
sales that are happening in only western
region as you can see our column f is
based on region so we have four regions
South West East and Central so your
manager asks you to find the sales
happening in suppose say west region so
how do you calculate it would you
manually go into each cell and check if
it's West and calc that will be time
consuming right so what if you had a
method which could do it for you just in
a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly summs so it will
basically add add a condition calculate
the sum of sales where the region is
equals to West simple to like or similar
to seal query right so that is exactly
what we're going to do in Excel today
that is using summs now let me add here
Sales of West Region now in the next
cell let's add a sumus function remember
there are multiple sum functions in
Excel so when you type in suum you can
see so many options based on some right
you just have some followed by that you
have some if it is just some if not some
if today we are concentrating on some
ifs so not just some if we'll go to some
ifs so we'll be having an option of
placing multiple if conditions there so
let's also try that more on that later
now let's press tab to select our sum
ifs function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sufs
we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks table but
right now it's not in tabula format it
is in the format of database we know
that Microsoft Excel considers its data
as a database by default so to convert
the database into table just click
anywhere on the data and press control T
so that you'll have a new dialogue box
and it will ask if your table has
headers just make sure that you have
take in it our table does have headers
so select okay now our database has been
converted into a perfect table and it's
ready for applying sums function so now
you can see our database has been
successfully converted into our table
now let's begin with our Su ifs now
again remember we are using some ifs
here not some if or sum so select sum if
and press T and we have our sus function
now the first step which column are we
looking at what are we finding out right
which is a sum range what sum do you
want for now we need sum of sales so
select the sales column and we have a
simple key function here let's hold
control again press shift and hold shift
together so we're holding control and
shift key together and now we're
pressing lower Arrow key once yes the
entire sales column has been selected
comma Now where do you want to look so
we want to look I mean which part of the
table you want to fetch right so this is
the region part we want to fetch right
now so and hold control and shift
together lower Arrow key the entire
column is selected now the next last
part so we want to look into the both of
the columns that is sales column and
region column now which type of data you
want so for now we want Western type of
data that is the sales data which is
happening only in vest right so we'll
select this cell with the data as first
or you can also manually enter it for
now let's select the data so I'm
selecting the cell f which has data as
West right now let's close the
parenthesis and press enter so there you
go you have the sales happening in the
western region now you can also try to
format it in the form of currency so
let's use uh dollars since it is based
on American states so let's use dollars
so there you go now we are having the
sales state of West now let's try to
copy the same to all the four cells and
uh now here let's start type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening in West and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay a fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy the cell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another input here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
so it is expecting that you are looking
for for adding another criteria right
now which column you want you want
category so let's select category you
want to select all the cells same track
control shift lower key and again press
comma and you want it to select only uh
Furniture so select on furniture cell
there you go now press enter so there
you go we successfully have the sales
data from west region based on category
Only Furniture so that's how you do sum
of Excel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sums function in the same way
all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use Su in Excel now creating a
pivot table is just a way from a few
clicks trust me it is just a couple of
clicks and you'll have your pivot table
ready to operate now click any cell or
select any cell on your spreadsheet
which has the data and navigate to
insert menu on the toolbar and select
pivot table and that's how simple it is
now automatically Excel will choose your
data you can see the lines over here
dotted lines that means the Excel has
already selected the range of data that
you want to put into your pivot table
and you can either select the the
existing worksheet or a new worksheet
I'll select a new worksheet over here
and just press on okay and there you go
you have your pivot table ready now here
you can see your pivot table is a little
empty all you need to do is drag and
drop the data elements that you want on
your pivot table so here you can see on
our spreadsheet we have some business
data related to a stop which has
furniture and states and sub categories
of the furniture and all the you know in
in category you have furniture office
supplies technology Etc right so those
have some subcategories as well and
different states and the regions as well
and the quantity total sales happen
right so using this business data we can
find out some key insights of this
particular data using our pivot table
right so here we'll add the data now let
me drag the region into rows click and
drag and let me
drag uh categories into columns which
are the different categories which are
involved in the sales data and values
what are the sales happened right and
there you go you have Furnitures office
supplies technology as the three
different categories and those are the
sales happened in central East South and
West regions and this is the grand total
and instead of regions you know you have
all the regions over here right so
Central east south west or instead of uh
all the regions or instead of all the
categories you can you know place a
specific category in your pivot table
for example let me push the category
into the filters and here you can see
the total sales happened in those
particular regions now what if someone
asks you to find the sales of Only
Furniture right so your manager comes to
you and he'll ask you getting the sales
of Only Furniture you can select that
and there you go you have the furniture
sales in all the regions right or you
can also do the vice versa
he can also drag uh regions into the
filters and if you wanted to find out
the region wise sales of furniture you
can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the priv table works and
you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filter or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have U
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategories into
the
columns right
and and you have the region y
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
in those particular you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also improve the
level of detail using pivot tables
in now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from 1
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be doing it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one two and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as long as you drag this logo
or that ending part where you have a
small square box that will fill all the
numbers until where you have draged it
so that's how autofill works and you
might be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that cell and the result
is it'll copy the same number all the
time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the next type so let
us imagine now the next type of series
you want to add is weeks in a day right
so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of weekday using
autofill and Excel as well so drag that
cell and it will give you all the days
or week days in a week now let's try
January and this will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut TOA right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current
year right it will now give you all the
dates of that current month or until the
end of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January so how can
you do that it's simple all you need to
do is select the cell go to the fill
option select series and here select
column wise since you w the dates and
columns and here in the type select date
date unit should be weekday and the stop
value should be the next month right
since your manager asked for the week
days of January so your stop value will
be the 1st of February press okay and
there you go so since the 1st of January
is Friday let select over here and the
rest two Saturday and Sunday are
eliminated similarly we have all the
dates here of working days only so
that's how you use AutoFill in Exel so
on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet so we will be
calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward a
few simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of
cells close the bracket press enter so
you have the sum
now so we have to calculate it repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing 47
by 500 and then we will be multiplying
that into 100 so that's how we calculate
the percentage
so cell G2 divided by cell H2 press
enter and you will end up with you know
uh the decimal format that's where
perfectly all right now we have also
extended the same formula for all our
cells now select this overall column or
select the highlighted cells right and
get into the data type here you have
General so that's why we have got that
uh decimal format but when you press
percentage you'll have the actual
percentage of all the students according
to their marks achieved now we are on
our Excel spreadsheet and this
spreadsheet has some values of employees
that is their employee ID name
designation Department salary date of
birth and date of joining now our
concern is to highlight some cells which
are duplicate in this or some rows which
are duplicate so for example here you
can see on row number seven we have the
details of Mara and you can see the same
details of Mara in the row number 14 as
well right so you need to eliminate
those cells or you need to eliminate
those rows now you can say there is a
quick way just few clicks and those will
be eliminated that is conditional
formatting yes that is also one way but
I'll show you what's the problem with
that okay so let us select the entire
table and get into conditional
formatting and here you have duplicate
values highlight cell rules with
duplicate values and there you go the
problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right so there there are certain
conditions or scenarios where you cannot
directly identify which is the duplicate
row again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced teque so let me cancel this and
for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as
duplicate
flag e flag
so the new column has been created which
is D flag so here we will be using a
simple formula that is Count F and here
press tab to select the formula and here
we will be adding our uh range that is
which range are you considering so the
range will be the employee ID since
employee IDs are unique for every every
employee
and and let's press function F4 to fix
it and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's track the same formula
to all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to
largest so now uh you can apply the
conditional formatting to highlighted
you can select the column H or the D
flag go to conditional formatting
highlight cell rules and here you can
get into greater than and give the value
as one okay so all the cells which are
you know repeated multiple times will be
selected here and they will be
highlighted with a selected color what
you have given so I've given Red so now
you can select these cells and highlight
them or delete them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean now
let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in tableu and those are the
pie chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pav chart and Spark
line charts so we will discuss one after
the other first let us discuss about the
pie chart so as you can see we have a
small data set on my screen which I have
personally created and uh this deals
with the companies and this deals with
the shares of the automobile industry so
now for this let's create a pie chart
select all the data and then get into
the toolbar and inside the toolbar you
can see various options and inside that
we going to use the insert option and
when you select the insert option you
will have a ribbon here and inside the
ribbon you can see groups tables
illustrations addin and here you go
these are the charts so now we needed a
pie chart so select on that icon and you
have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the three-dimensional pie chart as
it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be uh a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can directly explode this like
you can pick it out you can see this
right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a year so you can see
that the year has started from 2008 and
it has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so so since we
are dealing with column chat I'll tell
you the simplest way to create a column
chat there is a shortcut key for that
which is alt F1 and there you go you
have the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of years right you can see that
the first column is the es which is 2008
to 2021 but here you can see we have 1 2
3 4 which is not proper right so to
change the axis that is you can see the
axis which is 1 2 3 let me expand my
screen a little bit
Yeah so if you look at my screen we have
two different columns one column is
about the ear and the second column is
about the revenue now what we want to do
is we want to create a line graph where
we have ear on the x-axis and revenue on
the y- axis and we will be generating a
line graph based on the data we have now
for that we have to select the entire
data what we have then we need to go
into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chart
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option
select that and here you can see 2D line
graphs now let's select the first one
and there you go you have the line chart
here now let's rename the
title and there is one problem with the
chart here you can see that the x-axis
is not actually pointing the ears you
can make a change to that no worries
just right click and then you can see
the select data option and there you go
you have the edit option here just edit
it and now select the
range I am selecting the ears now let's
select okay and there you go you have
the ears here you can just try to expand
it a little
more yeah
so now you have the revenue on the Y AIS
and year on the x-axis and this shows
the growth of Revenue in your company so
this is how you create a l graph in
Excel
clar now let us imagine that you are the
CEO of an IT company and you have taken
up multiple projects let us imagine that
you wish to keep track of all the
projects so what if there was a tool
which could keep track of all the
projects in the form of a detailed
visualization with the percentage in the
form of a graph or a bar chart
interesting right that's exactly what we
going to design today using Microsoft
Excel so without further Ado let's get
started with our onepoint agenda that is
progress tracker in Excel now to design
a progress tracker in Excel let us get
back to the Practical mod mode where we
might have to use our Microsoft
Excel now we are on the Microsoft Excel
and we have taken some sample data to
make things look simple so here we're
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular data and design a
progress
tracker now let us try to increase the
size of the
cells now select all the celles in the
attendance call
column now we have selected all the
cells in the attendance column and in
the toolbar select the Home tab and
inside the Home tab you have styles
group inside the Styles group select
conditional formatting and inside the
conditional formatting option select new
rule so in the new rule we want to
select the first option that is format
all cells based on the
values now here here you can see format
style since we trying to create a
databas we need to select the option of
databas
here and under the data bar options we
have some more options on the drop- down
menu so here in the type select
number and the minimum number is zero it
is automatically stored here and and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as one now here we can
select the color for your pass now since
we have already chosen green for all the
column headers let's choose
blue
and select okay now here you can see
that the values are being indicated
using bar graphs right and you can also
see the percentage values but we can
make it look a little more better by
shifting them to the left side and text
could be given as white so that it's
more uh vibrant to look at and now we
can also apply some conditional
formatting onto these attendance columns
so let us try to highlight the students
having attendance less than
65% so highlight cell herul less than
65%
attendance with red color select okay
and there you go you have the progress
tracker right on your screen and using
the same principles you can track the
attendance for all the students and also
you can apply some conditional
formatting onto all your C and highlight
the ones which are not on the track now
this is how you can Implement progress
trackers using
Excel now for this particular example we
going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little
bit so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the second column is the
start dates of the employees that when
have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
worked in that particular organization
so to create a g chart is really simple
you just have to select the data and
then go to the insert option and in
there you can see the charts icon and
select all charts and in that select the
bar chart and here you can see the
Stacked bar chart select that and press
okay and there you go you have the
Stacked bar chart right on your screen
let's expand this a little more so that
we have the clear visualization of the
dates as well now you can if you want
you can change the title as or rgd data
or employe
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chart and series
values or let's select
this and select let's move a little
yeah so these are the data series let's
select okay and you can see the Gan chat
on my screen right here select okay and
it's done and still now it's not
complete yet so to finish it you need to
select the blue colored bars here and
right click on them and select format
data
series go go to the fill icon and select
no
fill and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse order
and there you go it should be done and
there you go you have your Gant chart
right on your screen Excel is a really
powerful tool for data analytics and
Reporting and pivot tables are one of
the features that Excel offers for
creating tabular reports to summarize
our data let's begin by understanding
what is a pavot
table a pavot table is a tool that
summarizes and reorganizer selected
columns and rows of data in a
spreadsheet to obtain a desired report
it does does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives pivot tables are specially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be time consuming to calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a pivot table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
display the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is a good time
for us to analyze India's last census
data from 2011 and see where different
states and cities across India stood in
terms of population literacy and other
socioeconomic factors we will analyze
this data by creating different pivot
tables in Excel and explore some of its
features so let's begin first I'll show
you one of the features that Excel
offers us so suppose I click on any cell
and hit control+ Q you can see our
entire table is selected and at the
right bottom there's an option of quick
analysis now you can see by default
Excel has prompted certain features such
as formatting we have charts totals and
there's one more called tables now Excel
by default has created some P tables for
us now the first one you say sum of
district code by state names next we
have sum of sex ratio by state name then
we have sum of child sex ratio some of
male graduates and some of female
graduates by state name and there are
others before creating our pivote table
so let's have a final look at our data
set so First Column you see is the city
column so there are different cities
from different parts of India then we
have the state code we have the state
name district code we have the total
population followed by male and female
population next you can see we have the
total literates from each City then we
have the male and female literates next
we have the sex ratio then we have the
child sex ratio next we have total
number of graduates and finally you can
see we have male and female graduates so
using this table we'll create several
peot
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the total population for each
of the states in descending order so to
create a peot table you can click any
cell in your data go to the insert Tab
and here left you can see we have the
option to create a pivote table so let
me select pivote table now my range is
already selected the entire table and
here I'll choose existing worksheet
because I want to place my pivote table
in the same worksheet and I'll give my
location I'll point to cell Q5 now let
me click
okay you can see the poot table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name on
rows so here in our P table you can see
we have the different state names listed
now we want the total population for
each of these states so in the field
list I'll search for total population
which is this one and drag it under
values you can see we have a sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I right click go to
sort option and choose Zed to a that is
largest to
smallest you can see here in 2011
Maharashtra had the highest number of
population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andra Pradesh and
and if I come down we have nagaland and
andman and nicobar Islands towards the
end so this is a simple poo table that
we created now the next problem we have
is we want to find the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so let's see how to do it
I'll click on any cell go to insert and
here I can click on pivote table my
range is selected I'll choose existing
worksheet and and give my location which
is Q5 I click on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all the
states next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then will City on two rows
you can see here we have our peot table
ready to the left of the pivote table
you can see we have the state names and
the cities per state and on the right
you can see the total number of
literates from each City if I scroll
down we have Assam then you can see we
have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
that's Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
Karnataka and other states as well
moving
on okay so the next thing we want to see
is what is the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state with that
we also want to find the states that had
the highest and lowest sex ratio in
2011 so let's create a poot table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average sex
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want to see it based on different
states so what I'll do is I'll take
state name and put it under rows so here
you can see we have our pivot table
ready on the left you can see we have
the different state names listed and on
the right we have the value values now
we want to find the average Now by
default Excel will sum the numeric
columns you can see it tells you sum of
sex ratio and child sex ratio so what
you can do can click on this drop down
and go to Value field
settings and here summarize values by
you can choose average you can see the
custom name it says average of six ratio
click on okay
our entire column is now giving us the
average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into average
I'll again click on the drop down go to
Value field settings click on average
and click
okay and you can see here we have the
average of child sex ratio for each of
the states now the next question says
which states had the highest and lowest
sex rate IO so we'll consider this
column so we'll sort it in any order you
want you can do it either ascending or
descending let me sort it in descending
order you can see we have our column
sorted
now so in
2011 Kerala had the highest sex ratio
and if I scroll down to the bottom you
can see himanchal Pradesh had the lowest
which is around 818
up next let's explore one more feature
of P table so suppose you want to see
the top or bottom few rows of a p table
you can do that as well so here we have
a question at hand we want to find the
top three cities with the highest number
of female graduates so let's see from
the entire pivote table how we can
filter the top three cities so I'll go
to insert click on the P table option go
to existing worksheet click on Q5
and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows and then we want the female
graduates so in the search bar I'll look
for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the
highest number of female graduates in
the top three cities so let me first
sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can say that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities but
it's displaying all the cities for us so
let's filter only the top three so what
you can do is right click and go to
filter and under filter you have the
option of top 10 I'll select this here I
only want the top three so either you
can go down like this or you can
directly type
three your column is already selected
let me just click on okay there you go
we have the required pivot table ready
and it only displays us the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a pivote
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and Karnataka so let's
create a p table for this and see how
you can use a slicer to filter the
table click on existing I'll click on a
location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values
and then I'll select the
city on to rows and then the state name
also I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the pivote table all the states
and their cities and on the right you
can see the total population for each of
these cities but our question is we want
to find only for Rajasthan and Karnataka
now for that what you can do do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option and
here you have the option to create or
insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll search for these
two so here we have Karnataka so let me
select Karnataka
first and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our pivot table we
only have data for Raj and
Karnataka so this pivote table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and similarly we also have for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do that I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty
cell okay now here since we want to find
the percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literates on two values
followed by female literat on two values
by default it has summed up the male
literat and female L value and also I
want to drag State
column to
rows so here you can see the sum of male
literates and female literates per state
I want to convert this as percentage
contribution so what we can do is I'll
select any cell and I'll right click and
I'll go to so value as and here I have
the option to select percentage of grand
total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male literates through
the total now if I sort this you will
get to know which state contributed or
has the highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
for male
literates then we had utar Pradesh in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and Andaman
and nicobar
Islands as two states which had little
or minimal contribution to male
literates similarly let's do it for
female literates I'll go to so value as
and select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature to convert your data and SE and
terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto rows and let's
drag the city column onto
rows next we want female graduates so
let me look for female graduates in the
field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and and to the
right of the P table you can see the sum
of female graduates from each
City now first I'll sort this column
I'll right click go to sort and click on
sest to largest now we have sorted our
female graduates
from sest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to the
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now
I'll replace top 10 with bottom and I
want the bottom three cities from each
state I have my column selected that is
some of female graduates if I click on
okay you can see here some of the states
don't have three cities so you can see
under man and nicobar islands has only
one city that is Port player while the
remaining you can find the bottom three
cities with the lowest number of female
graduates so Andra Pradesh had these
three in Assam we had Naga then there
was diar and ccha similarly if I come
down in harana we have palwal kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka this gangavati this Rani
benur and this scholar similarly you can
see for Kerala as well
now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a p table so in a p
table you can create or use custom
formulas to create calculated fields or
items calculated fields are formulas
that can refer to other fields in the
pivote table calculated Fields appear
with other value fields in the pivote
table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
some of followed by the field name so
here we have a sales table that has
columns like the items which has
different fruits and vegetables and
those have been categorized as fruits
and vegetables we have the price per kg
and this is in terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you can do that with the
help of a p table I'll create a p table
first click on an empty cell hit okay
now if you see on the top under P table
analyze and under calculations we have
the option Fields items and sets if I
click click on this drop- down I get the
option to create a calculated field or
insert a calculated field I click on
this I'll give my field name as sales
and I'll select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculated field that
is present in the pivote table fields
which is seals but it did not add it to
our original table or original table is
the same but here we have added a
calculated field which is present only
in the pivote table list now we can use
this it has already taken it under
values now let's say I want to find the
sum of sees for each item under each
category you can see it here we have our
category fruit and we have our category
vegetable and under that we have
different items like apple apricot
banana similarly in vegetables we have
broccoli the carrots corn eggplant and
others so this is how you can create a
calculated field in a pivote table now
this's one more good feature that Excel
offers us in pivote table is to create a
pivote chart so you can use your pivote
table and create different charts so
I'll show you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts I click on this Excel
gives me some default charts which you
can use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
Excel has created this is called a
pivote chart now here you can see the
category fruits and vegetables and the
different fruits and vegetables or the
items in the y axis you can see the
total seals if you see from the graph
guava meet the highest amount of Sals
now if I sort this
let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I sorted and changed my peot table
the poot chart also automatically gets
updated similarly there are other charts
also that you can create let's go to the
insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pie chart so this is a pie chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our PI chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the pi
that has the highest area represents it
had the highest amount of seals in this
case you can see it is guava and
similarly we have other items as well
this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivot table go
to insert and under recommended charts
let's now select a line chart if I hit
okay move it to the right so this is a
line chart you can see it starts from
guava which had the highest amount of
sales then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800 R and
our lowest was eggplant at 900 rupees
for fruits papaya sold the least at 700
rupees let's take another chart I'll go
to insert under recommended charts let's
see this time we'll see a bar chart now
this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
take the area chart for now so this is
an area chart again it looks similar to
the line chart it starts with guava
which had the highest amount of sees
similarly papaya under fruits had the
lowest amount of Sals under vegetables
it was broccoli and finally eggplant
meet the lowest amount of sales under
vegetable now let's go to our first
sheet and summarize what we have done in
this demo for pivot tables in Excel so
we had our
data this is a 2011 Census Data from
India we had the different cities the
state names and we had the total
population total literates female
literates male literates we had the sex
ratio total graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple pivote table
where we calculated the total population
for each state and sorted it in
descending order we found that
Maharashtra utar Pradesh had the total
population in
2011 then we saw another preot table
where we calculated the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical column so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex
ratio after that we saw how you could
find or filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater and bangaluru with the top
cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a poo table soow we sliced our table
based on Rajasthan and Karnataka State
and saw the total population for all the
cities in Rajasthan and
Karnataka in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates one thing
marked that some of the states did not
have three cities for example Andaman
had only one city that was Port player
but the others we found out the bottom
three cities that had the lowest female
graduates finally we looked at how to
create a calculated field in a pivote
table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called seals and then
we explored how to create different
charts and graphs so this was an area
chart that we saw is a column chart we
also saw or looked at a bar chart that
was a horizontal bar chart similarly we
saw how to create a pie chart as well so
how to create a PIV chart you ask it is
really simple all you need to do is just
follow few steps and you have your PIV
chart ready which is completely
interactive now all you have to do is
select any cell in the data set you have
and rush into the insert toolbar then in
the group of charts you have an option
called pivot chart select on it now
you'll be asked to select the data range
and you can see Excel has automatically
select all the range that you want to
include in your PIV chart then you have
another option which is asking you to
either create the PIV chart in the
current worksheet or for a new worksheet
for now let's select a new worksheet and
there you go voila the pivot chart is
completely ready you might ask me this
is completely empty yes the default
pivot chart what you get from Excel will
be completely empty but you can add the
Legends and all the data that you want
to add onto your pivot chart just by
dragging and dropping the data from the
right hand side of your Excel sheet that
is from the P chart Fields so you can
see we have various options region
category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular regions by dragging sales
into values now you have all the data in
the form of PIV chart which is
completely interactive which represents
the sales happening in those regions now
you can also select a particular region
right by default all the regions are
selected but if you want to select only
Central then you can do that by
deselecting everything and select only
Central and select okay and there you go
you have all the data related to the
sales happening in the central region
now if you want to you know kind of see
all the uh categories of sales happening
in all the regions you can drag the
category into values again and uh in the
region part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is old regions and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in Old regions at one single
go and I hope you did not observe it
clearly uh the XEL also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely
interactive now here we have four
different sheets of the sales so the
first sheet is the West Zone next is
South Zone East Zone and central zone so
all this data belongs to one single
sheet that is Superstore data set so I
have categorized or I have taken a part
of the data which belongs to central
region South Region west region and east
region now we are going to use all these
four sheets and create one single sheet
which is the pivot table of all the four
sheets now without further Ado let's
start the process now for that we might
want to use the shortcut key that is alt
D now press P now this starts the pivot
chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for you now click on next
now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have
South and finally we have
West now we will name these according to
the
regions so the first one will be West
next one will be
South next one will be
East and the last one will be
Central click on next and here select
new worksheet and finish
and there you go you have the pivot
table here now you might want to change
the submission value so click anywhere
on the pivot table and change it from
count to
sum so that you have the sumission of
the total number of sales subcategory
sales and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here can you can see
the furniture office supplies technology
and the grand total all in one single
sheet now let's get back to the original
sheet so as you can see this is the
original sheet and in the original sheet
you can see various more
categories which is the which is the
shipment mode customer customer segment
country City State uh and you also have
uh um product name subcategory Etc so if
you had added all these into this sheet
you can also create a separate option of
adding myu details to your pivot table
so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets mail merch
in Excel is a simple yet spectacular
method to write similar emails to
hundreds and thousands of recipients
without a hassle or even a single error
let us imagine that you are supposed to
write an interview call letter to multi
multiple recipients so what if you had
like five recipients you could do five
different emails and you could send them
but what if you had 50 or even 500 right
that would seem a little Troublesome and
you might even feel that you might want
a whole team to do that right but what
if I say that you can do the same with
one single mail within a matter of
minutes you send all the emails to all
the 50 or 500
cents sounds interesting right so now in
this particular tutorial we are going to
do the same now without further Ado
let's directly get onto the Practical
mode and start our Excel and try to do
some mail merch in
Excel now we are on practical mode and
we have started our Microsoft Excel so
regarding the example we discussed
earlier that is sending an interview
call letter to multiple people that's
what exactly this Excel sheet does so
here we have about 25 members or 25
candidates with their first name last
name and email and their address written
over now where is our call letter now
this happens to be our call letter so
the call letter is been sent from an
imaginary company that is smart
Solutions private limited India and
followed by that we are having one
recipient here who happens to be Mia and
the subject and everything all the text
related to the interview call now we are
trying to send this one one single
interview call letter to all the 25
people now the only change that is going
to happen is the recipient's name and
address is going to change and the
addressing for example here you can see
dear Mia so instead of dear Mia we're
going to greet the recipient with their
particular name so that's what we're
going to try to do now so to do that you
have to go into the toolbar and select
mail links option option in the mail
Lings option you can see the start mail
merch select recipients edit recipient
and all other options so here you might
want to select the second group and
inside the second group you have an
option called select recipients click on
that and now it will show you some
options the first one is Type in new
list so if you are having some list then
you can type in or if you already have
an existing list like what we did
creating an Excel sheet and storing all
the email and address and all the
recipients complete details you can use
that as well so here we're going to use
the existing list so click on
that now it will show you a new dialog
box using which you have to navigate to
the existing list so our existing list
is named as mail merch so click on that
and select
open now press
okay now the next next part is to
address all the details so here you can
see that two address and after that you
can see the addressing of the recipient
now we have to encode this mail in such
a way that to all the recipients
automatically Excel will replace the
addresses names and the greetings right
now let's try
that now let's try to encode the address
part so highlight the address part and
in the same mail links option you can
find the address block and write and
insert Fields
ribbon so let's select that and now you
can see the address of everyone
right so this is the preview of the
recipient's address now you can see that
the recipient's full name and state is
only available here not the street and
house number Etc now you can fix that by
selecting the match Fields option and
here you can include the address so
which might be the house department and
the second one would be Street and U
postal code you can match it with PIN
code and that's all yeah remaining we
have everything else let's look at the
preview and this is how it looks like
perfect now let's select
okay that's
fine and uh similarly we will also try
to match
the just a moment yeah similarly we'll
try to encode the recipient's name now
for that let's go into the greetings
line here you can see you can select the
option Dear Sir or dear ma'am or to
whomever may may concern and uh here you
have another option two or just deer so
we'll go with deer and this is how the
preview looks like and if you're happy
with that it's okay and if you want to
Pary check for other things I mean other
recipients you can also do that for
example the next recipient is Santos
shastri and followed by him we have
prakar Redi rajes sahu right you can
also check check everything and here you
can also see the address changing on the
mail so you can check for jagadish
charari his address and his name right
so it looks like it's working perfectly
now select okay and that's
done now we are in the final stage and
in the mailings option you can see the
last two options that is the preview
results and finish so before merging and
finishing the mail merge we shall go
through a quick preview to check if
everything is fine or not so here you
can see we have the address block this
is how the encoding looks like and uh if
you replace the encoding with the actual
address and name this is how the actual
address and name look like and you can
check all the letters you can just click
on the Arrow key here and you can check
all the recipients address and their uh
names right so if you can find any
errors you can replace them and if not
if everything isine fine then you can
just quickly press on the finish and
merge option when you finish merge
option or finish and merge option you
get three different options that is edit
individual documents print documents and
send all these to the recipients now if
you had any queries or if you had any
doubts about or if you find any errors
on the mails then you can go to that
particular individual document and edit
it with the first option and in the
second option you can print all the
documents like if you want to send a
hard copy then you can print it so you
can see here all and select okay and
then you can you know kind of save it as
a PDF or you can send the location of
your printer and then just press
okay right you can just save them in the
form of
PDF or you can directly send the emails
right now I'm not connected to any
printer so I'm not going to print any
documents now let us try the last one
this should be
interesting now when you select the mail
option then it automatically selects the
email column from your Excel sheet
remember we had an email column from
Excel sheet right this particular column
word automatically selects that column
from Excel and you can just select okay
and all the mails will be sent to all
these imaginary mailing addresses
so that's how it's done what is Excel
vlookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same row vup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user enters now let's look at the syntax
to write a V lookup function so V lookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the v look of
function so the first argument is called
the look of value the look of value
represents the value that you're
searching for next is the table array
the table array represents two or more
Columns of information the third
argument is called the column index
number now this represents the column
number in the table from which the value
must be returned the First Column is 1
the second column is two and so on and
then we have the fourth parameter which
is called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you need to
enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo so for our demonstration we'll use
a sales data set you can see the data
set on the left using this data set
we'll understand how V lookup performs
an exact and approximate match we'll see
how V lookup is case
insensitive then we'll perform a wild
card character search we'll understand
how to handle error when a match is not
found and finally you will look at
two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how V lookup works so we want to find
the unit sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left so here you can see I
have the data set it has some rows and
columns so these are the columns which
are order date region there's a
representative column item units there's
unit cost and total and from this table
I want to find the units that were sold
by Morgan if you look at the table at
the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan and Morgan
has sold 30 units now I want to find
this value using the V lookup function
so here on the right you can see I have
my lookup value which is Morgan and this
is my V lookup formula and using this
formula I'm getting the result as 30 now
let's go to our Excel workbook can
perform all the demos one by one so this
is my Excel workbook that we are going
to use for our demo and here is the data
set we'll be using now this is the same
data set that you saw a while ago so
this data set has seven columns you have
the order date the region
Representatives name item there's units
unit cost and total which is basically
the total or the amount of sales that
was
generated we are going to use a chunk of
this data set and perform our vlookup
analysis so let's see our first example
and the problem we have at hand let me
go to the exact match tab all right so
here I'm going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first 11 rows from the data set you can
see from row
two till row 12 is going to be our data
set that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thompson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that he sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my vlookup function so let's go
ahead and write our vup
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my V lookup formula to write the V
lookup formula I'll write first equal to
and I'll write V lookup if I hit tab it
will auto complete all right now let's
give the parameters so first is going to
be the lookup value which is nothing but
Thompson so I'll just select this cell
which is
j17 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the first column of a table and you can
select the table array till the end of
the data set or till the column which
has the value you want to find so here
I'll select my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the item column which is going to be
my table array then I'll select the
column index number so the column index
number is based on the table array you
have selected in this case my column
index number is going to be two because
we have selected just two columns and
the value which I'm going to find is in
the second column so I'll give two comma
Now the range lookup I'm going to give
is false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson had sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil all right now let's try
to change the table array and see what
result are we getting so this time I'll
slightly change the table array so again
we are trying to find the item that
Thompson had sold so write my formula
equal to V lookup I'll hit tab to
autocomplete I'll give my lookup value
as Thomson comma this time I'm choosing
my table array starting from the
representatives column till the end of
the data set which is till
p12 again my column index number is
going to be two because if you consider
this table array the item column is the
second column in the selected table
array so I'm going to write it as 2
comma
the range lookup I want to give as false
because I want to find the exact match
if I close this and hit enter you can
see it has return return me the same
result that we saw earlier now suppose
let's say this time I want to start my
table array from the region column which
is this column so I want to select my
table array starting from the region
column now this is going to show me an
error because your table array should
always start from the lookup value
column so if you consider Thompson as
the lookup value my table array should
always start from the representatives
column so let's just try this example so
I'll write V lookup my lookup value I'm
going to give it as Thompson comma the
table array as I mentioned earlier I'm
going to choose from the region column
and let's say I'll select till the item
column give another comma and this time
my column index number is going to be
three because since the T array has
three columns and my item column is the
last column so I'm going to give my
column index number is three comma I
want to get the exact match so I'll give
zero if I close the bracket and hit
enter you can see it has given me an
error okay now let me just show you
another method to use vlookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under function Library you see we have
have an option to select look up and
reference if I click on this and if I
scroll down below you can see there's an
option called V lookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range lookup under
this function arguments dialog box so
here I want to select my lookup value as
Thompson my table array is going to be
from the representatives column till
let's say the end of the data set my
column index number is going to be
two I'll write two and range lookup I'll
write as false because I want the exact
match if I hit okay you can see it has
given us the exact same result so this
is one of the other ways to use V lookup
in Excel now let's move to the next
sheet which is is regarding approximate
match okay so sometimes you might have
cases where you don't have the lookup
value present in the table in those
cases you can tell V lookup to return an
approximate match now one thing to keep
in mind is that your lookup value column
should always be sorted in ascending
order while trying to get an approximate
match so here we are going to use this
table and my lookup value column which
is going to be the representatives
column is already sorted in ascending
order
and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be Matt now if you see
this table I don't have the
representatives name Matt anywhere in
the table now using an approximate match
I want to find the item and the unit
cost so let's do it so here under item
I'll write my V lookup formula so I'll
type vlookup I'll hit tab to complete it
it and this time my look of value is
going to be mat so I'll select this cell
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of item column because I want to find
the item value for mat I'll give a comma
my column index number as per the table
array is going to be two comma my range
lookup this time I'm going to give us
true or one so I'll write one close the
bracket hit enter all right it has
returned me binder was the item sold by
Matt now let's try to figure out why we
look up returned binder as the
item now let's see you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should Place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Kel so in an approximate match
V lookup will consider the previous
highest value in this case the previous
highest value before Matt is KL and
hence we lookup returned the
corresponding item purchased by Kel
which is binder now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for
Matt again we lookup will return the
unit cost of KL which is 120 5 let's
just try it out so I'll write V lookup
my lookup value is mat comma my table
array for this time is going to be from
Representatives column till the unit
cost column I'll consider I'll give a
comma Now the column index number as per
the table array is going to be four I'll
give another comma and this time I'll
double click true because I want an
approximate match if I close the bracket
hit enter
you can see it has returned me 125 which
is actually kl's unit cost okay we have
another question and this time I want to
find the units sold by Rob now Rob is
going to be my lookup value if you see
the representatives column we don't have
Rob now let's see what we lookup is
going to return as the item for Rob so
I'll write V lookup I'll give my lookup
value as Rob comma
my table array is going to start from
the representatives column I'll select
till here I'll give a comma the column
index number is two give another comma
I'll double click on
true so I close the bracket hit enter
you can see vup has return me pen now
let's understand why V lookup returned
pen for Rob now if you are asked to
insert the representatives name Rob into
into this column so ideally Rob would
appear somewhere between Morgan and
sorino because since this is sorted in
ascending order Rob is actually greater
than Morgan and is less than sorino so
as you know we look up in an approximate
match Returns the previous highest value
which is Morgan here and the
corresponding item for Morgan is pen and
hence we look up returned pen for Rob
all right now moving to the next
sheet which is another property of
vlookup which tells V lookup always
looks to the right this means that your
lookup value must always be on the left
and the value you are going to find out
should always be to the right of the
table now consider this scenario where
your lookup value is on the left in this
case it is the representatives value and
I have taken svino for an example and we
want to find the order date for svino
now if you consider this table your
lookup value which is svino is actually
this column the representatives column
and we are going to find out the order
date so your representatives name is on
the right of the table and the value we
are going to find out is on the left of
the table now as per the property we
look up only looks to the right so if I
use the vlookup function for this
example here I'll write vlookup I'll
I'll give my lookup value as svino comma
my table array I'll consider from the
order date because I want the order date
till the representatives column I'll
give a comma and this time my column
index number is actually the first
column if I consider my table array as
the first three columns
selected and my range lookup is going to
be false if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me an error the reason
is we lookup always looks to the right
and this time the value we were trying
to find out was to the left of the
table now if you consider the opposite
case suppose you have the order date and
you want to find the representatives
name you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write vook up my lookup value
is going to be sorvino's order date so
I'll select it from the table I'll give
a comma my table array will start from
the G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number will be three if you consider
these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got svino corresponding to the order
date
all right now let's move to the next
tab now this tab says vook up returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by
Jardine if you see this table we have
the representatives name Jardin twice
you see here and if you look down we
have jardan here as well but the item
sold by jardan at the first instance is
pencil and at the second instance it's
desk now as per the property V lookup
always returns the first match now
ideally when we write the vup function
and look for the units sold by Jardine
you will see vup will return 36 instead
of 3 Let's just write
out I'll write the vooka
function my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the table
array is three I'll give another comma
Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter now as you can see it returns me
the first match of Jardine which is 36
so we look up did not consider the
second
match now
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here we have Jones here for the
second time and also we have Jones for
the third time and let's say you want to
find the unit cost for Jones so if I
write the vooka
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range lookup is zero if I
click on this and hit enter you can see
it here V lookup has returned the first
instance of Jones and it did not
consider the second and the third
instance so our unit cost for Jones is
1.99
because we lookup only Returns the first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is V lookup is case
insensitive if you consider this table
I've added another row in green so if
you see here I have a representative
name called Gil which is in proper case
or popularly known as sentence Keys here
I have added Gil's name
in capital letters or all in upper case
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is Gil which is
actually in upper case I'll consider my
table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the sales
column based on this selection my column
index number is five
comma the range lookup is false so I'll
just double click on
false I close the bracket hit enter you
can see it here our vook of function has
returned the total as
53973 which is actually the value for
this row so clearly V look up did not
consider Gil which was present at the
bottom of the table in upper case so
this shows that V lookup is clearly case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the vooka function supports
wild cards which makes it possible to
perform a partial match on a lookup
value for instance you can use vlookup
to retrieve values from a table after
typing only part of a lookup value to
use wild cards with v lookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for the last argument that is
range lookup now we have a question here
I want to know how much sales did the
representative whose name starts with Ki
make now here sales represents the total
column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if you consider the representative
column I have one representative whose
name starts with Ki that is Kel so using
Ki as my lookup value I want to find the
total so so let me show you how to use
wildcard characters and find the value
using V lookup so I'll write my function
V
lookup okay now in lookup value I'll
give
Ki after that I'm going to write Amber
scent followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star and close the inverted
comma this means the value starts with
Ki Amber scent actually represents
concatenation and star represents
anything followed by Ki so this is going
to be my lookup value in total I'll give
a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of total column because I
want to find the Sals I'll give another
comma my column index number based on
the table array we have selected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match it close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
999.50 which is actually qals
total now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I can directly
write it in the vooka function so I'll
write the VCA function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value So within double
inverted commas I'm writing Ki followed
by Amber sent which is for concatenation
followed
by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my look of values
this in total means anything that
appears after Ki will be considered as
the lookup
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number would be five comma
the range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you see we have the
same value so this is another method or
another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the vlookup function cannot not find a
match it returns a hash na error now if
you want you can use the if na function
to replace the hash na error with a
friendly message so suppose you want to
find the region in which an order was
placed on 10th of May
2018 now if the order date is not found
I want to return a message that is
invalid date
so if you look at the order date column
we don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my vlookup function cannot
find this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write
this I'll type my vook of function I'll
give my order date as 10th of May
2015 as my lookup value and then I'll
consider my table array starting from
the order date column till the end of
region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table array we have
selected comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do it I'll do it here so to
return a valid
message I'll use the if any function and
within if any function I'll give my V
lookup function so let me type if
na I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my V lookup function so my lookup value
is going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes since it is a
text
message I close the bracket hit enter
you can see the result which is invalid
date
now moving on to the final section of
the demo we have two-way
lookup now in the v lookup function the
column index parameter is normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using the match function to locate
the right
column and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and columns now let me
first show you how a match function
works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my match type as zero for
exact match if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me four because my
array was selected from the
representatives column till the unit
cost column and in this array unit cost
is at the fourth index all right now
using this idea let's solve the
following problem I want to find the
cost of each item sold by Morgan so
let's write our V lookup
formula write
bookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the
Representatives name as Morgan comma my
table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit code cost
comma my lookup array is from C1 till
fub1 comma my match type is zero I close
this bracket give another comma and I'll
give my range look up as zero close the
bracket hit enter you can see for Morgan
the unit cost is 19.99 you can verify
from the table for Morgan the unit cost
is
19.99 all right now
we have another question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrews make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here okay so let me just paste the table
here all right now I'll create another
column where I'll merge the values of
region and representatives so here let
me create another column okay I'll just
name this column as
region
rep all right now this
column I'll use the concatenation
operator so I'll Select East use Amber
sent and then select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the total I'll write
my vlookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
j11 Amber
Cent k 11 comma while table array will
start from the region rep which has the
values of region and rep combined
till the last
column and from this table array my
column index number is five and my range
lookup is zero if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see for central region
which is this one and for Andrew's
representative the total is 149.
25 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did in this demo okay so first of
all we saw our data set which was AES
data set that we used then we started
with our first example to see how vooka
performs an exact match we also saw how
using the formulas Tab and lookup and
reference you can WR WR V lookup in
another way so you can use the function
arguments to give your V lookup
parameters next we saw how WEA performs
an approximate match so we had Matt and
raw which were not present in the
representatives column after that we saw
an important property of V lookup that
is V lookup only looks to the right
followed by V lookup only Returns the
first match following which we saw that
V lookup is case insensitive so here we
had added a new row where Gil was
present in upper case but still we look
up found the total revenue for Gil which
was in sentence case or proper case next
we saw how we can use Wild Card
characters to use V lookups and here we
saw how to use an if and a function
along with v lookup and finally we saw
how to use two V lookups choose from

on the link in the description to know
more now we are on the sheet of
Microsoft Excel and here you can see
some data on my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop- down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to H
lookup now the first one is the look
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of Jerry reflecting here now
similarly let's find out the salary of
all the employees using H lookup so
equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name of the employee now the
table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third row in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try to find out Peter's employee ID and
salary so there you go one5 and 50,000
as salary so that's how you use H lookup
in Excel here you can see the first
chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee ID Department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salaries now coming to
the new data table and here on the table
two which is an updated table here you
can find we're going to find out the
department of the employee and the
current Department of employee and the
bonus percentage based on his or her
salary so why are we finding current
Department again so here you can see
that we have an intern Emily who has
joined in the air 2020 but recently she
got promoted as a developer so her
department has been changed from
Department in turn to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we're
going to find out here in the current
Department using xlup now let's start to
implement X lookup so for that equals to
X lookup and for lookup you can see if
we need to find out the lookup value
lookup array return array and all the
other two are not important right now
but you can use them to get some exact
matches in the future we'll also use
that in the future for now let's try to
use the first three parameters that is
lookup value look up array and written
array so the lookup value is the name of
the employee Mary and look up array is
right here which is this one now we are
going to select the lookup array then
comma and uh we're going to look up the
department so this is the department
lookup array and that's all we
need close the bracket and press enter
okay I think we missed out the lookup
value so the employee or the lookup
value which we required was missed so
I've added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go press enter and you have
the department here now let's add it to
all the rows and here you have all the
rows and all the data related to all the
employees now we will find out the
current Department as you can see here
you have Emily as intern which is the
older data but what if you needed the
latest data that is the developer in the
year 2021 right for that you might want
to to the x look up formula a little bit
so let's try that X look up look up
value which is the same and comma Now
where you have to look for the array
that is lookup array this one and the
return array which happens to be this
one and
next you can find the exact match for
this one so that's all right exact match
and here comes the important part where
you have to search last to first by
default X lookup searches for first to
last that is like this in the starting
place to the last place so that's the
reason why we had Emily as intern so now
if we give last to first then it
retrieves the latest data where Emily
will be shown as developer now select
that and now you can close the brackets
and press enter so let's add that to all
the r there you go now you can see Emily
Clark Peter and James all they have got
their updated job profiles as you can
see in the original data Emily is a
developer now so is Clark who was
originally a tester and he got promoted
to development team in 2021 similarly
Peter became a senior Finance executive
in 2021 and James the manager of sales
now let's try to find out the bonus for
all these employees based on their
salary so this one is quite simple so X
lookup now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary
range then here is another important
point so here you might want to find the
exact match but finding the exact match
will not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38,000 22,000 39 Etc
but here in the ranges we have provided
10 20 30 40 and 50 so what if the value
is between 30 and 20 that's when you
want the less number right that's when
you want the number which is equalent to
30 or less than 30 which happens to be
15% so that's how it has worked here
that is 0.15% bonus to the actual salary
now we are on our Excel sheet here you
can see the employee names and employee
IDs of different employees from
different zones let us imagine that the
blue one is from East Green one is from
West and the black one is from or the
purple one is from South and the orange
one is from North so
this data is a little small but what if
you had a data with hundreds or
thousands of rows including all the
employee names employee IDs or another
relevant data type like sales of an
employee and his employee ID and you
were supposed to combine all the data
from all the four different zones into
one single sheet it would consume a lot
of time right so recently Microsoft has
released some latest updates based on
arrays and datas so one of those is
vstack function in Excel so how to use
it since it is a latest function I
recommend you to go to the file menu and
in the file menu you can navigate to
account and in the account you can see
the option of update options then you
can select update now and your Microsoft
Office will be updated to the latest
version and you'll get access to the
latest functions in Excel and all the
other office Rel ated things like B one
presentation Etc now we going to
implement the vack function in Excel it
is completely simple all you need to do
is equals to stack and then select the
data remember to select the data from
column A and cell two or the row two we
are not selecting the employee name and
employee ID we are just selecting the
data now separate them by comma then
again this one here this set and again
this
one and again lastly this particular
last set now close the bracket and press
enter and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee IDs all together in one data
set so this is how you use wack function
in Excel and there are also a few more
new updates from Microsoft Excel and we
will discuss on them sooner so the name
itself conveys that it is something like
a reference function right so it refers
to a cell which is present in a
particular sheet or the current sheet or
it refers to a particular range in the
current sheet or it can also refer to an
entire workbook in a current window
right so you can stay here on the sheet
number one and you can refer something
which is present on the sheet number 10
or 11 you can stay in this current
workbook and refer to something which is
around in a different workbook alog
together so that's exactly how the
indirect function in Excel works okay so
I guess the definition was a little uh
difficult to get let me show you a
simple demo here so that it becomes a
little easier for you so currently I'm
in the cell number A2 right now here I
will implement the indirect function
press tab to select it and now I'll
refer to the cell
C2 and let's enter and there you go let
me properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so equals to indirect and
press tab to select now I'll be
selecting the cell C2 and inside C2 we
have E2 address now the formula is fine
I have implemented the indirect function
and selected the cell E2 and now if I
press enter see the magic there you go
so in the cell E2 we have the text hello
world so when I use the indirect
function to refer which is something in
C2 it is indirectly referring to another
cell address that is E2 which has the
text hello world now this one was a
little pretty simpler now let's check
some complicated ones and we'll move to
sheet number one here we have some
student names and their uh you know uh
marks on the individual subjects that is
math science English computer science
and here and here you can see I'm
selecting the student names and
accordingly I'm getting their average
score and the total marks obtained right
seems interesting how did I do this so
this is done exactly using the indirect
function so let's do it again so this is
how you do it now here I will be using
okay before we get into this uh we need
to do some fundamentals before we do it
right so the fundamentals are you need
to name your individual columns so here
here I have Brian and his marks so I'll
select entire marks of Brian ranging
from B2 to B4 right click and here you
can see Define name and I'll be naming
it as
Brian it's already named we might get an
error so it's already named okay let's
add another one
maybe uh Jennifer let's cancel this so
let's uh add
jeny and and her marks will be
96 87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here so
87 so we have the new column here now we
need to name this column Define a name
and it's Jenny so Excel has
automatically selected the name for this
column so let's press okay now we have
our columns ready now here if you see
the drop down we have Amy Banner Brian
Brock Emily Jenny John everyone over
here right so the columns are named the
individual columns are named so now the
student name so here you can use some
simple trick called Data validation here
select the data option in the toolbar
navigate to data tools here select data
validation and uh in this instead of any
value select list and here give the
source as this particular
set press okay so that you get the drop
down menu over here you can also type
the individual names again when you type
the individual names you might go wrong
with the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average will be
uh equals to average press tab to select
now the indirect function indirect
of this cell address and close the
bracket first you might get an error
because currently it is empty so select
some name and you'll get your average
score now same thing applies to uh you
know total uh you can press the sum
function select the sum function and uh
type in the indirect function and uh the
cell V1 close the brackets and press
enter so that's how you do it that's web
Query in Excel now you might be
wondering what exactly is web query so
you all know that Excel is a brilliant
data analytics and business intelligence
tool right so it requires some data to
be stored or some data to be analyzed
right that creates as an opportunity for
the sources so don't think that Excel is
something where you just you know copy
paste the data and that's how it stores
or you need to manually enter the data
no it can get connected to a various and
wide variety of data sources ranging
from a simple file database CSV and
Microsoft Access Data analysis services
and many more and including web right
now there might be a case where you are
you know interested in getting the data
from a direct web page which is dynamic
for example you might be interested in
stock market right and you wanted to you
know take the data which is dynamic
directly from the stock market right so
is it possible for Excel to take and
store the dynamic data yes you can do it
so now here we are on the stock market
India website and let's get into the
most active stocks table click on
that and you are navigated to the most
active shares in India currently now
select the URL of this particular web
page get back to your get back to your
Excel and here on the data button in the
toolbar you can see from text CSV from
web right so let's uh select the get
data option from other sources from web
you can either choose this or feel free
to choose this as well over here so
let's go to web and here you might want
to place your url paste the URL and
press
okay and you will have some time
connecting to the server give it some
time now while we are at it let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
Microsoft Excel and also a lot more
Technologies in the current ID industry
so if you want to get updated on all the
Technologies in the current it market
then make sure that you subscribe to our
Channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply laar now you can see that we are
successfully connected to the data and
you can see various data tables over
here so for example let's select on the
table zero so all this data is the
current active and Dy dyamic data from
the website we selected so let's just
press on load to load just one table as
of now and see how to
works so the data is loading again we
might have to give a little time for the
data to load onto the Excel
spreadsheet now you can see the data has
been successfully loaded and all the
details that is the company name highest
price lowest price lost price change
percentage and the value and cors
everything has been updated including
the 5day performance right now you can
you know hide this because it's a lot of
information to grasp all together now
here you can see all the data has been
currently stored onto the Excel
spreadsheet now you might be wondering
if this particular data is valid or if
this particular data is really dynamic
or not right so to answer that question
let's see to the data option again and
here you can see the refresh button so
click on refresh all and you can see
there is a query running in the
background from the web right so here
you can see running background query so
this will run a query and the numbers
will be
updated so let's remember any one of the
numbers maybe they might be so I'll take
a quick glance here and try to remember
the numbers you can take a screenshot
and after the query has successfully run
you can see some changes in the numbers
right so me maybe some numbers are
changed here since we have finished our
query so that's how the web Query in
Excel works with the dynamic data that
is user form in
Excel so what exactly is a user form so
userform is a graphical user interface
that helps you have an live interaction
with your worksheet which enables you to
enter or eliminate data from your Excel
worksheet through the graphical user
interface now now let's get into the
Practical mode and start the Excel
workbook now we have launched our
Microsoft Excel so let us create a blank
workbook for now now we have the blank
workbook or worksheet now before we get
started with the user forms in Excel the
fundamental step is to enable the
developer menu on the toolbar here you
can find the developer menu so basically
it will not be enabled as default to
enable that you need to get into file
menu and inside the file menu you can
see the last menu that is the options
menu select that and you will have a
dialog box on your screen and inside
that you need to go into the customize
ribbon option and inside the customize
ribon option you have the main tabs
scroll through the main tabs and here
you can find an option called developer
by default it will not be enabled it
will look something like this but to
enable that you need to select the check
option in this and click on that and
select okay now the developer option
will be enabled on your tool menu so now
you have your developer option on your
toolbar so to get started with user
forms in Excel click on the developer
option and here you can see Visual Basic
so click on that Visual Basic and now
you have your new window opened right on
your
screen so this is the visual basics for
applications so here is where you create
your user forms Now to create a user
form just select on insert menu and you
have the option called user
form now a new user form will be created
for
you and that is userform
one so this this is a user form which
you can design and enable to interact
with your worksheet and help you insert
data or eliminate data for now let's try
to create a simple user form for
employees now here you can see the
controls option where you can find the
various options to provide an object
into your user form so it might be a
label it might be a text box it might be
a multi-page it might be a command
button it might be a frame or a toggle
switch many more for now let's make it
simple let's create a
label so this is our first label we have
just dragged and dropped it and let us
name it
as okay so let us select it and rename
it as employee
ID now let's insert another
label drag drop as simple as it
looks select that and rename it as
employee
name now another one you can also copy
that and paste
it and this should be our employee phone
number
now we have our three labels on the
screen let's try to insert the text
box now this is our first text
box for employee
ID now let's copy and paste it so
another text box for m employee name
copy and paste again and the last text
box for employee phone now let us try to
insert the
button so the First Command button let
us rename it as
insert now let us relocate it to a
little bit left now let us try to insert
another
button and here it is these second
button would
be refresh
sheet uh the refresh button will play
the role of uh clearing the text boxes
in case if there is some data already
entered if you want to clear that you
can just press on refresh and it'll be
cleared now we have our user form so let
us try to rename our user form so here
you can see that we have the properties
Tab and inside the properties tab you
can always rename it and to rename it
let us go into caption and rename it as
employee
data and that's done so our basic user
form is ready now let's get back to
Excel sheet so remember that we have
created three labels employee ID
employee name and employee form we need
to create the exact same columns here so
employee ID
let us expand the column a little
bit now em L O ye e
e name let us also increase the width
and finally we have employ
phone there you
go yeah we have our three
columns let us select all the three
columns
and align to
middle you can also format your
cells let us select the green color and
text as
white and let is
bold
yeah pretty
good there you go so we have created our
sheet and it's ready ready now now the
last part remaining is we need to code
this particular user form so coding in
the sense we have two buttons over here
right so those buttons should be
performing some kind of operation so for
insert button the operation should be
inserting the data which we have entered
into these text boxes so to program it
just double click on the insert button
and here eliminate everything and
paste this code so basically what we did
is we had this particular code segment
so this is the starting part of the code
segment and this is the ending part of
the code segment so we are writing our
code in between these two lines so what
did we write here so end of the row is
sheets of sheet name so this is the
sheet name right here we have our sheet
name as sheet one so that is the sheet
name where we want to perform the
operations and range from a to rows
count and XLF row that is we counting
the number of rows here that particular
statement will count the rows till the
end of the sheet automatically and after
that it will shift to textbox value that
is once the row number is counted that
is from 1 to n it will start entering
data from the first available row that
is a column
a column then once the a column is
finished it will enter into B column and
subsequently into C and once the text
boxes are entered the data that is let's
come back to here so once we have
entered all the text that is the
employee ID name and phone after
selecting the insert button
automatically these three text boxes
should go blank again you cannot have
the same data again in your text box
so that is why we have included textbox
value one null textbox value two null
textbox value 3 null so that was for
command operation insert now we should
program the command operation for
refresh double click on
that and you have the code option over
here so this particular code will be
automatically loaded from The Click
button one now for click button to you
need to add some more data that is
refreshing so whenever you press the
refresh button the text should go blank
for that we'll use the same code from
the previous click button or the command
button paste it over here and they
should perform the clearing operation
and it's done now close this so select
the employee data user form and here you
can see the Run option so select that
run option and the sheet has the user
form here now let us enter the employee
ID as 1 2 3 4 5 and employee name as
JN okay caps Lo is on JN John employee
phone as some
1800 2 3
1 and select the insert option and the
data got inserted now let us try to
insert another data 1 2 3 4
six employee name
Wick and employee phone number 180
345 Yeah by now you might have guessed
I'm a fan of John Wick yes and yeah
there you go we have entered the second
data over here now let me show you
another trick where you can place all
this user form as a macro and replace
this by just one single button so
whenever you press that button this data
for or user form will pop up and you can
directly start entering data so for that
let's get back to the Visual Basic and
stop this particular execution and you
got your user form back now you need to
insert a model get into insert option
and select the module or model yeah it
is module not model so inside this
module you need to write the command for
macro so here it is
so what we basically doing is a m p l y
e e data Dosh show or we can use an
underscore and get back to user phone
and rename this
as
dat cool so what we are doing is
entering the subject as enter employ
details this will be the macro name and
and when this macro is called the
employee data user form should be shown
and once it is shown the code should be
ended that is end subject now we have
designed our
module now let's get back to the
sheet and here go to the developer
option go to the insert menu and select
button and draw the button
somewhere and now you can select the
enter employee details macro and and
press okay and now you have a button
here now you can edit
this edit it as press to
enter enter employee
details and there you go done so now
whenever you press this particular
button the user form will activate
Okay and you need to play this
okay the error was related to the
employee data sheet name we had to
rename the employee data from user form
to employ data initially it was just
user form we have renamed that to employ
data and now the code is fine so let's
get back to the sheet now if you press
this button the user form will
automatically start now let us try to
enter the data again 1 2 3 4 57 this
time and uh some name
let's enter
as
Jennifer and her phone number would be 1
18345 098 some random number and select
insert and the data has been inserted
here so this is how you work on user
forms in Excel now at times you might be
working on a really important
spreadsheet on your Excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some parut issue and you forgot to
save or you miss to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly going to discuss the same
and see how to do it in multiple ways so
Excel comes up with an option to
automatically save the data also it will
try to warn you that your data data is
not being saved would you like me to
save it or not right so we'll do the
first one so here you have the autosave
option you can either say okay to it or
you can ignore it in case if you ignore
it if you choose to ignore it or if you
choose to manually save it and then if
you want to close the file remember we
haven't saved the file if you wish to
close it Excel will automatically come
up with a dialog box asking you want to
save your changes to your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of bar issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open or try to start Excel when you get
the power backup again and if if you
want to open that same data file it will
ask you the document recovery option it
says you have close the file without
saving the changes and you can choose to
you know come back from the same place
where we left last time okay now that
was the paret issue and now let's see uh
another way okay let's imagine that
somebody uh eliminated few important
data files from your organization's
confidential data employee ID employee
name Etc and again uh let's simulate the
force uh close of the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data was been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place
so this was one way also we have another
few multiple ways just we have to
navigate to file and here you can open
and in the open menu you have a button
called recover unsaved workbooks not
just the current workbook it will also
have all the remaining files which are
related to excel that are not saved so
here you have a few workbooks which was
not saved this is one option and we also
have another option we can just navigate
to info and there you have another
option called manage workbook and in the
manage workbook you have another option
called recover unsaved workbooks which
will also redirect you to the same file
that is Microsoft Office unsaved files
and you'll have all the unsaved
workbooks which are related to excel so
this is how you can recover the unsaved
data in Excel using multiple ways first
thing Excel will automatically ask you
if you have to save the file or not and
in case if you forget to save it you can
directly recover it by default by Excel
it will automatically show that some
folder was not saved on the left side of
your Excel spreadsheet by default and in
case if you missed out on that one you
can manually go to file and you can
either choose open option or info option
to recover the unsa folders from your
default file location from your PC that
is Microsoft Office unsaved files
Etc which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to ex let's
see what is a project plan project plan
is a basic thing that is needed to
execute a project according to project
management book of knowledge a project
can be defined as an approved
elaborative document that guides the
team during project execution and
project control when we are making a
project plan a project plan must answer
several questions for us these questions
are like what are we expecting our
project to deliver how are we expecting
to get a deliverables within the desired
time who all will be a part of a project
and what tasks they will have in the
project when will the project start and
when it is expected to end that is the
deadlines of the project now let us
learn about project management in Excel
Microsoft Excel is one of the most
common application these days it is used
in both offices and at homes Microsoft
Excel is an easy project management tool
that allows the team members to easily
see the tasks in a project develop a
plan and track its progress before we
learn more about project management in
Excel let's first have a look why do we
use Excel Microsoft Excel is an easy
tool tool to plan a project so it can be
used by people who are beginners in
terms of project management in Excel one
can find several analytical tools like
concatenate Len and counter so this
makes data analysis easy and effective
as the entry of data is easy same is
tracking and controlling of project
status then there are several project
management templates in Excel that help
us to have an effective distribution of
project data we will be checking several
project management templates towards the
end of this video now let's have a look
at the process of making a Gant chart in
Excel before we begin this it's
important we know what is a Gant chart a
Gant chart is like an horizontal bar
chart that is used for project
management with the help of a Gant chart
we can check the status of the task the
date they start the date they end and
their dependencies on each other Gand
chart helps in coordinating and
monitoring different tasks in a project
now let's have a look at the steps that
will help us in making a Gand chart
first step we have is make a project
table we have several rows and columns
like here we have three columns in the
First Column we have the tasks in the
second we have a start date and in the
third column we have the duration or
tenure of the task the second step is to
make a bar chart in Excel for this we
will select the entire second column
then we will go on the insert Tab and
click on the bar graph chart there we
can select stag bar graph in 2D bar
charts as a result we will have the
entitled bar graph on the screen in the
third step we will add the duration to
the bar graph we will right click on the
chart and in the menu that appears we
will select select data option a window
that appears on the screen in that that
window we will select add option as
shown we can also see the start date is
already in the entry section then in the
dialogue box that appears type tenure in
the series name and click on the Range
selection icon that's shown in the
figure now select the relevant data from
the tenure column and click on okay now
we can see a bar graph that has two
colors on the screen this bar graph now
has the duration of the tasks the fourth
step we have is adding description to
the Gant chart now we will open the box
again and in that box we will select the
edit option as shown in the figure then
we will select the tasks as we had
selected the duration of the tasks
before and click on okay we can now see
the tasks have appeared towards the left
side of the Gan chart the fifth and the
remarkable step will help us convert
this bar graph into a Gand chart we will
now click on the bars and select the
format data series option from the menu
that appears then in the format data
series dialogue box we will select no
fill option we can find our Gan chart on
the screen now in accordance with the
data that we had entered now we can see
the tasks on the left side are in the
reverse order so what we will do next is
we will click on the task panel then go
to the format access dialog box and
select the categories in reverse order
option now we can find our tasks in the
right order one more thing we can notice
is Gan chart is starting with some other
date and not with the dates that we had
entered so for this we will copy the
first date in some other cell then
clicking on the copied cell we will go
to the home menu to select the dialog
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop- down menu you will select the
number option we can now find a value
displayed in the copied cell we will
copy that value click on the dates on
the chart and as the format access
dialog box opens we will paste that
value in the box that says minimum shown
in the figure as a result we will have
our final Gan chart on the screen in the
last step we can give several designs to
a Gand chart change colors and make it
more presentable for us now when we know
the basic steps of making a Gand chart I
will show that practically to you in
Microsoft Excel our first step is to
open Microsoft Excel and and in
Microsoft Excel we will make a project
table in a project table we will have
three columns the First Column will be
task the second column will have the
start date the third column will have
tenure or the duration of the task so
beginning with tasks we have task one in
task one we have 1.1 1.2 1.3 then comes
task 2 in task two we have 2.1 2.2 2.3
and 2.4 then we have task three in task
3 we will have two subsections 3.1 and
3.2 then we will start with the starting
dates in starting dates we'll put 1st
January the Task 1 1.1 will be 1st of
January then this will be 4th January
let's say this is 5th January then we
will put this as 11th of January and
this will be again 11th January only
this will be 15th January let's put this
as 17th January let this be 19th January
task 3 begins on 23rd January and it the
3.2 section begins at 26th of January
now let's put the tenure or the duration
of the task we will begin with task one
it takes 12 days then 1.1 takes 7 days
we say this takes 4 days and this takes
8 days then for task two it again takes
12 days it takes 5 days 5 days
and let's say this takes 6 days and this
takes 4 days then we come to task three
this takes 8 days and let's say this
takes 6 days and the 3.2 section takes 5
days so this is how our project table is
ready in the second step we will select
the entire second column after we have
selected this column we will go to the
insert tab in the insert tab we'll go to
the bar colums and in this we will
select 2D staged bar charts now we have
the entitled bar chart in accordance to
our data on the screen then comes the
third step we will add the duration of
the tasks to the bar graph we will click
on the chart and after we click on the
chart we will select select data option
in the select data source dialog box we
find the start date is already there now
we will click on ADD and after we click
on add in the series name section we
will put tenure then in the series value
we will click on this icon and select
the entire tenor series and and click on
okay so this is the bar graph that we
have now this is now in two colors the
orange color and the blue color this bar
graph now has the duration of all the
tasks in our project table now in the
fourth step now it's time for us to add
description to our Gand chart instead of
this 1 2 3 4 5 we will put task one task
two and the subtasks so what we will do
is we will again go to that box we will
left click on the Gan chart select the
select data option and then we'll go to
the start date here we'll select the
edit option in the edit option we will
select all the tasks and click on okay
now we can see all the tasks are aligned
towards the left of the bar chart as we
can see this is a bar chart or a bar
graph and not a gan chart the next step
we have is converting this bar graph
into a gan chart so we will click on the
bars and select the format data series
option from the menu that appears here
we have this format data series option
now we can see the dialog box on the
screen here we'll go into the color
section fill section and then we will
select no fill now we can see the blue
lines have disappeared so this looks
like a gan chart so now when we have a
Gand chart on the screen we can notice
that the tasks here are in the reverse
order so what we will do is we will
click on these tasks and select the
format X as option here we'll select
categories in reverse order we can see
our Gan chart is now in order like we
have our task one on the top and task
three at the bottom the dates are
starting from 11th of December but the
dates we have provided are from 1st of
January now we will copy this cell then
go on the dates box here we'll go to
format access in the format access we
can see minimum in this minimum we will
paste this value and press enter as we
press enter we can see our Gand chart
starting from the date that we wanted to
start and that to in the correct order
starting from task one to task three now
as a result we have our final Gan chart
on the screen in the last step what we
can do is make our Gan chart more
representable we can change the color of
These Bars we can give them shapes and
we can do many other things to make it
more presentable we will first select
the bars like what we will do is we will
select task one and let's say we give it
the color blue then task two we will
give it color green and in task three
we'll give it give it the color black so
here the subsections will give different
colors to the subsections as well then
we come to task 2.1 this is how we can
change the color of these cells or apart
from changing colors we can select a bar
graph and do the gradient fill so this
is how we can make a gan chart more
presentable after changing the colors or
changing the shapes we have our final
Gan chart on the screen finally let's
have a look at some Microsoft Excel
templates for project management
Microsoft Excel templates help in
collecting data putting them into order
and check their dependencies with each
other with the help of these templates
we can monitor the status of the tasks
and we can also check the progress our
project has made moving forth we will
check some important Microsoft Excel
templates the first template we have is
Excel project review template this
template helps us have an overview of
the project we can have a clear
understanding of all the tasks that are
planned and that are completed this
helps project managers to measure the
progress of the project and take further
steps accordingly second template we
will check is Excel budget template in
this template we can monitor all the
expenditures of our project it helps us
in managing the budget of a project and
also helps in comparing the budget of a
project at different phases let's have a
look at the budget template in Excel
once we can download this template from
Office timeline.com the G chart towards
the right is an accordance with the
dates towards the left if we fluctuate
the date we can see the template working
the start date for task one could be
changed to 10th June if we change this
date to 10th June we can see the
fluctuation in the grand chart so this
is how we can use this template directly
let's have a look at the third template
now third template we will see is Excel
Sprint Project tracker template this
template is used majorly in agile
projects where the project is made in
several Sprints or sessions this
template includes the start date the end
date and the duration of each task we
can also see the percentage completed of
each task let's have a look at the
Sprint Project tracker temp template as
well we can see the Gan chart towards
the right and the data towards the left
so if we change any data we can see the
Gan chart changing for example we can
change the data in Sprint 2 feature 3
let's change the start date to July 2nd
we can see the Gand chart changing this
is how we can use this template directly
to track our sessions let's have a look
at the fourth Excel template this
template is Excel project tracker in
this template we have the data of all
the tasks with the status and owners we
can track the percentage of task
completed and also compare the planned
duration of the task to the actual
duration of the task after the critical
part tracker let's check the Excel
project schedule template this template
helps in effective management of the
project as it helps in monitoring the
time that each task of the project takes
it provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel ones we
can see the Gan chart in accordance to
the data if we change the estimated
hours at two places let's say at the
design review we make it 15 hours
instead of 5 hours and at the create
Staffing plan we make it 2 hours instead
of 20 hours we can see the Gant chart
fluctuating this is how we can use this
template to manage the schedule in a
project moving forward the next template
we will see is Excel project status
report template this template helps us
having a list of project deliverables
and the risks associated with that
project this template helps the project
managers about different crucial
activities involved in a project after
this we have Excel Milestone tracker the
Milestone tracker helps us in tracking
or monitoring different tasks in a
project project managers use this
template to monitor the project
performance with respect to the
timelines the last template we will see
is Excel project planner Excel project
planner includes a list of task with the
respected owners along with the start
date and the end date of that task this
helps in monitoring each task and
comparing the estimated task date with
the actual ones let's have a look at
this template in Excel we can see the
Gan chart with respect to the data
entered let's make changes at several
places in the data we can make this 22
to 24 we will make this 23 go to 2 and
we can make this 5th September go to
15th September and when we make the
changes we can realize the Gant chart is
fluctuating so this is how we can use
this template to plan a project
effectively and efficiently so first
let's understand what exactly is misis
report in Excel
so Mis stands for management information
system Mis reports provide data on
different categories for accurate
decision making so Mis in Excel is a
procedure to create interactive report
using Microsoft Excel so Mis reports
help management to access the
performance of organization and allow
faster decision making so if you know to
create the Mis reports using various
business intelligence tools such as as
Excel then you might find a very good
job opportunity in a well established
company now let us try to learn how to
create Mis report using Excel in a
practical mode so let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel IF getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so here you can
see that I've got some sales data of
various car manufacturing companies and
I've also got some slices so using these
slicers I can get the realtime
information from the dashboard so I'll
select an ER from the first slicer and
I'll go into the second slicer and I'll
select a company now I'll select BMW and
SUV type so we have the data of all the
SUV types cars manufactured by BMW car
manufacturing company in the year 2018
now let's start and create something
similar to this
one so how did I create this mis report
let's go through this in a step-by-step
way so on my screen you can see that we
have created a completely new Excel
workbook and we have some sample data
with five rows and 20 columns so this
particular data is based on the
manufacturer year and the car
manufacturing company and the type of
the car manufactured and number of cars
manufactured in that particular year and
also the price of that particular car
now to create Mis reports we need need
to play around fav tables so we also
have tutorials on fav tables and you can
go through that in our simply learn
YouTube channel and also we will try to
link those in the description box below
now let's select the entire data and go
into the insert ribbon and there you can
see the first option that is pivot
table so after selecting the pivot table
option it will show this particular
dialogue box where it will ask you for
the range of cells you need to select
and the next one is to create the P
table in the same sheet or a new sheet
so we'll take a new sheet here now
select okay and there you go you have
the pivot table here so first you have
an empty pivot table and on the right
side you can see we have pivot table
Fields now you can either drag these
options into the rows and columns or you
can also click it so now let's drag and
drop these first we will select
here and uh card
followed by that we will take type
quantity and price to
columns so there you go we have our
pivot table now let's select all the
data in the pivot table and again let's
get back to the insert
option and here you can see an option
called pivot chart select that and you
will have various pivot chart options
here now you can select any one which
you can can prefer or which you like or
whichever you think can represent your
data in a best way possible so now let's
go with column chart first let's select
okay and we have our column chart over
here now this happens to be our first
chart now let's create a few more charts
so to create few more charts we'll go
back to the same original data select
again insert and pivot
table now again a new worksheet
so here we have another MTP table in the
similar way let's drag the same data
into rows and
columns there you go and again we will
select all the data and create a pivot
chart
go to insert option pivot chat and now
let's try to select py
chat select okay and we have our pie
chart over here now let's try to create
one more same procedure select table
select pivot table then create new
worksheet for the new pivot table and
now drag and drop the data
now let's go to insert
again let's select all the data go to
insert option and pivot chart now let's
try to select the bar chart select okay
and there we have our bar chart now
remember the first chart we created that
is in sheet two this one so we will try
to move all the charts to this
particular table or this particular
worksheet so let's get back to the sheet
number three write click and you can see
an option called pivot chart analyze so
from here you can move the chart select
the option of moving the chart and don't
select the first one select the object
in option and select the sheet number to
which you want to move this chart for
now we want to move this chart to sheet
number two select that press okay now we
have the chart moved to the sheet number
two and in the same way let's go to the
sheet number four and let's move this
particular chart to sheet number
two there you go the chart got moved to
sheet number
two now you can insert the slices so we
have selected the third sheet or third
chart and inside the pivot chart analyze
option we have an option of inserting
the slicer now we will insert the
slicers for ear car
and
type now select okay and you will have
all the three slices onto your sheet now
let's rearrange them
so I'm just organizing them in a neat
way there you
go and you can also customize your
designs for all the
charts so that they look a little more
better now if you see if I make some
changes only one chart will be
interacting for this right so if I
select Ferrari and year 2020 and option
as Sports you can see only one chart is
interacting to these particular slices
why because all these slices are
connected to just one chart here so you
need to make sure that all the slicers
are connected to all the three charts
what we created so let's erase all the
filters and select one slicer at a time
right click and you will see an option
of report connections select that and
you see that the connections are only
connected to the pivot table 3 so select
the remaining pivot tables as well
select okay and in the same way select
the second slicer select the report
connection option connect pivot table 1
and two and select okay and in the same
way the third
one so now all the slices are connected
to all the pivot charts now if you make
some changes here they will respond
automatically in the same way now let's
select the for company the year 2019 and
hashack option and you have all the cars
which were made in the year 2019 from
Ford Company in the segment of
hashack so this was the sample data set
that we worked on now you can also work
on some complex data set such as this
Superstore data
set now one thing you need to make sure
that when you working with Excel Mis you
need to make sure that all the macros
are disabled on your data set and you
convert the entire data into the regular
table format of excel right now Excel is
considering this particular data as a
database so for that you need to select
all the datar Press contr T and then
convert the entire data in the form form
of tabular data and also don't forget to
click this icon which reads my table has
headers so the first row is the headers
now let's select okay and your entire
data will be converted into tabular form
now let's reset this to the
normal type which has the clear color
not all the fancy colors now the entire
data is converted from the dbms to the
Tet form and now he can start
implementing the Mis reports and PIV
tables and so why exactly do we need to
do time serious analysis typically we
would like to predict something in the
future and uh it could be stock prices
it could be the sales or um anything
that needs to be predicted into the
future that is when we use time series
analysis so it is um as the name
suggests it is forecasting and typically
when we say predict it need not be into
the future in machine learning in data
analysis when we talk about predicting
we are not necessarily talking about the
future but in Time series analysis we
typically predict the future so we have
some past data and we want to predict
the future that is when we perform time
series analysis so what are some of the
examples uh it could be daily stock
price the shares as we talk about or it
could be the interest rates weekly
interest rates or sales figures of a
company so these are some of the
examples where we use time series data
we have historical data which is
dependent on time and then based on that
we create a model to predict the future
so what exactly is uh time series so
time series data has time as one of the
components as the name suggests so in
this example let's say this is the stock
price data and uh one of the components
so there are two columns here column B
is the price and column A is BAS
basically the time information in this
case the time is a day so the primarily
the closing price of a particular stock
has been recorded on a daily basis so
this is a Time series data and the time
interval is obviously a day time series
or time intervals can be daily weekly
hourly or even sometimes there is
something like a sensor data it could be
every few milliseconds or micros as well
so the size of the time interval can
vary but they are fixed so if I'm saying
that the it is daily data then the
interval is fixed as daily if I'm saying
this data is an hourly data then it is
the data is captured every hour and so
on so the time intervals are fixed the
interval itself you can uh decide based
on what kind of data we are capturing so
this is a graphical representation the
previous one here we saw the table
representation and this is how to plot
the data so on the Y AIS is let's say
the price price or the the stock price
and x-axis is the time so against time
if you plot it this is how a Time series
graph would look so as the name suggests
what is time series data time series
data is basically a sequence of data
that is recorded over a specific
intervals of time and based on the past
Valu so if we want to do an analysis of
Time series past data we try to forast a
future and uh again as the name suggests
it is time series data which means that
it is time dependent so time is one of
the components of this data time series
data consists of primarily four
components one is the trend then we have
the seasonality then cyclicity and then
last but not least irregularity or the
random component sometimes is also
referred to as a random component so
let's see what each of these components
are so what is Trend trend is overall
change or the pattern of the data which
means that the data may be let me just
uh pull up the pen and uh show you so
let's say you have a data set somewhat
like this a Time series data set
somewhat like this all
right so what is the overall trend there
is an overall trend which is upward
Trend as we call it here right so it is
not like it is continuously increasing
there are times when it is dipping then
there are times when it is increasing
then it is decreasing and so on but
overall over a period of time from the
time we start recording to the time we
end there is a trend right there is an
upward Trend in this case so the trend
need not always be upwards there could
be a downward Trend as well so for
example here there is a downward Trend
right so this is basically what is uh a
trend overall whether the data is
increasing or decreasing all right then
we have the next component which is
seasonality what is seasonal it
seasonality as the name suggest once
again changes over a period of time and
periodic changes right so there is a
certain pattern um let's take the sales
of warm clothes for example so if we
plot it along the months so let's say
January February March April May June
July and then let's say it goes up to
December okay so this is our December a
d I will just mark it as d and then you
again have Jan FB March and then you get
another December okay and just for
Simplicity let's mark this as Decembers
as the end of the year and then one more
December okay so what will happen when
if you're talking about warm clothes
what happens the sales of warm clothes
will increase probably around December
when it is cold and then they will come
down and then again around December
again they will increase and then the
sales will come down and then there will
be again an increase and then they will
come down and then again an increase and
then they will come down let's say this
is the sales pattern so you see here
there is a trend as well there is an
upward Trend right the sales are
increasing over let's say these are
multiple years this is for year one this
is for year two this is for year three
and so on so for multiple years overall
the trend there is an upward Trend the
sales are increasing but it is not a
continuous increase right so there is a
certain pattern so what is happening
what is the pattern every December the
sales are increasing or they are peing
for that particular year right then
there is a new year again when December
approaches the sales are increasing
again when December approaches the sales
are increasing and so on and so forth so
this is known as seasonality so there is
a certain fluctuation which is uh which
is periodic in nature so this is known
as seasonality then cyclicity what is
cyclicity now cyclicity is somewhat
similar to seasonality but here the
duration between two cycles is much
longer so seasonality typically is
referred to as an annual kind of a
sequence like for example we saw here so
it is pretty much like every year in the
month of December the sales are
increasing however cyclicity what
happens is first of all the duration is
pretty much not fixed and the duration
or the Gap length of time between two
cycles can be much longer so recession
is an example so we had let's say
recession session in 2001 or 2002
perhaps and then we had one in
2008 and then we had probably in 201
2012 and so on and so forth so it is not
like every year this happens probably so
there is usually when we say recession
there is a slump and then it recovers
and then there is a slump and then it
recovers and probably there is another
bigger slump and so on right so you see
here this is similar to seasonality but
first of all this length is much more
than a year right that is number one and
it is not fixed as well it is not like
every four years or every 6 years that
duration is not fixed so the the
duration can vary at the same time the
gap between two cycles is much longer
compared to seasonality all right so
then what is irregularity irregularity
is like the random component of the time
series data so there is like you have
part which is the trend which tells
whether the overall it is increasing or
decreasing then you have cyclicity and
seasonality which is like kind of a
specific pattern right uh then there is
a cyclicity which is again a pattern but
at much longer intervals plus there is a
random component so which is not really
which cannot be accounted for very
easily right so there will be a random
component which can be really random as
the name suggest right so that is the
irregularity component so these are the
various components of Time series data
yes there are conditions where we cannot
use time series analysis right so is it
can we do time series analysis with any
kind of data no not really so what are
the situations where we are uh we cannot
do time series analysis so there will be
some data which is collected over a
period of time but it's really not
changing so it will not really not make
sense to perform many time series
analysis over it right for example like
this one so if we take X as the time and
Y as the value of whatever the output we
talking about and if the Y value is
constant there is really no analysis
that you can do uh leave alone time
series analysis right so that is one
another possibility is yes there is a
change but it is changing as per a very
fixed function like a sine wave or a COS
wave again time series analysis will not
make sense in this kind of a situation
because there is a definite pattern here
there is a definite function that the
data is following so it will not make
sense to do a Time series analysis now
before performing any time series
analysis uh the data has to be
stationary and uh typically time cies
data is not stationary so in which case
you need to make the data stationary
before we apply any models like ARA
model or any of these right so what
exactly is stationary data and what is
meant by stationary data let us take a
look first of all what is non-stationary
data time series data if you recall from
one of my earlier slides we said that
time series data has the following four
components the trend seasonality
cyclicity and random random component or
irregularity right so if these
components are present in Time series
data it is non-stationary which means
that typically these components will be
present therefore most of the time A
Time series data that collected raw data
is non-stationary data so it has to be
changed to stationary Data before we
apply any of these algorithms all right
so a
nonstationary Time series data would
look like this which means like for
example here there is an upward Trend
the seasonality component is there and
also the random component and so on so
if the data is not stationary then the
time series forecasting will be affected
so you cannot really perform a Time
series forecasting on a non-stationary
data so how do we differentiate between
a stationary and a non-stationary Time
series data typically or technically one
is of course you can do it visually in
non-stationary data the the data will be
more flattish the seasonality will of
course be there but the trend will not
be there so the data May if we plot that
it may appear somewhat like this right
it's a horizontal line along the
horizontal line you will see compared to
the original data which was there was an
upward Trend so it was changing somewhat
like this right so this is nonstationary
data and this is how a stationary data
would look visually what does this mean
technically this means that stationarity
of the data depends on a few things but
the mean the variance and the
co-variance so these are the three
components on which the stationarity of
the data depends so let's take a look at
what each of these are for stationary
data the mean should not be aun function
of time which means that the mean should
pretty much remain constant over a
period of time right so there is there
shouldn't be any change uh so this is
how the stationary data would look and
this is how a non-stationary data would
look I've shown in the previous slide as
well so here the mean is increasing that
means there is an upward Trend okay so
that is one part of it and then the
variance of the series should not be
also a function of time so the variance
also should be pretty much common or
should be constant rather so this is a
if we visually we take a look this is
our time series stationary data would
look where the variance is not changing
here the variance is changing therefore
this is nonstationary and we cannot
apply time series forecasting on this
kind of data similarly the co-variance
which is basically of the ith term and
the I plus M term should not be a
function of time as well so co-variance
is nothing but not only the variance at
the ith term but the relation between
the variance at the ith term and the I
plus M or the I plus n term so as again
once again visually this is how it would
look if the co-variance is also changing
with respect to time so these are the
three all three component should be
pretty much constant and that is when
you have stationary data and in order to
perform time series analysis the data
should be stationary okay so let's take
a look at uh the concept of moving
average or the method of moving average
and let's see how it works we'll do
simple calculations so let's say this is
our sample data we have the data for
three months January February March the
sales in hundreds of in thousands rather
not hundreds thousands of dollars is
given here and uh now we want to find
the moving average so how do we find the
moving average we call it as moving
average three so moving average three is
nothing but you take three of the values
or the readings add them up and divide
by three basically the way we take a
mean or average of the three values so
that is as simple as that so that's the
average first of all so what is moving
average moving average is if you now
have a series of data you keep taking
the three values the next three values
and then you take the average of that
and then the next three values and so on
and so forth so that is how you take the
moving average so let's take a little
more detailed example of car sales so
this is how we have the car sales data
for the entire year let's say so rather
for for four years so year one we have
for each quarter quarter 1 2 3 4 and
then year two quarter 1 2 3 4 and so on
and so forth so this is how we have
sales data of a particular car let's say
or a showroom and uh we want to forecast
for year five so we have the data for
four years we now want to forus for the
fifth year let's see how it works first
of all if we plot the data as it is uh
taken the raw data this is how it would
look and uh what do you think it is is
it stationary no right because there is
a trend upward Trend so this is not a
stationary data so we um we need to
later we will see how to make it
stationary but to start with just an
example we will not worry about it for
now we will just go ahead and uh
manually do the forecasting using what
is known as moving average method okay
so we are not applying any algorithm or
anything like that in the next video we
will see how to apply an algorithm how
to make it stationary and so on all
right so uh um here we see that all the
three or four components that we talked
about um are there there is a trend
there is a seasonality and then of
course there is some random component as
well cyclicity may not be it is possible
that cyclicity is not applicable in all
the situations for sales especially
there may not be or unless you're taking
a sales for maybe 20 30 years cyclicity
may not come into play so we will just
consider uh primarily the trend tonality
and irregularity right so Random it is
also known as random irregularity right
so we were calling the random or
irregularity component so these are the
three main components typically in this
case we will talk about so this is the
trend component and um we will see how
to do these uh calculations so let's
take a look redraw the table including
the time code we will add another column
which is the time code and uh the column
and we'll just number it like 1 2 3 4 up
to 16 the rest of the data Remains the
Same okay so we will do the calculations
now now let us do the moving a average
calculations um or ma4 as we call it for
each year so we take all the four
quarters and we take an average of that
so if we add up these four values and
divide by four you get the moving
average of 3.4 so we start by putting
the value here so that will be for the
third quarter let's say 1 2 3 the third
quarter then we will go on to the next
one so we take the next four values as
you see here and take the average of
that which is the moving average for the
next quarter and so on and so forth now
if we just do the moving average uh it
is not centered so what we do is we
basically add one more column and we
calculate the centered moving average as
shown here so here what we do is we take
the average of two values and then just
adding these values here so for example
the first value for the third quarter is
actually the average of the third and
the fourth quarter so we have 3.5 now it
gets centered so similarly the next
value would be 3.6 + 3.9 ided 2 so which
is 3.7 and so on and so forth okay so
that is the centered moving average this
is done primarily to smooth the data so
that there are not too many any rough
edges so that is what we do here so if
we visualize this data now this is how
it looks right so if we take the
centered moving average as you can see
there is a gradual increase if this was
not the case if we had not centered it
the changes would have been much sharper
so that is the basically the smoothening
that we are talking about now let's go
and or do the forecast for the fifth
year so in order to do the forecast what
we will do is we will take the centered
moving average as our Baseline and then
start doing a few more calculations that
are required in order to come up with
the prediction so what we are going to
do is we are going to use this
multiplicity or multiplicative model in
this case and this is how it it looks so
we take the product of seasonality and
uh the trend and the irregularity
components and we just multiply that and
in order to get that this product of
these two We have basically the actual
value divided by CMA YT value divided by
CMA will give you the predicted value of
YT is equal to the product of all three
components therefore St into YT is equal
to YT by CMA so this is like this is
equal to YT right so therefore if we
want St into YT the product of
seasonality and irregularity is equal to
YT by CMA so that is our we will work it
out I also have an Excel sheet of the
actual data so let me just pull that up
all right so this is how the data looks
in Excel as you can see here year 1
quarter 1 2 3 4 year 2 quarter 1 2 3 4
and so on and this is the sales data and
then this is the moving average as I
mentioned this is how we calculate and
this is the centered moving average so
this is the primary component that we
will start working with and then we will
calculate since we want the product of
St into YT that is equal to YT by C CMA
so if you see these values are nothing
but the YT value divided by CMA so in
this case it is 4 by 3.5 which is 1.14
similarly 4.5 by 3.7 1.22 and so on and
so forth so we take we have the product
St into it and uh then the next step is
to uh calculate the average of
respective quarters so that is what we
are doing here average of respective
quarters and then we need to calculate
the deseasonalized values so in order to
get deseasonalized value we need to
divide YT by St that was calculated so
for example here it is 2.8 by .9 so we
got the deionized value here and uh then
we get the trend and then we get the
predicted uh values so in order to get
the predicted value which is basically
we predict the values for known values
as well like for example examp year one
quarter 1 we know the value but now that
we have our model we predict ourselves
and see how close it is so we predicted
as 2.89 whereas the actual value is 2.8
then we have 2.59 the actual value is
2.1 and so on just to see how our model
works and then continue that into the
fifth year because for fifth year we
don't have a reference value okay and if
we plot this we will come to know how
well our calculations are how well our
manual model in this case we did not
really use a model but we did on our own
manually so it will tell us the trend so
for example the predicted value is this
gray color here and you can see that it
is actually pretty much following the
actual value which is the blue color
right and the gray color is the
predicted value so the wherever we know
the values up to year four we can see
that our predicted values are following
or pretty much very close to the actual
values and then from here onwards when
the year five starts starts the blue
color line is not there because we don't
have the actual values only the
predicted values so we can see that
since it was following the trend pretty
much for the last four years we can
safely assume that it has understood the
pattern and it is predicting correctly
for the next one year the next four
quarters right so that is what we are
doing here so these four quarters we did
not have actual data but we have the
predicted values so let's go back and
see how this is working in this using
the slides so this is we already saw
this part and U I think it was easier to
see in the Excel sheet so we calculated
the St it the product of St and it using
the formula like here y by YT by CMA we
got that and then we got ST which is
basically YT so this is average of the
first quarters for all the four years
and uh similarly this is the average of
the second quarter for all the four
years and so on so these values are
repeating there they are calculated only
once they get repeated as you can see
here and uh then we get the
deseasonalized data and that is
basically YT by St so we calculated St
here and we have YT so YT by St will
give you the deseasonalized data and uh
we have got rid of the seasonal and The
Irregular component so far now what we
are left with is the trend and uh before
we start the time series forecasting or
time series analysis as I mentioned
earlier we need to completely get rid of
the non-stationary components so we are
still left with the trend component so
now let us also remove the trend
component in order to do that we have to
find the or we have to calculate the
intercept and slope of the data because
that is required to calculate the trend
and uh how are we going to do that we
will actually use um what is known as a
regression tool or Analytics tool that
is available in Excel so you remember we
have our data in Excel so let me take
you to the Excel and uh here we need to
calculate the intercept and the slope in
order to do that we have to use the
regression mechanism and in order to use
the regression mechanism we have to use
the Analytics tool that comes with Excel
so how do you activate this tool so this
is how you would need to activate the
Tool uh from Excel you need to go to
options and uh in options there will be
addins and uh in addin you will have um
analysis tool pack and you select this
and um you just say go it will open up a
box like this you say analysis tool pack
and you say Okay And now when you come
back in to the regular view of excel in
the data tab you will see data analysis
activated so you need to go to file
options and addins and then analysis
tool pack typically since I've already
added it it is coming at the top but it
would come under inactive application
addin so when you're doing it for the
first sty so don't use VBA you just say
analysis tool pack there are two options
one with VBA like this one and one
without VBA so just use the one without
VBA and then instead of just saying okay
just take care that you click on this go
and not just okay so you say go then it
will give you these options only then
you select just the analysis tool pack
and then you say okay all right so and
then when you come back to the main view
you click on data okay so this is your
normal home view perhaps so you need to
come to data and here is where you will
see data analysis available to you and
then if you click on that there are a
bunch of possibilities what kind of data
analysis you want to do if there are
options are given right now we just want
to do regression because we want to find
the slope and The Intercept so select
regression and you say
okay and you will get these options for
input y range and input X range input y
range is the value YT so you just select
this and you can select up to here and
press enter and input X range you can
for now you start with uh the baseline
or you can also start with the D
seasoned values so you can just click on
these and say
okay I have already calculated it so
these are the intercept and the
coefficients that we are getting for
these values and we will actually use
that to calculate our Trend here right
so which is in the J column so trend is
equal to intercept plus slope into the
time code so The Intercept is uh out
here as we can see in our slide as well
so if you see here this is our intercept
and the lower value is the slope we have
calculated here and it's shown in the
slides as well so intercept the formula
is shown here so our trend is equal to
intercept plus slope into time code time
code is nothing but this one t column A
1 2 3 4 okay so that's how you calculate
the trend and that's how you use the
data analysis tool from Excel using
these two we calculate the predicted
values and using this formula which is
basically trend is equal to intercept
plus slope into time Cod and then we can
go and plot it see how it is looking and
therefore so we see here that the
predicted values are pretty close to the
actual values and um therefore we can
safely assume that our calculations
which are like our manual model is
working and hence we we go ahead and
predict for the fifth year so till four
years we know the actual value as well
so we can compare how our model is
performing and for the fifth year we
don't have reference values so we can
use our equations to calculate the
values or predict the values for the
fifth year and we can go ahead and
safely calculate those values and when
we plot for the fifth year as well the
predicted values we see that they are
pretty much they captured the pattern
and we can safely assume that the
predictions are fairly accurate as we
can also see from the graph in the Excel
sheet that we have already seen okay so
let's go and plot it so this is how the
plot looks this is the CMA or the
centered moving average the green color
and then the blue color is the actual
data red color is the predicted value
predicted by our handcrafted model okay
so remember we did not use any regular
forecasting model or any tool we have
done this manually and uh the actual
tool will be used in the next video this
is just to give you an idea about how
behind the scenes or under the hood how
fusting Works a Time series analysis how
it is performed okay so it looks like it
has captured the trend properly so up to
here is the known reference we have
reference and from here onwards it's
purely predicted and uh as I mentioned
earlier we can safely assume that the
values are accurate and predicted
properly for the fif so let's go ahead
and Implement a Time series forecast in
r first of all we will be using the
arimo model to do the forecast of uh
this time series data so let us try to
understand what is arima model so arima
is actually an acronym it stands for
autor regressive integrated moving
average so that is what is ARA model and
it is specified by three parameters
which is p d and q p stands for auto
regressive so let me just mark this so
there are three components here Auto
regressive integrated moving average
okay so these three parameters
correspond to those three components so
the P stands for auto regressive D for
integrated and Q for moving average so
let us see what exactly this is so these
three factors are p is the number of
autor regressive terms or ar we will see
that in a little bit and D is how many
uh levels of differences that we need to
do or differentiation we need to do and
Q is the number of lagged forecast eror
so we'll see what exactly each of these
are so AR is the number of Auto
regressive terms and which is basically
denoted by the p and then we have D
which is for the number of times it has
to be
differentiated and then we have q which
is for the moving average so what
exactly AR terms so in terms of the
regression model Auto regressive
components refer to the pr values of the
current value well what we mean by that
is here when we talk about time series
data focus on the fact that there is
regression so what exactly happens in
regression we try to do something like
if it a simple linear regression we do
some equation like Y is equal to MX plus
C where there are actually there are two
variables one is the dependent variable
and then there is an independent
variable let me just complete this
equation as well MX plus C right so this
is a normal regression curve or simple
regression Cur now here we are talking
about Auto regression or Auto regressive
so Auto regressive as the name suggest
is regression of itself so which means
that here you have only one variable
which is your maybe the cost of the
flights or whatever it is right and the
other variable is basically time
dependent and therefore the value at any
given time and that we will denote as YT
for example so there is no X here there
is only only one variable and which is y
and we say YT which is basically the
predicted value at a time interval T for
example is dependent on the previous
Valu so for example there may be A1 and
then YT minus one and then there will be
like plus A2 and right plus A2 and YT
minus 2 and uh all right and then plus
A3 into y T minus 3 cor right so
basically here what we saying is there's
only one variable here but there is a
regression component so we are doing a
regression on itself so that's how the
term Auto regression comes into play so
only thing is that it is dependent on
the previous time values so there is a
lag let's say this is the first lag
second lag third lag and so on so the
current value which is YT is dependent
on the previous time lag values so that
is what is auto regression component so
this is what is shown here for example
in this case instead of Y we are calling
it as X so that's the same and this is
represented by some equation of that
sort depending on how many lags we take
so that is the AR component and the term
p is basically determines how many lags
we are considering so that's the ter e
form now what is d d is the degree of
differencing so here differencing is
like to for the nonseasonal differences
right so for example example if you take
the values like this which are given for
5 4 6 and so on and so forth if you take
the differencing of one after another
like for example 5 - 4 or 4 - 5 the next
value with the previous value so 4 - 5
so this is known as the first order
differencing so the result is min -1
similarly 6 - 4 is 2 7 - 6 is 1 so this
is first order differencing and uh here
we call it as D is equal to one okay and
same way we can have second order third
order and so on then the last one is q q
is the actually by we call it moving
average but in reality it is actually
the error of the model so we also
sometimes represent as ET all right so
now ARA model works on the assumption
that the data is stationary which means
that the trend and seasonality of the
data has been removed that is correct
okay so this we have discussed in the
first part how what exactly is
stationary data and how do we remove the
non-stationary part of it now in order
to test whether the data is stationary
or not there are two important
components that are considered one is
the autocorrelation function and other
is the partial autocorrelation function
so this is referred to as ACF and pacf
right so what is autocorrelation and
what is the definition or correlation is
basically the similarity between values
of a same variable across observations
as the name suggests now how do we
actually find the auto corelation
function the value right so this is
basically done by plotting and
autocorrelation function also tells you
how correlated points are with each
other based on how many time steps they
are separated by and so on that is
basically the time lag that we were
talking about and it is also used to
determine how past and future data
points are related and the value of the
autocorrelation function can vary from
minus1 to 1 so if we plot this is how it
will would look autocorrelation function
would look somewhat like this and there
is actually a readily available function
in R so we will see that and you can use
that to plot your aut correlation
function okay so that is ACF and we will
see that in our R studio in a little bit
and similarly you have partial
autocorrelation function so partial
autocorrelation function is the degree
of association between two variables
while adjusting the effect of one or
more additional variables so this again
can be measured and it can also be
plotted and its value once again can go
from minus1 to 1 and it gives the
partial correlation of Time series with
its own lagged values so lag again we
have discussed in the previous uh couple
of slides this is how a PF plot would
look in our studio we will see that as
well and once we get into the r studio
and with that let's get into our studio
and take a look at our use case before
we go into the code let's just quickly
understand what what exactly is the
objective of this use case so we are
going to predict some values or forecast
some values and we have the data of the
airline ticket sales of the previous
years and now we will try to find the or
predict the or forecast the values for
the future years all right so we will
basically identify the time series
components like Trend seasonality and uh
random Behavior we will actually
visualize this in our studio and and
then we will actually forecast the
values based on the past values or
history data historical data so these
are the steps that we follow we will see
in our studio in a little bit just
quickly let's go through what are the
steps we load the data and it is a Time
series data if we try to find out what
class it belongs to the data is actually
air passengers data that is already
comes preloaded with our studio so we
will be using that and we can take a
look at the data and then what is the
starting point what is the end point so
these are all functions that are really
available we'll be using and then what
is the frequency it's basically
frequency is 12 which is like yearly
data right so every month the data has
been collected so for each year it is 12
and then we can check for many missing
values if there are any and then we can
take a look at the summary of the data
this is what we do in exploratory data
analysis and then we can plot the data
visualize the data how it is looking and
uh we will see how the data has some
Trend seasonality and so on and so forth
all right then we can take a look at the
cycle of the data using the cycle
function and we can see that it is every
month that's the cycle end of every 12
months the new cycle begins so each
month of the year is uh the data is
available then we can do box plots to
see for each month how the data is
varying over the various 10 or 12 years
that we will be looking at this data and
uh from exploratory data analysis we can
identify that there is a trend there is
a seasonality component and how the
seasonality component varies also we can
see from the box plots and we can
decompose the data we can use the
decompose function rather to see the
various components like the seasonality
trend and the irregularity part okay so
we will see all of this in our studio
this is how they will look this is the
Once you decompose and this is how you
will actually you can visualize the data
this is the actual data and this is the
Trend as you can see it's going upwards
this is the seasonal component and this
is your random or irregularity right so
we call it irregularity or we can also
call it random as you can see here yes
so the data must have a constant
variance and mean which means that it is
stationary before we start any analysis
time series analysis and uh without so
basically yeah if it is stationary only
then it is easy to model the data
perform time series analysis so we can
then go ahead and fit the model as uh we
discussed earlier we'll be using ARA
model there are some techniques to find
out what should be the parameter so we
will see that when we go into our studio
so the auto ARA function basically tells
us what should be the parameters right
so these parameters are the p d and q
that we talked about that's what is
being shown here so if we use autoa it
will basically take all possible values
of this PDQ these parameters and it will
find out what is the best value and then
it will recommend so that is the
advantage of using Auto ARA all right so
like in this case it will tell us what
if we use this parameter Trace we set
the parameter Trace is equal to true
then it will basically tell us what is
the value of this AIC which has to be
minimum so the lower the value the
better so for each of these combinations
of p d and q it will give us the values
here and then it will recommend to us
which is the best model okay because
whichever has the lowest value of this
AIC it will recommend that as your best
PDQ values so once we have that we can
see that we will basically we can
potentially get a model or the equation
model is nothing but the equation and
based on the parameters that we get and
we can do some Diagnostics we can do
some plotting to see how whether there
is a plot for the residual so which
shows the stationarity and then we can
also take a look at the ACF and PF we
can plot the ACF and PF and then we can
do some forecasting for the future year
so in this case we have up to 1960 and
then we can see how we can forecast for
the next 10 years which is 1970 up to
1970 and once we have done this can we
validate this model yes definitely we
can validate this model and uh to
validate the findings we use uh junkbox
test and this is how you just call box.
test and then you pass these parameters
and you will get the values that will be
returned which will tell us whether this
how accurate this model is how accurate
the prodctions are so the values of P
are quite insignificant in this case we
will see that and that also indicates
that our model is free of
autocorrelation and that will basically
be it so let's go back and into our R
studio and and uh go through these steps
in uh real time so we have to import
this Library forecast package is not
installed you have to go here and
install the forecast package okay so
that's the easy way to install rather
than so click on this install I will not
do it now because I've already installed
so the first time that's only one time
then after that you just have to load it
into memory and then keep going so we
will load this data called air
passengers so by calling this data
method and if you see the the data air
passengers is loaded here and if we
check for the class it is a Time series
data TS data so we can check for the
dates we can also view the data in a
little bit and start date is 1949 and
January and our end date is 1960
December and the frequency is 12 which
is like collected monthly so that is the
frequency which is uh 12 here and then
then we check if there are any um
missing values there are no missing
values and then we take a look at the
summary of the data this is all
exploratory data analysis and then if
you just display the data this is how it
looks and then we need to decompose this
data so we will kind of store this in an
object TS data and then use that to
decompose and store the new values let
me just clear this for now and and uh if
we decompose basically as we have seen
in the slides decomposing is breaking it
into the trend seasonality and irregular
or random components then you can go
ahead and plot it so when you plot it
you can see here let me Zoom this this
is our original plot or observed value
as it is known as then we have
decomposed the three parts which is
basically the trend as you can see there
is a for Trend then the seasonal
component so this is some regularly
occurring pattern and then there is a
random value which is basically you
cannot really give any equation or
function or anything like that so that's
what this plotting has done and then you
can actually plot them individually as
well so these are the individual plots
for the trend for the seasonal component
and the random component all right so
now let's take a look at the original
data and see how the trend is in a way
so if we do this linear regression line
it will show that it is going upwards
and we you can also take a look at the
cycle that are there which is nothing
but we have a frequency of 12 right so
the Cycles will display that it is
January February to December and then
back to January February and so on and
so forth and if we do box plots for the
monthly data you will see that for each
of the months right and over the 10
years that the data that we have we will
see that there is a certain pattern
right this is also in a way to find the
seasonality component so
while January February sales are
relatively low around July August the
sales pick up so especially in July I
think the sales are the highest and this
seems to be happening pretty much every
year right so this is every year in July
there seems to be a peak in the sales
and then it goes down and slightly
higher in December and so on so that is
Again part of our exploratory data
analysis and once again let's just plot
the data now as I said in order to fit
into an ARA model we need the values of
PD and Q now one way of doing it is
there are multiple ways actually of
doing it the earlier method of doing it
was you draw the autocorrelation
function plot and then partial Auto
correlation function plot and then
observe that and where does this change
and then identify what should be the
values of p and Q and so on now R really
has a very beautiful method which we can
use to avoid all that manual process
that we used to do earlier so what R
will do is there is a method called Auto
ARA and if we just call this Auto ARA
method and it will basically go and test
the ARA model for all possible values of
this parameters PDQ and then it will
suggest to you what should be the best
model and it will return that best model
with the right values of PD and Q so you
we as data scientists don't have to do
any manual you know trial and error kind
of uh stuff okay so we got the model now
and uh this is the model it has PDQ
values are 211 PDQ and this is the
seasonal part of it so we can ignore it
for now and so if we want to actually
understand how this has returned these
values 211 as the best one there is a
another functionality or feature where
we can use this Trace function or Trace
parameter so if you you pass to Auto ARA
the trace parameter what it will do is
it will show you how it is doing this
calculation what is the value of the AIC
basically AIC is what you know defines
the accuracy of the model the lower the
better okay so for each combination of
PDQ it will show us the value of AIC so
let's run it before instead of me
talking so much let's run this if we run
auto ARA with Trace you see here there
is a red mark here that means it is
performing it's executing this and here
we see the display right so it starts
with certain values of PDQ and then it
finds that value is too high so it
starts with a again with some 0 1 1 0er
and so on and so forth and ultimately it
tells us okay this is our best model you
see here it says this is our best model
211 let's go back and see did we get the
same one yes we got the same one when we
ran without Trace as well right now why
is 211 let us see where is 211 here is
our 211 and if you compare the values
you see that 10 17 is pretty much the
lowest value and uh therefore it is
saying this is our best model all other
values are higher so that's how you kind
of get your model and now that you have
your model what you have to do you need
to predict the values right so before
that let us just do some test of these
values so for that you install T Series
again if you are doing it for the first
time you would rather use this package
and install and say T Series and install
it and then you just use this Library
function to load it into your memory all
right so now that we got our model using
Auto ARA let us go ahead and forecast
and also test the model and also plot
the ACF and PF remember we talked about
this but we did not really use it we
don't have to use that but at least we
will visualize it and for some of the
stuff we may need this T Series Library
so if you are doing this for the first
time you may have to install it and my
recommendation is don't use it in the
code you go here and install
tseries and I will not do it now because
I've already installed it but this is a
preferred method and once you install it
you just load it using this libraries
function and then you can plot your
residuals and this is how the res
residuals look and you can plot your ACF
and PF okay so this is how your PF looks
and this is how your ACF looks for now
there is really nothing else we need to
do with ACF and PF this just to
visualize how that how it looks but as I
mentioned earlier we were actually using
these visualizations or these graphs to
identify the values of p d and q and how
that was done it's uh out of scope of
this video so we will leave it at that
and uh then we will forecast for the
next 10 years how do we focus that so we
call forast and we pass the model and we
pass what is the level of accuracy that
you need which is 95% and for how many
periods right so basically we want for
10 years which is like 10 into 12 time
periods so that's what we are doing here
and now we can plot the forast value so
you see this is the original value up to
I think 62 or whatever and then it goes
up to 72 this blue color is the
predicted value let's go and zoom it up
so that we can see it better so from
here onwards we focusing and you can see
that it looks like our model has kind of
learned the pattern and this pattern
looks very similar to what we see in the
actual data now how do we test our model
so we can do what is known as a box test
and we pass our model here residuals
basically with different lags and from
those values here the P values here we
find that they are reasonably low to P
values which means our model is fairly
accurate we'll be creating two
dashboards using a sample sales data set
so if you want to get the data and the
dashboard file that we'll be creating in
this demo then please put your email IDs
in the comment section of the video a
team team will share the files via
email now let's begin by understanding
what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards an advant AG of dashboards is
the quick detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first so here is the sales data set that
we'll be using for our demo so this data
set was actually generated using a
simulator and is completely random it
was not validated though we have applied
certain transformations to the data
using power query features so this data
as you can see has thousand rows so
using the simulator we had generated
thousand rows of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has 17 columns now let
me give you a brief about each of the
columns so first we have the region
column so we have Middle East and North
Africa there North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others similarly
we have the country names from which the
item was ordered the third column is the
item type so we have different items
Cosmetics vegetables there's baby food
cereal fruits Etc then we have the
representatives name or you can see this
as the customer name who ordered the
product then we have a sales Channel
column so there are basically two
channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date column then
we have the order ID the ship date next
we have unit sold
which is basically the total number of
units sold for each item then we have
the unit price column this is the price
at which each product was sold then we
have the unit cost column which is
basically the production cost for each
of the items next we have the total
revenue the total revenue is actually
the product of unit sold and unit price
then we have the total cost column now
the total cost column is actually the
product of unit sold and the the unit
cost similarly we have the total profit
column so total profit is the difference
between total revenue and the total cost
and finally we have created two more
columns that is order year and then we
have order month now these two columns
were actually generated using the power
query features so we use the order date
column which is this column and
extracted order year and Order
month so first we are going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate po tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
Fields now let's create our first report
to see the total revenue generated each
year so we need to create a poot table
for this and I'll click on a cell in my
data set and then I'll go to the insert
tab here we have the option to select
the pivote table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
click on okay there you go so we have a
new sheet where I can place my PO
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order ear column
under rows and then I'll select the
total revenue column under
values you can see I have my pwo chart
ready now if you want you can sort this
so from the data you can see we have
order Year from 2010 to
2017 now based on this data let's let's
create our pivote chart so I'll click on
any
cell go to insert and here you have the
option to select recommended charts I
click on this now actually I want a line
chart so I'll click on line here and
select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivote
chart now let me show you how you can
format this chart to make it more
readable so first let me delete these so
I'll right click and select hide all
field buttons on the chart so this will
delete the buttons present on the chart
now let me go ahead and edit the chart
title so the title I want is total
revenue I'll type it
down by
Year all right next let's do a few more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is gone
now let me add access titles so we'll
label our x-axis and y axis so here
under
x-axis I can write it
as
ear similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right
now let me select this chart Style
option and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color
okay and then let me go back to style
let's select a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
data labels you can see we have the
revenue for each of the years now this
is not readable at all so we'll format
this a bit
if I click on this Arrow here I have
more
options if I scroll down you can see we
have something called as number here
I'll expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here we'll give a format
code which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
a formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than let's say 9 lakh
999,000 let me make sure there are six
nines here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go I'll close the
bracket I'll give a
hash give two
commas so if the revenue is greater than
9 lakh
99,000 I'll put it in the format of
millions So within double quotes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another hash and
if the value is less than the desired
number it should be 0 million let me
click on add all right you can see how
nicely we have formatted our data and
you see here we
have added the new format which is in
millions all right now if you want you
can go ahead and adjust
the boxes let me move this a bit up I'll
delete this now if you notice this line
chart you can make a few conclusions for
example if you see here in
2010 the total revenue generated was
near 175 million now this came down to
150 million in
2011 then the revenue constantly grew
from 2011 till
2014 it reached 195 million and after
2014 it again came down to 180 million
and the revenue dropped significantly
between 2016 and
2017 in 2017 the revenue was just 96
million
now before moving ahead to my next chart
let me just rename this sheet so I'll
write it as
Revenue by Year all
right
now let's analyze the revenue generated
each year in different regions so for
this we'll create another P table let me
close this I'll click on any cell go to
insert and and select pivote table I'll
just click okay so that my pivote table
is placed on a new sheet all right now
this time we want the revenue by each
year and region so first of all let's
drag region to
columns
then let's drag the order ear column
under rows and then I'll select total
revenue onto values so here you can see
we have the pivot table ready so for
2010 you can see in Asia this was the
revenue
generated similarly if you see for
2013 this was the total revenue
generated in Europe and we have for
other years as well now let's create a
line chart based on this pivote table so
I'll select any sell in the pivote table
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
recommended charts from this list I'll
select my line chart and click on okay
there you go so we have our next pivote
chart
ready so on the right you see the
different regions that are present in
different colors let me just expand it
so that you can see all the regions we
have so in total we
have seven
regions and each of the regions have
been represented in different colors
so if you notice this
graph for the subsaharan African region
in
2012 subsaharan Africa made the highest
amount of
sales now from the sample data you can
also tell that the revenue for North
America has been significantly low
compared to other regions similarly if
you
see for Europe
this was the revenue Trend between 2010
and
2017 so if you see here in 2011 the
sales were at this level then it
significantly dropped in
2012 then in
2013 there was a huge Spike and then
again came down in 2015 and so on so you
can make your own conclusions by looking
at these line charts now let's
format this chart so first of all let's
delete the field buttons present on the
chart and we'll
also delete the Legend all right now let
me just reduce the size of the
chart next we'll add a chart title
so
we'll give the title as
Revenue
by year and
region
okay you can also format the y axis in
terms of
millions so I'll right click on this
axis and I'll select format
access I'll scroll down and here we have
the number drop down let me scroll again
under category I'll select custom and
will use this format that we created for
our previous chart there you go you can
see our access labels have been changed
in terms of millions now so let's close
this and let me save it now you can
reduce the font size or increase the
font size let me just show you suppose
you want to increase the font size of
the chart title so you just select it
and from here you can either reduce or
you can increase you can see now it's 12
if you you want you can make it 16
similarly you can also edit the access
labels also by selecting the chart title
you can also move it to left or right or
you can place it in the center as well
for the time being let me just keep it
to the left all right now we'll see the
revenue and total cost by each region
and we'll create a combo chart for this
so let me show you how to do it I'll go
to my data sheet I I have my cell
selected go to insert and click on
pivote table let me just click on okay
all right so for this I'll select my
region onto
rows and
then I'll
have two columns under values the first
one is going to be total revenue and the
next column will be the total cost
column all right so here we have have
the pivote table ready now based on this
pivote table let's create our pivote
chart so I'll go to recommended charts
and if you see below at the bottom we
have combo chart so this is the preview
of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay there you go so we have a nice
combo chart ready here now the way to
look at it is the bars represent the two
total revenue which is this
column now the line
represents the total cost so let me go
ahead and edit this chart a bit so first
of all let's delete the field buttons
all right and let's also remove the
legend from
here next we'll add data labels so I'll
click on data labels here okay so these
are the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
let's format the data labels in terms of
millions so I'll click on this Arrow go
to more options if I scroll down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I'll choose my type that is in
millions all right so you can see we
have formatted our data next thing we'll
add a chart title so here I'll write as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by
region before moving ahead let me rename
the sheets as well I'll write Revenue
menu
and total
cost
similarly sheet three also I'm going to
rename it as
Revenue
by year and
region so this makes your sheet more
readable all right now moving
ahead next we are interested to get get
the revenue generated by order priority
and for this we are going to create a
pie
chart so let's go to the data sheet and
create our P table first I click on okay
now I'll select order priority under
rows and under values I'll select total
revenue so this is a very simple pivote
table so you have your order priority so
C is for critical h is for high L is for
low and M is for medium now based on
this let's create a p chart so I'll go
to recommended charts and here you have
pie chart I want to select this 3D type
of pie chart and I'll click on okay all
right so we have our pie chart ready let
me just resize it and from here I'll
remove the field buttons and I also
don't need the legend so I'll delete
this as well
all right now let's give a chart title
so this is going to be Revenue
by order
priority now let's add our data labels
I'll check this
option okay now let's again format this
in terms of
millions so
here I'll click on the last option I'll
go to numbers under category I'll select
custom and my type is going to be in
terms of millions there you go let me
close
this I will just move this to the
center all
right now if you want you can change the
color of the text as well so let's have
it in white color and see how it looks
okay so this looks pretty decent
cool
now moving to our next
report so this
time we are going to find the total
revenue by countries so we have multiple
countries present in our data set we
want to visualize the revenue generated
in each country so for this we are going
to create a horizontal bar chart so let
me show you how to do it but before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
Revenue
by I'll just put op which stands for
order priority all right now let's
create our horizontal bar chart I'll go
to insert click on P table and select
okay so I want my Revenue based on
different countries so I'll select
country and put it under rows and then
I'll choose total revenue and place it
under values so here you have the
different country names we have
Afghanistan this Albania let me scroll
down you have
Bangladesh there
are a number of countries you have Czech
Republic there's Estonia France Gabon
similarly if you scroll down we have
India there Jamaica Italy and all the
way to the bottom if you go we have New
Zealand the Netherlands Philippines
Portugal we also have
Singapore lots and lots of
countries we have the UAE United States
of America Zimbabwe and
others all right let me go up so based
on this pivote table let's create our
pivote chart so I'll go to insert and
select recommended charts from here I'm
going to select the column chart you can
see the preview here and let me click on
okay all right so here you can
see the different country names at the
bottom and the revenue for each of the
countries let's go ahead and edit this
chart so first of all I'll
delete the field buttons okay and let me
also remove the
legend here I'll write
Revenue
by countries
this going to be my chart
title
okay let's format this chart a little
more so I'll click on this option and
we'll select a new style let's
say I'll
select style six okay and let me now go
under colors and we'll select the color
of the bars so let's choose this color
okay so you have a horizontal column
chart
ready and at the bottom you can see the
different country names and we have
the
revenue
cool now let me go ahead and rename this
sheet so I'll write Revenue
by countries
and hit enter
okay and finally we'll create another
report which is going to be part of our
Revenue dashboard and this is revenue by
items so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have Cosmetics
vegetables cereal fruits the cloths
snacks households and other products as
well so let's check the revenue for each
of these
items so we'll continue the same drill
I'll create my poot table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item typee under rows and we'll
have the total revenue under values so
here on the left of the table you can
see we have the different item names and
then we have the total revenue so let's
let me just short this total
revenue from largest to smallest so you
can see here office supplies meet the
highest amount of Revenue followed by
household then cosmetics and fruits meet
the lowest amount of
Revenue I'll click on this go to insert
and select recommended charts this time
I'm going to create a bar chart so this
is how my bar chart is going to look
like I'll select okay all right now
let's format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be
Revenue by items
cool we also want to change
the color of the bars so I've have
selected all the bars I'll go to my home
Tab and here let's say I want to select
green color all
right I've edited my chart a bit
now
let's make
it
14 and I'll remove the
Bold okay okay here if you want you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items cool finally now it's time for us
to merge all the charts that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how you can create the dashboard
I'll create a new sheet and first thing
I'm going to do is I'll click on The
View Tab and uncheck grid lines so this
will remove the grid lines present in
the
worksheet next I'm going to insert an
image so we'll have a background image
on our dashboard so the way to do is
I'll go to the insert Tab and under
illustrations I have the option to
select pictures or insert pictures so
I'm going to insert picture present on
the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit
insert so this is going to insert an
image now let me just drag this image so
it covers a Fen of
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can
still expand this background image a bit
to the right
cool now the next thing
is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle and I'm going to name this text
box as
Excel Revenue dashboard
on
Sals
I'll centr line
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see shape
format here I'm going to expand this
shape fill and I'll select no fill so
my text box is transparent now and I'll
also remove the outline all right now
let me just double click on the title of
my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica bold and
I'll increase the size to let's say
30 all right I'll just drag the text
box I'll make the text as white instead
of black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select
pictures I'm going to
add this two pictures which is of a
store and a
cart to make it
look visually appealing so I'll place
the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place
the cart and the
store to the right as
well all
right
next the idea is
to bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
the dashboard so I'll hit control V to
paste
it and we'll resize this as well
all
right similarly let me bring in all the
other charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts our column charts the
combo charts the Spy chart and others
now let me go ahead and format these
charts a little more so you can see this
looks a bit cluttered so let's adjust
the labels let me bring this down
similarly I'll bring 190 million a
little
below all right this looks fine
now one more thing we are going to do
is we'll remove the white background
from each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart then I'll
right click and go to format chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here now
let's also remove the white outline that
we have so I'll select this chart go to
format and here I'll go to shape outline
and I'll select no outline you see this
so we have our total revenue by year
which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box so I'll go to insert and in
insert we have the option to create a
shape so I'll click on illustrations and
here I'll choose a shape and let me
select a rectangle so I'll just create a
rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose bring to
front and I'll place this
shape below it all right now the next
thing is to edit the shape so first I'll
change the color of this box so let me
select this blue color and and let me
increase the transparency so I'll right
click and go to format shape here I'll
increase the transparency let's keep it
to
25% or let's say
20% all right next thing we'll just
convert all the
font to white
color including the access labels the
chart
title will'll
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just adjust
our chart over
here next thing let's just remove the
outline so I'll go to shape outline and
I'll select no outline you see we have
now formatted our chart let's just pull
this a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to white color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back again
all right so now you can see on your
screens we have nicely formatted our
dashboard so I have added a few logos
for each of the charts you can see the
logos here so for Revenue by countries
we have a globe then if you see here
this is kind of a map or a
location similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the labels in terms of
millions if you look on the Y AIS even
the revenue for year and region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of millions so the way to do is
you can select this graph right click
and go to format
access here if I scroll down you have
numbers
and under category I'll select
custom then I'll select my type as this
format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our y AIS
labels all right so the next thing is to
add slicers and timelines to our
dashboard now slicers are used to format
your data based on a particular column
suppose if you want to see Revenue by
certain items you can add item as a
slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under fil we have slices and timeline or
if you go to the pivote Chart analyze
tab here also you have insert slicer and
timeline option so I select insert
slicer here first now it's giving me the
list of fields present in the data set
so I'll select country region and let's
say we want
to know by item type
and sales channel so these are going to
be my four slicers I'll click on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for Country slices and then for
item type also we have all the items
that were present in our data set now
moving ahead we need to connect all the
slicers to a dashboard so what I'll do
is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we
created you currently see only one of
the pivote table is selected so we need
to select all the pivot tables so let me
check all the P tables present in this
workbook and click on okay all right now
that we have connected one of our
slicers we now connect the other
remaining slicers so I'll right click on
this go to report connections and I'll
check all the pivote tables present in
this worksheet click on okay similarly
let's do it for the country slicer I'll
go to report connections and let me
select
all the pivot
tables and finally we have the item type
so I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
P
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit so I'll
place my pivote
tables to the
right I'll just reduce the size
let me scroll
down I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my final slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a timeline
all right now I have arranged all my
slicers so let's say you want to find
the revenue that was generated for an
item type let's say beverages so you can
just select beverages here and all your
charts show the respective revenues so
you have the total revenue by year for
beverages
only similarly here you can see the
revenue by year and region only for
beverages item type if I scroll
down now this chart represents the
revenue that was generated in each of
the countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck
it all
right let's say you want to
see the revenue generated for a country
like India so I have selected India here
and now you can
see my graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated based on sales channel
so we have two sales channel that is
offline and online suppose you want to
know the revenue generated offline so
I'll just select offline you can see the
values have changed so these were the
revenues generated for each of the items
only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions
so this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard code on sales we created
multiple charts and graphs then we
applied different formatting we added
different icons then we formatted the
labels also next we added slicers and
finally we saw how we could filter our
data based on these
slicers likewise now we are going to
create a profit dashboard based on the
same data so before moving ahead let me
re name this sheet as Revenue dashboard
I'll write
R dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our P tables and po
charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivote table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart
to visualize the profit for each year so
I'll drag my total profit column to
values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our pivote table ready now you can sort
this data to get an idea as to
which year had the highest profit and
which year had the lowest profit so from
this pivot table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order so
2014 had the maximum amount of profit
and 2017 had the least amount of profit
I'll just do control Z to undo it all
right now based on this pivot table let
me go ahead and create my pivote chart
so I'll go to recommended charts and
click on a line chart so this is the
preview of the chart I'll click on okay
let me close this so
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete
this let's do some more
formatting so I'll go to
style and
this
time I'm going to
select my style type okay and if you
want you can choose the colors as well
for the time being let's have this
yellow color next let me add the data
labels so again if you see here this is
not formatted properly so let's go ahead
and format
the data labels so I'll click on
number and I'll select custom
here and the type I'm going to select is
in millions and I'll click on close so
here you can see we have
our line chart ready which s total
profit by year let's rename this sheet
as
profit
by Year all right now let's let's move
back to our data sheet again next we are
going to show the total profit by
countries for this I'm going to create a
map so let me first create my pivot
table so I'll go to insert and I'll
click on pivot
table let me click on
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under rowes and then
I
have my total profit under values
the next thing I'm going to do is I'll
just rename the row labels as
countries and then I'm going to delete
the grand total which you can see at the
bottom so here we have the grand total
let me just delete the grand total so
I'm going to select this P table go to
the design tab here we have sub totals
and Grand totals I'll switch off the
grand total let me just verify it again
I I'll scroll down you see the grand
total has gone now all right now we want
to create a map out of this the way to
do is I'm going to select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here using this data I can
create my field map now so I'll go to
insert here we have the option to create
a field map there you go you can see see
we have our map ready I can expand this
now as you can see our map has a color
scale which comes from light gray color
to dark blue color so the countries that
are in Gray or you can say light blue
have the lowest amount of profit while
the regions or the countries that have
been shaded
in dark color a dark blue color have
highest amount of profit I will go ahead
and delete this
scale okay next we need to connect this
map to the original data source so what
I'll do is I'll right click on this map
and I'll go to select data here instead
of the previous range I'll give my new
Range now so my new Range will be my
original P table that I had
created go on top and click on okay so
we have our map ready now now if you
want you can change the color of the
shade so I'll just go to colors and
let's say we'll keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on next we want to create
a pivote table that will show us the
profit by year and sales channel so for
this we are going to create another line
chart so I'll go to insert and click on
pivote table so I'll select new
worksheet here since I want to know the
profit by year first of all I'll drag my
order year column to rows and then I'll
choose my total profit column under
values next I'm going to select my sales
Channel under columns there you go so we
have our pivote table here based on this
pivote table let me create my peot chart
so I'll go to recommended charts and I'm
going to create a line
chart I close
this you see here based on this chart
you can tell the profit generated with
online sales were actually lower than
that of offline so here the Blue Line
represents offline profit and the Orange
Line represents Online Profit if you
Mark Clearly in year 2012 the Online
Profit was actually higher than the
offline profit so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so we'll delete
the field buttons I'll also delete the
legend for now let me go ahead and add a
chart title so I'll write
profit
by year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
profit
by
countries similarly
let me rename this sheet as
profit by year and let's say SC for
sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivot table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only so this
is going to be a simple pie chart so
I'll first go to insert click on pivot
table and click on okay
so I'll drag my sales Channel under rows
and then we'll have the total profit
column under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other types of pie charts we
have okay so I'm going to select a donut
chart here I'll click on okay let's edit
this chart I'll remove the field buttons
let me now remove the legend as well
I'll just resize it and this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay let's also
add data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this
label I'll select the category as custom
and my type will be in millions okay let
me just move
this to the
left and this to the right
okay let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit by
let's say see which stands for sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my total profit under
values and we'll also have the revenue
column so I'll put my Revenue at the top
then I'm going to
select item type under row so here is my
pivote table based on this pivote table
let me now create a combo chart so you
can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this first let's remove the field
buttons
let's also
remove the legend
here then we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit by
items okay if you want you can also go
ahead and change the color of the bars
so let let me just
select one of these colors
okay all right so we have our five
reports ready that we are going to use
for our profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building our
dashboard so I'll click on a new sheet
let me just rename this as profit
dashboard all right we'll continue with
the previous drill so first of all let's
go to the view Tab and remove the grid
lines now we'll insert a background
image like we did for our Revenue
dashboard so I'll go to insert under
illustrations I'll click on pictures and
select this device I'm going to have the
same background I'll click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a
picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right now let's copy the title of my
profit dashboard so here you can see I
have brought my Revenue
dashboard and I'll copy the title and
the logos that be used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to
be
Excel profit dashboard instead of
Revenue now we'll copy each of the
charts that we just created for example
the revenue and profit by items then we
had profit by sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it
here and later on we can make the
adjustment copy this as
well similarly I'll bring the other
three charts onto my sales
dashboard okay so here on my profit
dashboard I have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I've reduced
the size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we ALS also did
for the revenue dashboard first let's
remove the white background from all the
charts so I'll select the first chart
I'll right click and I'll click on
format chart area here under fill I'll
select no fill next I'm going to remove
the grid lines so I'll just delete it
let me close this now we also have a
outline so I'll go to design
actually format and I'll remove the
outline next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here okay and let me
just select the chart and I'll bring
this to front and I'll move
this to the back
next I'm going to change the font color
all to White so that it's clearly
visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the x-axis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready the same I'm going to do for the
rest of the
charts okay so now you can see here I
have formatted all my charts I've also
added a blue background
you see here I have also formatted the Y
labels in terms of millions which is
actually the profit similarly here I
have added the data labels this is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red represents online
similarly here you have the Legends I've
also formatted the map as well okay now
the next thing is to make this dashboard
more interactive so we'll add our
slicers as well as timeline first let me
show you how to add a timeline so I'll
select one of the charts and I'll go to
insert under insert I have the option to
create a timeline so I'll
just click on
timelines so timeline is actually based
on date columns so since in our data set
we only have two date columns one is
order date and one is ship date so Excel
has only shown us two columns so I'm
going to create my timeline based on
order date so I'll select my order date
column and I'll click on okay you can
see here this is called a timeline I can
expand this now this timeline is based
on months now and if I scroll this
timeline you can see here I have my
order year 2010 and I have all the 12 12
months similarly we have for 2011 then
we have for
2012 all the way till
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till
2017 let me just squiz this and I'll
place it somewhere here on the
right now let me go ahead and create a
few slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on
slicer you can see it gives me the list
of columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create region let me
also select
country let's say I
want the representatives name or the
customer name and I'll click on okay so
here I have created three slicers
let
me first resize it and I'll place
it on the
right similarly I'll place the country
column
also then we have the region
slicer I'll resize this and I'll bring
it here okay the next thing we need to
do is I have to connect all the the
slicers and the timeline to the pivot
tables for the profit dashboard so I'm
going to click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivote tables that are
related to
profit so here I have selected four and
I need one more which is p table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region filter to
all the pivot tables so I right click go
to report connections here I'll choose
all my pivote tables which are based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the country slicer as
well click on okay and similarly I'll
connect my timeline as well I'll go to
report connections
and I'll
select all the pivote tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the P charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective pivote
tables that are based on
profit click on
okay now let me just bring it here all
right the next thing I want to show is
how are we going to use the timeline
first so you see we have all
the years here from 2010 to
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the year
2012 so I'll just click on this range
and now you can see our charts only show
information for 2012 so this dot
represents that was 51 million profit in
the year 2012 similarly you can see
here the profit by sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in
2012 if I scroll down you can see the
revenue and profit by items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can
see our profit by year and sales channel
for offline and online you can see the
map or the line chart for total profit
by year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in
2013
similarly our map has also changed now
this is a sort of an information that we
have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted all right so this is how you
can use a timeline now as I said we
checked by years you can also see it for
months and quarters as well
let me just uncheck
it I'll send it back to the place where
it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam Churchill this is
the profit generated by Adam
Churchill similarly
you can select multiple persons as well
suppose you want to see the profit by
different countries so you can use the
country slicer let me just bring this to
the middle and let's expand our chart a
bit okay so here you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for all the items
that was sold in United Kingdom so you
had beverages cloths household office
supplies you can see clearly office
supplies item meet the highest amount of
profit in United Kingdom now you can
also select multiple countries let's say
I want to know for France as well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United Kingdom and France selected
and the other charts present in my
dashboard change accordingly now I have
my
country selected as India you can see
the map of India
here and these were the respective
profit values now one thing to note here
is this is actually not Millions this
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as thousand and not in
millions even for this this is actually
K and not million all right so we have
successfully
created our second dashboard that is on
profit let me just resize this a bit and
we'll place it where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
poot tables and poot charts and then we
formatted our poot charts based on our
requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes so here you can select
different themes currently we are with
the office theme now let me just select
another theme let's say faet you see the
colors have changed and it
looks really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and S select
whatever theme suits the best all
right now let me just move back to my
Revenue dashboard and see how it looks
there you go so since we changed our
theme even our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects
all right so in this demo we saw how to
create a revenue dashboard so we created
line charts this combo chart P chart
horizontal and vertical bar charts and
then we learned how to add slicers and
connected to different P tables and we
filtered our data to see Revenue as well
as profit by items by countries by
different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map and lots
more we will learn some of the important
features and functionalities of power
Query in Excel also we'll be doing an
extensive Hands-On demonstration using
various data sets so if you want the
data sets and the demo files then please
put your email IDs in the comment
section of the video I'll team will send
you the files over email let's
begin so what is Excel power query
power query is an advanced feature of
Microsoft Excel that allows you to
prepare your data for analysis you can
perform numerous text computations and
numerical analysis to make your data
more powerful and informative Excel
power query is a data preparation and
transformation engine it allows you to
carry out the extract transform and load
operations on the data sets from
multiple sources now let's look at the
challenges solved by power
query earlier in Excel there was
difficulty in data connections Now using
power query you can connect to a broad
range of data sources such as relational
databases web files text CSV Json files
and even fetch data in the cloud volume
variety and velocity are the
characteristics that define Big Data it
was a major problem to handle such data
now power query enables you to transform
your data to an appropriate size it also
allows you to work on any shape of data
from any source
earlier updating your data and
refreshing it in real time was an issue
using power query a repeatable process
query is adopted to update the data in
real time and in the
future in Excel it was not so easy to
reape transform and manipulate data but
using power query provides a highly
interactive experience and sophisticated
tools to prepare your data
now from Excel 2016 onwards power query
on Windows has been fully integrated
into into Excel but in Excel 2010 and
2013 for windows power query is a free
addin you can go ahead and download the
link once installed the power query tab
will be visible in the Excel ribbon now
coming to the features of power query so
Excel power query allows you to clean
transform manipulate and process your
data for analysis it helps you to
automate repetitive task that you want
to do it over and over again you can
search for data sources and make
connections as and when you want Power
query helps you to prepare and shape the
data in the right format for performing
analysis and finally once your data is
ready you can share your findings or use
your query to create interactive reports
and
dashboards now let's have a glance at
the demo that we are going to work on in
this
video so we'll look at how to load data
from different
sources you will understand how to
extract tables from web files so we'll
extract tables present on Wikipedia
Pages then you'll learn how to sort and
filter
data up next you'll see how to group
your data how to split a column into
multiple columns and then pivote and
unpivot your
table then you're going to work on date
columns and make some
Transformations understand how to append
tables and merge tables vertically and
horizontally now let's open msxl and
start with importing a simple text file
so you can see here I have my Excel file
opened and in the middle you can see I
have my employee txt file now this is a
comma separated file meaning that the
values are separated by commas as you
can see it here the columns have been
separated by commas and all the values
have a comma between
them now this text file has information
about the name age company and the city
to which the employee belongs to let's
see how easily you can import this EMP
text file into msxl here I'm using Excel
365 or Office 365 where power query on
Windows has been fully integrated into
this version of excel so what I'll do is
first let's go to the data Tab and you
have this section called get and
transform data so I'll click on get data
under get data I'll go to from file
and select from text SL
CSV once I click on it it will ask me to
give the location where the file is
there so my file is on desktop I'll
click on power query files and here you
can see I have my employ txt file you
can see the type here it says text
document click on EMP and hit
import now this will take some time to
import the file onto Excel
it's establishing a connection you can
see there you go so here you can see the
file name em. txd you can see the file
origin as I said the D limiter is comma
and we have the data type detection and
here you can see we have our text file
so Excel power query feature has
automatically detected the column names
so we have name age company and city as
our columns and these are the values now
let's hit
load so this will load all the rows and
the columns onto
Excel there you go it was really quick
Excel has automatically loaded our text
file now you can see here we have
another tab called queries and
connections so we have made one query
and have loaded the employee data it
gives a preview also you can see it here
and if needed later you can go to edit
and change some values that we'll see
later now you can use this data to
create simple
visualizations so let me show you how to
do it so let's first select the data and
we'll go to the insert tab under insert
tab I'll click on recommended
charts let's say I want to know how many
employees belong to a particular City so
I'll click on the second chart which
says is the count of Name by City And
I'll click on
okay here you can
see we have a nice clustered bar chart
and you can see in Bangalore there were
five employees in hyad we had two and in
nask we had one you can see the count
here this is a pivot
table if you go back to our actual data
here you can see in Bangalore we had
Vidya sonum
ainash vun and himani and there were two
more people from Hyderabad and one from
nask so you can use the Excel power
query feature to import data onto Excel
and make some
visualizations now if you want to fetch
some data that is present on the web or
on the Internet Excel power query
features and functionalities can help
you import those data as well we will
now see how to import data specifically
a table that is present on the web here
I'll be using a Wikipedia article on the
list of European Cup and UFA Champions
League finals let me show you the page
first so this is my Wikipedia page on
the list of European Cup and UFA
Champions League finals if I scroll down
you can see all the details here and I
would like to import this table which
has the list of all the finals so we
have columns like season winners score
line Runners up venue and attendance
let's import this table onto
Excel so I'll copy this URL first now
let me open a new sheet I'll go to sheet
one and then on the data tab under the
get data section I'll go to from other
sources and here I have from web which
allows me to import data from the web
either you can follow this path or or if
you see here there's an option to get
data from the web if I click on
this it is asking me to enter the URL so
I'll paste the URL of the Wikipedia page
here and let's click on
okay now it's navigating and okay you
can see Power query feature in Excel has
given us a list of tables which you can
see here we have something called as
document there's a key table and here
you can see there's one table which was
extracted from the Wikipedia page and
the table which I am interested in is
this table which has the list of
European Cup finals you can see it
here Excel power query feature has
automatically detected these rows and it
has given
a list of columns as well you can see
these are the columns
now we'll explore the transform data tab
present in the power query now if I
click on transform data it will take me
to the power query
editor Let me just click on refresh now
this is the most important
section using the power query editor you
can clean your data filter your data
manipulate your
data and make it ready for
analysis now let's explore a few tabs
available here so we have a Home tab
that has a query section you can see you
can reduce rows manage columns sort the
data transform the data combine
different
tables now there's another tab called
transform which allows you to select
your data type transpose your rows and
columns pivote and unpivot your columns
and here you can see you can find out
some summary
statistics and you you can manage your
date values as well now if you want to
add some new columns to your data you
can do that as well and you also have a
view tab now
here if you see the first two rows the
values are the same you can see season
season these are all repeated which we
actually don't need and these are pretty
similar to our column names similarly if
I scroll down down you see there are
some
rows which have null values so actually
these rows do not add up any value or do
not add any value to our data so we'll
clean this data
first so let's see how to do it now if
you want to remove certain rows in the
table what you can do is go to the Home
tab and under reduce rows click on
remove rows and then choose remove top
rows if I select remove top rows it will
ask me how many rows do you want to
remove from the top you can see it here
I'll give I want to remove the top two
rows now let's click on okay you will
see that the Excel power query editor
has removed the first two rows and on
the right you can see the steps that
were
applied you can see it here
previously we had these two rows which
were redundant and once we applied the
step it has removed the first two rows
similarly let's go down and remove the
last 1 2 3 4 5 so we are going to remove
the last seven rows from the
table so again I'll go to reduce rows
and click on remove rows now this time
I'll select remove move bottom
rows and here I'll
choose I want to delete seven rows from
the table from the bottom I click on
okay if you
see the last seven rows have been
deleted now let me show you the last row
which is this one so the last season of
ufi Champions League was held in 2020
which is this year and Bayern Munich won
the Champions League against a French
team that was Paris St Germans by a
score of
1 now if you see the last value that is
the
attendance you can see the value is zero
which means there were no Spectators in
the stadium it was because of the covid
conditions now let's do some more
manipulation to our data suppose this
time I want to add a new column let's
say a stadium name by extracting values
from the venue column so let me just
show you the venue column so this is our
venue column so the first value is the
stadium name then we have the city in
which the stadium is there and finally
we have
the country name so I want to extract
only the stadium name so you can see we
have some stadiums like Santiago
bnab there's bemble
sanso and other stadiums so I want to
extract only the stadium names so let's
see how to do that I'll click on the
venue colum and go to add column tab
under add column here you can see we
have extract if I click on this drop
down there's an option to select text
before D limiter so if I choose text
before D limiter here I'll give my D
limiter as comma so everything before
the first comma will be considered as
the stadium name now let me click on
okay now here you can see under applied
steps it says
inserted text before D limiter if I
scroll to the right you can see the last
column has our stadium names let me
double click on this and change this to
stadium name
column and hit enter
even this step is applied here you can
see renamed
columns
similarly let's explore a few more
features now I want to add a new column
called stadium city so if you consider
this venue column whatever is there
between the two commas is the stadium
city for example Cent bernabo is in
Madrid similarly Wembley Stadium is in
London sanso is in Milan so these midal
values I want to extract into a new
column called as stadium city so let's
see how to do it so I'll click on the
venue column and go to extract and again
I'll select the extract Tab and here now
I'll choose text between D
limits and my first D limiter I'll give
is a
comma and a space you can see here all
the values have a comma and a space and
my end delimiter will be another
comma then I'll click on okay this will
add a new
column to the extreme right of the table
you can see here we have text between D
limits and it has extracted the stadium
city let me go ahead and rename this
column as
stadium city and hit enter you can see
the applied step
here
now I want to split the score column
into two columns so here we have the
score column
and the left value presents the number
of goals that were scored scor by the
winning team and the right value
presents the number
of goals that were scored by the losing
team so here I'll split the column into
two columns as winner score and loser
score so what I'll do is Select this
column and go to the Home tab under the
Home tab we have split column I'll
select split column and then choose by D
limitter so automatically Excel power
query detects that this Dash is my
delimiter and I'll split at each
occurrence of the
delimiter let's click on
okay now you can
see the score column has been split into
two it has renamed the column as score
do1 and score
do2 what I'll do is I'll go ahead
and we'll rename this column as winner
score and this will rename it to Loser
score I'll hit enter and I have renamed
it
successfully next let's change the
winners team and the runners up team
values to uppercase so suppose I want to
change all the values or the club names
of the winners team to upper case so
what I can do is I'll select this column
and go to the transform tab under
transform tab I have this option called
format so here I'll click on format and
then you can see I can change the case
to lower case upper case capitalize each
word so here I want to make all the
winner teams as upper case I'll select
uppercase there you go we have
successfully converted all the winner
team names to uppercase similarly let's
do it for the runnner sub team as well
so here I have my runnner sub team I'll
go to the transform tab click on format
and select
uppercase now we saw how to do some
simple manipulation of our data so we
created a few columns split a few
columns now to save all this I have to
go to the Home tab and then click on
close and
load this will take some time and load
our data onto this Excel
sheet you can see here it's loading the
data this will take a bit of time there
you
go Excel power query feature has
successfully performed some
manipulations on our data some
calculations on our data and then it has
saved the final version and loaded it
onto Excel Now using this clean data we
can do some analysis let's say I want to
find the seasons in which the winners
team scored more than three goals so we
have a problem statement at hand where
we want to find the seasons in which the
winner team had more than three goals
scored so what you can do is select any
cell in this data and go to the insert
Tab and click on pivote table here I'll
click on existing worksheet and then
I'll give my location I'll place my
pivote table somewhere here and click on
okay all right
now since I want to know the seasons
I'll drag season on to row and I'll also
drag the winners team column onto
rows then I'll choose my winner score
under values here you can see we have
the P table
ready now we need to filter this table
bble to see all the winning teams that
scored more than three goals so what
I'll do is I'll select this winner score
column and place it under
filters and here you can see I have my
filter let me click on this drop down
and I'll select multiple items from this
multiple items I'll choose four 5 and 7
because these values are greater than
three and click on okay here you you can
see I have filtered my P table and to
the left you can see the season and the
winner team that had scored more than
three goals in the
finals all right similarly you can
perform some more analysis suppose I
want to know how many times Real Madrid
won the championship so let's see I'll
click on one cell in the data set go to
the insert Tab and click on P
table I'll choose existing worksheet and
give my location here let's say I want
to place my pivot table here and click
on okay all right so the question we
have is how many times have Real Madrid
won the championship so I'll
choose the winners team column and place
it under
rows and let's say We'll select the
winner score as well
and let's convert this winner score from
sum to let's say count and click on okay
and since I want to check only for Real
Madrid so what I'll do is I'll go to the
insert Tab and I'll insert a
slicer here I'll choose winner teams as
my slicer and click on okay and out of
this I want to choose only real Real
Madrid so I'll select Real Madrid you
can see it here Real Madrid have won the
championship 13
times okay let's say you want to
compress your data and remove
unnecessary columns without losing any
information you can do that using a
feature in the power query editor called
unpivot to perform this task we'll use a
sensus data of India from Wikipedia so
let me first show you the Wikipedia
page so this is my Wikipedia article
which says list of states in India
bypassed
population and if I scroll
down you can see it here there's a table
which says by past population from 1947
to
2011 so there are a few columns like
rank this state or Union territory and
we have population starting from 1951
till 2011 which was our last
census here you can see if I scroll
further there are nearly 29 States and
we have seven union territories so we
will extract this table and load into
Excel
first okay so let me click on a new
sheet and we'll follow the same drill
I'll go to my data
Tab and click on get data under get data
I'll go to from other sources and click
on from
web here it will ask me to provide the
URL link of the Wikipedia page so I'll
paste the URL here and click on
okay now once I have done that it will
load a few tables onto Excel you can see
there are a few tables here I'll click
on the first one so we have our table
here now let's do some transformation to
this
data this opens in the power query
editor okay I'll click on refresh
first this will take some time to
refresh the entire data okay we are done
now if you see this data
clearly the first row in this table is
not necessary at all because these are
our column names so we also have our
column headers already present so let's
go ahead and delete the first row so
we'll go to the Home tab under remove
rows I'll click on remove top
rows now I'll give my
number of rows as one so we want to
remove the first row only I'll click on
okay you can see the first row has been
deleted if I scroll
further I actually don't need the last
row as well which is the total so what
we can do is we can also remove the last
row from the
bottom so I'll select one click on okay
you can see the step has been applied
and and you don't see the last row that
was the total row
anymore so the task that I want to do
here is I want to
compress all these columns which are
basically the population
columns so I'll select my state or Union
territory column and go to the transform
Tab and here I have the option to
unpivot columns so so I'll click on this
drop- down and select unpivot other
columns you can see here the step has
been applied and all the population
column from 1951 till 2011 have been
unpivot if you want you can go ahead and
rename these columns let's say I'll
write it as population
column
and let's say this
is I'll rename it to total population
value
all right now we are done with our
preparation of data let's go to the Home
tab and click on close and
load now this will take some time to
load the data onto
Excel all right so we have our Census
Data here so first you can see rank one
is utar Pradesh and we have the
population start starting from 1951 till
2011 then we have for
Maharashtra if I scroll down you can see
the other states we have Tamil Nadu
Rajasthan this Karnataka if I scroll
further we have udisha this Telangana
Kerala now if you see here the
population values from 1951 till 2011
for the telengana state are all na which
means there was no data available now
this is because telengana was only
formed in 2014 so there was no census
for this
state let's continue with our demo and
let's explore a few more features and
functionalities of powerquery
editor now the next table we are going
to use is an adventure Works customer
table now this data set is provided by
Microsoft for practitioners who want to
learn powerbi Excel or similar
Technologies and want to do some
manipulation some calculation some data
analysis stuff so let me go to a new
sheet and let's import the adventure
Works customer data set it's a CSV file
onto Excel first so I'll go to my data
Tab and click on get data from here I'll
go to from file and
choose from text SL
CSV you can see it here in my power
query files folder I have my adventure
Works customer table I'll select this
and click on import
this will take some time to load the
data set you can see the preview of the
data set here so we have columns like
the customer key we have the prefix of
the customer name the first name the
last name of the customer date of birth
marital status if I go to the right we
have annual income total children
education level occupation and home
owner column as well so let's click on
transform data
here we'll learn a few more features of
power
query okay we have our data on our
powerquery editor so first what I'll
show you is let's change the prefix
column the first name column and the
last name column to proper case so you
can see it here the prefix first name
and last name columns are all in upper
case now if you want to change the
values to proper case just
hit control and select the three columns
and go to the transform tab under
transform tab you have
format so if click on format here you
can see we have lower case uppercase now
proper case is to capitalize each word
so I'll click on capitalize each
word you can see it here now we have
converted the prefix first name and last
name column into to prop case The Next
Step I'm going to show you is let's
merge all the three columns the prefix
column the first name column and the
last name column into one full name
column so what I'll do is I'll select
the three
columns and then let's go to add column
and under add column we have this option
called merge columns let's hit merge
columns okay
now it's asking you to give the
separator I'll select my separator as a
space and click on
okay okay so before click on okay I want
to change my new column name from merged
to let's see full
name and now let's click on
okay you can see here it says inserted
merged column and if I go to my right
you can see it here we have a full name
column now if you want to shift the
location of the full name column you can
do that as well just hold this and keep
on dragging to the
left this will move the
entire table to the right and you can
place it wherever you want so I want to
place it let's say
here
okay now actually I don't want all these
columns so let's delete it it so click
on this and I'll right click and click
on
remove you can see we have removed the
prefix column similarly let's remove the
other two columns you can either right
click and do or go to the Home tab and
then select remove
columns all right
now let's say we want to add a domain
name column from AWS customers by
extracting the character C between at
theate
and.com so actually I'm talking about
the email address from this email
address we want to create a new column
called as domain name for that we'll
extract characters that are present
between AD theate and doom so let's see
how to do it I'll select the email
address column and then I'll go to add
column under add column I'll click on
extract and this time we want to extract
between two D limitter Al so I'll select
text between D limits and I'll give my
starting d limitter as add the
rate and my end delimiter would be
Doom now let's click on
okay so this will insert a new column to
the extreme right you can see we have
our domain name let's go ahead and
change the column name to domain name
and hit enter
all right you can see the step has been
applied now we are done
with our preparation of customers table
let's just go to the Home tab and click
on close and
load so all the transformation that we
did in the power query editor will
reflect here so you can see we have our
full name
column and if you see we have our domain
name as well
okay using the power query editor you
can perform some statistical analysis
now let's explore those statistical
features for this we'll be using another
data set called Adventure Works product
data set again this data set is also
provided by
Microsoft so let's go to the new sheet
and here I'll go to the data tab click
on get data under from file I click on
text SL CSV here you can see we have
Adventure Works products I click on
import let's click on transform
data so we have our data loaded onto the
power query
editor the data is mostly clean so let's
not alter this data let's straight away
go ahead and explore some of the
statistical features that we have here
now let's say if you want to find the
total number of product names in the
product
table we have this product name column
and say if you want to find the total
number of product names in the table how
to do it so what you can do is click on
this product name column
then go to the transform tab now in the
transform tab you have an option called
statistics click on this drop down and
select count
values now this will open another
window that will return the total number
of products in the table you can see the
value here it says
293 now to move back to the query editor
we have to cancel this step here so
let's just click cancel or close we are
back again all right
right now let's say you want to
calculate the average product price from
the product table so if I move to the
right you have a column called Product
price so let's see what is the average
product price from the product table so
I'll select this product price column go
to the transform tab under statistics
I'll select average so this will give me
the average product price which
is 714
4373 you can consider any unit you want
let's say this is in
dollars again we have to cancel this
step to move
back
okay now if you want to find the maximum
and minimum product price you can do
that as well so let me select my column
product price and go to the transform
tab under the transform tab we'll click
on this statistic drop down and let's
say I'll select minimum so this will
give me the minimum product price which
is
2.29
similarly if you want to find the
maximum product price so select this
product price column go to the transform
Tab and then choose
maximum so this is the maximum product
price in the product table we have let's
cancel this
step okay now you can also round the
product cost cost and product price
column to two decimal places so if I
show you both the columns you have your
product cost and you have the product
price column you can see the floating
values of the decimal points are not
constant it's varying so let's limit it
to two decimal places what you can do is
Select both the columns and then go to
the transform tab in the transform tab
you have here
rounding I click on this drop- down and
select
round now here I'll give my decimal
places as
two if I click on okay you can see here
both the columns the product cost and
the product price column have been
rounded up to two decimal
places I can scroll down you can see all
the values have been rounded up to two
decimal places all
right now let's say you want to add add
a column called discount price column by
multiplying .9 to the product price
column and let's say you also want to
round that new column to two decimal
places so how to do
it so we want to give a discount of 10%
so I'll select this product price column
go to add column and then I'll choose
custom
colum here we'll write a
formula so I'll give my new column name
as
discount
price and my formula would
be I'll select product price I'll click
on insert and then I'll multiply this
product price by
0.9 so this will give me my 10% discount
on the product price and click on
okay you see here we have a new column
added which is Discount price
so if the product price is
34.99 if you give a 10% discount it's
31491 all right now the next question
was to change the or round the decimal
places to two so I'll go to the
transform tab under rounding I'll click
on
round let's say I'll give two and click
on okay so even this has rounded the
discount price column to two decimal
places now we are done with our
mathematical operation on this product
data set so we saw how to find sum
average count how to round of values how
to add a new custom
column so let's go ahead and close it
and load it onto
Excel you see here we have our new
product table added here and the last
column if you see it's the discount
column that we
added okay now it's time for us to
explore another feature so we'll use a
table called Adventure Works calendar
table which has basically a date column
and let's see how using power query you
can prepare that data as well and make
some manipulations some
calculations so let me go ahead and
import Adventure Works calendars table
again this data set is provided by
Microsoft
so I'll go to my new
sheet and I'll go to the data tab click
on get data and from here I'll click on
from text SL CSV and you can see I have
my calendar table here I click on
import now this will open in the query
editor you see here this data set has
only one column which is a date column
so let's click on transform data
okay now if you see here the first row
is actually the column name so let's do
the transformation here let's push this
as the column name so I'll go to the
Home tab and under Home tab you have
this option called use first row as
headers I'll select
this you see here we have the column
name as date
now before making any operation let's
see
if all the fields are
available you see here if I click on the
date drop down year month quarter week
day day everything has been shaded out
and I can't access this the reason is
the date settings are not correct so
we'll change the regional settings let
me show you how to do it so we'll go to
file and I'll select options and
settings and go to to query
Options under query options we have
something called as Regional settings
here under Regional settings we'll
select English United States instead of
English
India so I'll just scroll down and here
we have English United States and I
click on okay now once this is done I'll
go to my data type and I'll select dat
as my data type I'll choose replace
current okay now you can see my date
column has been formatted if I go to the
date tab you can see I have access to
all this now let's do some operations on
this date
column let's say you want to find the
earliest and the latest date from aw
calendar table or the adventure Works
calendar table so for you can do is
Select this column go to date drop down
under transform and here we have the
option of earliest and latest so if I
click on
earliest this will show you the last
date which was 1st of January
2015 let me close this similarly you can
see the most recent date I'll go to the
date drop down and click on latest and
you have 30 June 2017 as the latest date
I close
this now let's add a new column say d
name start of the week and others so
I'll select my date
column go to add column here under add
column I
have my option
to select the day name the week name and
others so I'll click on this date drop
down and under D let's say I want to
choose name of
D this Returns the D
name similarly let's
say I'll want to find out the start of
the
week you can see we have the start of
the week column or start of we column
now one thing to notice here
is in this power query editor the week
starts on a Sunday now suppose you want
to start your week on a Monday you can
do some Transformations on this formula
tab so here in the formula bar you can
add a one here to make sure your week
starts on a Monday so if I hit enter you
will see all these values will change
you can see it's 28 4 and 11 this will
become 29 5 and 12 let's hit enter you
can see see it here your start of the
week is on a Monday now there's another
method to make sure your week starts on
a Monday let's cancel this
step okay I have to insert it once again
so I'll go to date and here I'll choose
start of
week now the week starts on a Sunday so
one more method is
to add day do
Monday you can see automatically power
query is giving me a suggestion so I'll
hit tab to finish it and I'll hit enter
now you can see the values have changed
and our week starts on a
Monday now let's say we want to add a
few more columns like start of month
name of month start of year and the year
value so you can just click on the date
column or select the date column go to
the transform tab
okay not the transform tab let's go to
the add column Tab and here let's say
I'll choose year so we have all the year
values and
similarly let's say I want to know the
start of the
year now you can do a few more
Transformations let's say I want to know
the
month now here it gives us one which
means January that's February March and
so on and so forth
fourth let's say we'll do one more I'll
click on this go to
my
date drop down and here I'll choose
let's say I want to
know the day of
year all right now we are done with all
our transformation and preparing our
data on a date field so let me just go
to the Home tab I'll click on close and
load now this will load put
the data set onto Excel you can see it
here we have the data ready now you can
use this data to make some
analysis draw a pivote table draw a
pivote chart and do a whole lot of
things now while working on a project it
is possible that not all your data will
be in a single file it could be stored
in multiple files so it's important to
combine and bring all your data together
now we will see how to join your data
vertically I have my data present
present in a CSV folder so let me show
you the folder
first so this is my CSV folder let me
open it and I have some files these are
named as project 1 2 3 4 and 5 let me
open just one of the project files it
has a very small quantity of
data you can see it has a month column
and an amount column let me close
this and let me show it to you you again
let's open project
4 all the files have the same number of
columns you can see this also has a
month column and an amount
column now we'll combine all this data
together and load it into Excel let's
see how to do it so I'll open a new
sheet and I'll go to my data Tab and
click on get data then I'll go to from
file and this time I'll choose from
folder
now this will ask me to give the folder
location or the path location where my
CSV files are so I'll choose
browse and here you can see I have my
CSV file I'll just double click on it
and click on open now it has selected
my file path or the folder path then
I'll click on okay
you can see these are the files you have
project 1.
XLS project 2. XLS and so
on I'll click on this combine dropdown
and I'll hit combine and
transform now this will give you the
preview of one of the data
files you will see it
now you can see it here it says sheet
one okay
now it's processing all the data files
present in that CSV
folder and this will be uploaded onto
our power query
editor now you can see here on the power
query
editor all my data files have been
combined vertically here you can see the
month
column on the extreme right it's the
amount column and to the extreme left we
we have the source name or the source
file where the data came from so first
is Project one then we have project two
if I scroll down we have project three
files project 4 and similarly we have
project 5 now this is one way in which
you can merge your tables vertically so
we are done with it let's just go to the
Home tab and click on close and
load all the Transformations that were
applied you can see it here we have our
final
table and we have
successfully
combined five Excel
files again you can also join your data
horizontally this would be like an SQL
join where the data is present in
multiple files or sheets based on a
common key column you can join the
tables so you can perform a left join a
right join and inner join based on the
problem that you are trying to solve so
let's merge two tables based on a column
I'll show the data set first it's an
Excel file which has three
worksheets so here is my Excel file
which we'll be using to merge our data
horizontally you can see there are three
worksheets the first one is year 11
which has data regarding the student
name the gender of the student and the
course the student had opted for
similarly we have another for 2012 or
year 12 we have the student name gender
as well as the
course and finally we have a courses
table or a courses sheet which has all
the details regarding the course so we
have the course name the teacher who
teaches or teacher who taught that
course we have the lesson type the
number of credits and the assignment
type now we'll use this data sets to
load it onto Excel using powerquery
so I am on my Excel sheet let's just
open a new sheet I'll go go to the data
Tab and here I'll click on get data and
this time I'll choose from Excel
workbook and I'll select my file which
is students and courses I'll click on
import so we'll just see how to import
two tables and join them horizontally so
let me first select the courses sheet
and I'll click on transform data
now this has loaded the courses table
onto powerquery editor the table looks
fine we have the course column teacher
everything is fine now let's load one
more table and then we'll merge it so
here under the Home tab you have a
section called new source I'll click on
file I'll again select my students and
courses and click on import
and this time let's choose another table
let's say year 11 which has the column
name as student gender and course I
click on
okay now it has successfully loaded this
table onto power query
editor now if you say this the first row
is actually
our column names so I'll go to the Home
tab and select
use first row as headers so this will
push the first row to the column names
you can see we have done it successfully
we have my student name the gender
column and the course
column now let's merge it so if you see
here in the Home tab we have a section
called merge
queries let's click on this drop down
and select merge
queries here here I have my table which
is year 11 and let's choose one more
table that
is
courses now the kind of join I'll choose
as left outer join which means it will
take all the rows from the first table
and matching records from the second
table here I need to select the common
key column so if you see both the tables
we have the course column as the common
key column so I'll select this and now
you can see there's a tick mark which
means it has selected the rows and the
column successfully you can see it says
the selection matches 175 or 175 rows
from the first table and let's click on
okay let's just expand
this and click on
okay if I scroll to the right you can
see I have successfully merged both the
tables now if you want you can remove
unnecessary rows or columns suppose if
you see I have the course column from
the year 11 table and here also I have
the course column now this is redundant
let's just remove one of the columns
I'll just select this column I'll go to
remove columns and I'll select remove
columns
okay the rest looks fine we have
successfully merged both the tables by
using a left outer join let's just click
close And
load now this will take some time to
load our data onto Excel you can see it
here we successfully loaded it onto
Excel now we are done with our demo
part now let's just see what all we have
done in our demo so I'll go to my first
sheet here you can see we had imported a
simple text file first and then we
plotted
a graph which is a pivote chart then you
saw how to
upload a file from the web so here we
imported a UFA Champions League table
which was present on Wikipedia and then
we plotted some graphs and charts you
can see we made some analysis using
pivote
tables and then we imported another web
file which was based on a population
data and we use the unpivot option or
the unpivot feature in the power query
to reduce the number of
columns then we made some calculations
to our customer table which was from
Adventure works then we used another
table called the products table here we
saw some statistical calculations and we
added a column called discount price
where we used conditional
operations and then you saw how we
manipulated a date
column and then we saw how to append and
merge multiple
tables so on my screen you can see an
example Excel budget template theme so
on my screen you can see a column where
you have the debit amount so in the I
column we have all the deit amount what
we are spending for a month and on the
right column will be the balance amount
or the running balance of that for
example you can see that there is a row
number five where the debit amount is
8,000 for a jeans Levis and it is done
through UPI payment now if I change this
value of 8,000 to 4,000 something then
you can see that the running balance
will automatically change you can see
that currently the running balance is
73,000 and if I change this value from
8,000 to 4,000 then all the running
balances will change let's do that so
for that let's press
enter there you go you can see that the
number has been changed successfully and
all the values from the running balance
are also changed until the last day
which is the March
30th now how is this working and and not
just that you can see that we have also
included what is the total debit amount
in January and what is the running
balance that is the total available
balance after 1 lakh has been debited
into the account in the month of
February as February income now the
current available balance is
13,200 and the total expense in February
is 1 lakh
4,500 right how am I doing all this
looks so much interesting right now
let's do this practically so for that I
have already created a new sheet and I
have included all the data that we have
used previously the income of that
particular month and all the expenses of
that particular
month now without further Ado let's
begin to implement the Excel budget
template now our first step happens to
be converting all the data into a
natural table so you know that in Excel
all the data values are stored in the
form of a database by default so it
happens to be our duty to convert the
database type table into the pure table
type table so for that select all your
data and press contr T and there you go
we have an option to convert this data
into a table and remember to check this
particular check box and tell your Excel
that your table has headers so we do
have headers here so now press okay and
your table will be converted into a
natural table now let's type in the
formulas
so now let's select the cell
J2 and type in the
formula so what are we doing here is we
are trying to add the sum of G2 +
H3 so which is this particular cell and
removing I3 that is this particular
debit amount so this formula is used for
checking the running balance let's press
enter and there you go so it means that
you received 1 lakh rupees in the month
of January and out of that one lakh you
spend 15,000 rupees for something maybe
your education Lo or something and then
the remaining running balance out of 1
lakh Rupees is 85,000 rupees now let's
copy the same formula to all the sales
and there you go now the running balance
has been calculated for all the Cs here
now remember the monthly income
available balance and debit for January
and final balance now let's try to
calculate that for all the three months
so here we have three months that is
January February and March now let's do
a simple calculation to find out the
available balance of that month and the
total debit made by that person in that
particular month
the formula is really simple all you
have to do is use a sum function and
calculate the sum of all these
values and done
right there you go so the total expense
of the month January is
93,00 rupe now let's calculate the total
Duit of February month same formula that
is calculating the sum of
all the expenses made in the month of
February there now let's also calculate
the sum of all the expenses in the month
of March
done so we have the final values of all
the total expenses made in those
particular months now let's calculate
the final balance now I think I'm forgot
one important thing so before we
calculate the final balance we need to
find out the available balance that is
the available balance after 1 lakh
Rupees is credited into our account and
along with the the savings that you have
from your previous month right for that
we have a simple
formula now which all we doing is just
adding the uh income cell with the
balance cell that's
all so there you go now after crediting
1 lakh rupees and adding up the uh
balance of that particular month that is
we have 13,200 remaining from the month
of January and the month of February we
have income of 1 lakh so the total
amount is
11,3 no no no it is
13,200 yeah now we have the final
balance that is the difference between
the available balance and the debit made
in that particular month so in the month
of February we had a total balance of
13,200 and the total debit of 1
l4500 so the final remaining balance is
8,700 similarly the same formula has
been applied for the month of March and
the final balance we have is
37,300 so that's how you implement
budget template in Excel all simple
formulas and you have all the numbers at
your F temps so here I'll be discussing
some important questions that you will
come across when You Face interview for
Excel and uh we will start with the
basics the beginner l level and uh most
of them will be discussed here will be
the beginner level at the beginning and
then we'll discuss it at the further
level okay so the first question that
you might get asked is what is a cell
address in Excel so a cell address is a
combination of column letter and a row
number that identifies a cell on a
worksheet basically each cell will have
an Associated column number column
letter and a row number so you have to
keep in mind it will be always be a
column letter and a row number each
Excel sheet will have suppose for
instance if you take row five rows will
be in numbers and the columns will be in
letters column a column B column C
column D and so on and the numbers will
be for the row so for instance if you
take this particular uh cell cell
address is
D5 row column D and Row
5 so this is the cell address now let's
move on to the next
one now you will be asked what is
relative cell referencing and absolute
cell referencing in Excel so relative
cell referencing is usually the relative
references change when a formula is
copied to a another cell depending on
the destination row and column okay so
this is called relative cell referencing
absolute cell referencing irrespective
of the cell you know you don't have to
depend on the value of the cell
destination there is no change when a
formula is copied so this we I'll
explain it in the uh next Slide the
basic difference is this type of
referencing is there by default in Excel
relative cell referencing you just
insert the formula you don't need to put
a do dollar sign in the formula whereas
absolute cell referencing if you don't
want to change in the formula when it's
copied across cell then absolute cell
referencing requires you to add a dollar
sign before and after the column and row
address so see for
instance this is relative referencing
you know if you see this this particular
cell is having a we put the value as A3
B3 so what it will do is it will
multiply A3 and B3 and it will give the
product this is relative cell reference
whereas absolute cell referencing is
again the same thing but you have to put
a dollar sign before the column and the
row number so here you are specifying
this as A3 into B2 okay A3 into B2 and
it will give you you this particular
answer irrespective of that it will give
you it will calculate what is there in
this and it will give you the answer
okay now we move on to the next point is
basic question when you scroll across an
Excel sheet sometimes you have a header
on the first row and if you scroll down
you will not be able to see the first
row so there is a process uh or the
there is a trick to freeze the pains in
the Excel so you just need to have the
rows locked so how do you freeze pain
this is the question so what you need to
do is you need to select the view tab go
to the view Tab and go to freeze pains
it's a basic thing and you will see this
if you see here select the third row and
click freeze paines so you just select
this and click freeze paines
okay so you're going here and you're
going to the third row and you are going
to view Tab and you're selecting free
Spain so what happens is first two rows
will be locked okay these two rows will
be locked similarly for uh if you want
to freeze the columns okay it's the same
thing I am going to select this
particular column and then click on view
and then click free Spin so what happens
is the first two columns are locked A
and B will be locked and if I scroll
right you will always see the uh
customer name and category column so
these two we have locked and the next
will be scroll so this is the function
of freezing pains okay now coming on to
the next one and you will be asked and
you have an Excel sheet or a spreadsheet
and you want to restrict you want to
protect the data for from anyone or from
someone cop from copying the cell for
your worksheet so how do you do that you
need to select that particular data that
you want to protect and then click
control shift F and then you will see
the protection tab okay you just need to
go to the protection Tab and select La
okay and you will be asked to put a
password where and you will be getting
the review tab where you you need to
select the sheet put a password and just
save it so I will show you
across one of the examples here so this
is particular uh data that you have and
you need to protect you select it so
here as I said I selected it and then I
just press control shift F so here you
see the protection tab click the
protection Tab and then click cck select
and then uh locked and then click okay
and then you need to go to the review
Tab and then click on the protect sheet
and you are having the you need to
select this protect worksheet and
contents of locked cells so you
selecting these and you are protecting
the content and you just need to uh put
some
password okay and then click okay
okay so this is how you protect the data
on a worksheet and you are selecting
this area control shift F and just put
up a password and select lock sheet so
this is how you protect the sheet from
anyone to copy it the
cont now the next question that you
might be ask is what is the difference
between a function and a formula in
Excel so you will be asked this question
and you need to remember this formula is
like an equation which is typed in by
the user you are typing it suppose
A1 + B2 you are typing this formula in
one particular cell okay whereas
function functions are predefined
calculations it is like a formula which
is already there in Excel and you can
use it so as it says here it consumes
more time and it has to to be typed in
manually you this is as per the need
basis and this is particularly it's very
quick and very efficient you have
inbuilt formulas in Excel the sum and
multiplication product and various other
things that you will come across so this
is the basic difference between a
formula and a function in Excel okay the
now the next question that you might be
ask is uh or you need to know basically
is the order of operations used in Excel
while evaluating the formulas so what is
the order you need to remember this
acronym pad Mass p d m s or in other
simple terms you can use this also
please excuse my dear and Sally so these
are the acronyms p e d m a s now let's
see what happens first and you uh in
math when you do some calculations you
have order of operations okay Bard mass
is the one of the order of operations
now in Excel similarly in Excel when you
put up a formula you Excel will
calculated in a particular order and
this is called the order of operations
and the Order of Operations is first it
will calculate what is there in the
parenthesis it will perform this
function and then it will see if there
are any exponents in it and if it is
there it will do that calculation the
next and after that it will see if there
is any multiplication or division so p d
and then it will see there is any
addition okay and then the last one will
be the subtraction so Excel knows this
and you have to know this so that when
you put up a formula you will know what
is going to happen first and you will
not mess up with your formula okay this
is the order of operations it is one of
the important questions in the interview
for a beginner Excel level now the next
one is uh how will you write the formula
for following multiply the value in a
cell A1 by 10 and add the result by five
and divide it by two it is quite simple
okay see I'm just giving it an example
in this slide and you might be ask
something else so you will be given a
task to calculate or put up a formula
for this so when you are asked multiply
the value in a Cell of A1 by 10 so this
is particularly thing okay A1 is the
particular cell that is being given and
you're multiplying it okay you put it in
parenthesis and then add the result by
five so it will calculate the
parenthesis first okay and if it sees if
there are any exponents you have to
think in that way if there are any
exponents in it or not and then first it
will see the parenthesis and then
exponent there are no exponents here and
then it will do the multiplication and
then the addition and the division okay
so you will get this particular answer
and if you put it simply in this way
your answer is wrong because it will
multiply it into 10 add 5 and divide by
2 so you have to check which one is
right and you have to make sure that
you're putting the right parenthesis
okay so this is the formula here okay
the next question is uh there is a
different what is the difference between
count counter and count blank these are
three particular important things that
you need to these are similar but they
are quite different when you actually
see it okay so first we will see what is
count count is basically it counts the
number of cells which have numeric
values as the name suggest it is count
it will count the number of cells which
has numeric values okay if you see this
uh column and uh we at A1 we putting it
as count equals to A10 to A2 to A10 so
you're taking this range and you're
finding out what are the number of cells
which have numeric value if you see this
1 2 3 4 5 so five cells have numeric
values it counts the cells which has
numeric value and the next thing is the
counter okay what counter does it counts
the number of cells which has any any
form of content it can be anything it
can be a number it can be a alphabet it
can be anything it will see what are the
uh number of cells which has any form of
content okay for example this is the
same example we here taken here and we
have put the function as counter A2 to
A10 now see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so it sees
that there
are seven cells have some content in it
it is numbers and
letters it can be anything but it has
some content so count is the pension for
this now the next one is Count blank
okay as the name suggests it will count
the number of blank cells only so again
the same examples count blank A2 to A10
okay it will see what are the number of
blanks okay if you see this is blank and
this is blank so two cells are blank so
it will count the number of blank cells
only okay now the next one is uh what is
the shortcut to add a filter to a table
why do we use filter and it is one of
the basics uh function in the Excel
where you need to do some sorting and it
can be done by using a filter what is
the shortcut key it's very simple
control shift and L this is the key that
is used to put up a filter you just
press this control shift L all together
and you will find the filter and you can
sorted now the next question that you'll
come across is uh how do you create a
hyperlink in Excel so it's quite simple
there is a simple shortcut control K you
press these two together and you will
get the option you will select the it
will select the cell where you have to
insert the hyperlink hyperlink basically
it redirects to any other document it
can be a web page it can be a Word
document it can be another Excel sheet
or so on okay so these are the things
okay now another important questions uh
that is how to merge multiple
cells text strings in a Cell so how do
we merge the text strings in multiple
cells into one
cell there is one particular uh simple
function that you can use which is
called called as concatenate concatenate
function is used to merge text strings
present in multip
cells okay and uh it's a very simple
thing you just need to put this equals
to
concatenate and then if you for example
this is the formula concatenate text one
text 2 text three or this is concatenate
A1 comma B1 comma C1 this is the data in
our uh three cells Excel is one in A1 B1
and C1 so now if you want to put them
all in one and you can merge it in one
cell using the concatenate function and
it's very simple concatenate in
parenthesis A1 comma P1 comma C1 okay
and you will get it all merged in one
particular cell okay so this is how you
use the concatenate function and you can
also use the and operator to combine
cell values it is the same thing you can
use the and operator instead of commas
okay and I will show it to you in the
example
here okay now we have this I'll just
copy this thing
[Music]
to here okay and let's make it simple
and now I want to put this here
equals
con
concatenate and
A1 comma B1
comma c i just close it and I put enter
so you see this this all three the
different text is merged in one
particular cell and it will you can
perform various merge functions using
the concatenate function it's a very
simple thing and it is a frequently
asked questions in the interview okay
the next question uh it is very very
important one again and very basic as
well so how can you split a column into
two or more columns you have some
particular text or a sentence written or
data written in your cell or a column
and you want to put them across in two
or more or many number of columns so how
do you perform this F it's very simple
again you need to select that particular
cell so for instance we have it here is
India is a democratic country India
space is space a space Democratic space
country so the it's a different text
here and you want to split this
particular sentence into different
columns okay you need to select that
cell and then go to the data Tab and
then choose text to columns there will
be an option where you need to select
text to columns okay and you will see
this screen okay and you need to select
the choose the delimeter here and what
we are specifying here is uh first it is
says delimed and then we are selecting a
delimer as space because we see that
that is space here which is very Comm
and we want to split it so you will see
a preview here which shows what your
output will be like India in one column
is a democratic country so the datometer
is space here and T you need to select
this and then click next okay so you
will see the options select the columns
data format and choose the destination
now you see the data Pro and you need to
select the destination where you want to
put this output as and you select that
and then click finish and this one what
it does it it it splits the text into
multiple columns okay so you see this
you have selected this as the output and
it starts here India is a democratic
country so uh you will come across some
data which is you know huge and there
are spaces or OBS or anything that is uh
differentiated it with and you need to
put them in different rows or different
columns so this is the function uh that
you need to use to split the text into
different or multiple columns okay okay
the next uh question can be very simple
one or almost widely used in fact and
what is the use of v looka and how do we
use it so what is this particular thing
in Excel vook up function is used for
looking up a piece of information in a
table and extracting some corresponding
data or information so you have some set
of values in one particular column and
you want to retrieve or extract the data
corresponding to that particular column
or a cell in the whole sheet okay so the
syntax is is something like this it is
you need to go to one particular uh cell
where you want the output as and you
type the function V look up and you are
selecting the value where is the cell
exactly where you want the output to be
and you're selecting the table here and
the you're specifying the column index
and range look up so value this
indicates the value that you have to
look for in the First Column of for
table okay and then the table table
basically this refers to the table from
which you have to retrieve a value we
will show this in the example in the
next slide and the column index column
index it provides the column in the
table from which we are to retrieve a
value okay you will specify the column
index which one you are looking
for the next thing is range lookup which
is optional true
with uh if you put true it is
approximate match which is default and
false if it is exact match if you're
looking for the exact match so what is
the use of V lookup and how do we do it
okay so find the product related to a
customer name Richard okay you have this
sheet and in this one you want to see
what Richard has bought okay what is a
product that he has bought and you can
do this with the V looka function okay
so you just go here and you type in the
function V look up you're naming it as
Richard and first thing is the value it
is H4 okay and then the next thing is
the table okay table is A2 because this
is the table okay and you're looking for
customer name Richard okay and then
you're select in this the whole column
index which is E15 that mean you're
selecting this whole table then 15 okay
E15 you're selecting this and then the
next thing is optional which is giving
you the uh range lookup okay what it
does is it's optional it is you're
looking for an exact value or an
approximate by default it is approximate
math so how it performs the function
Okay so it gives you the answer as
scamer it goes and look ups for Richard
in this particular it will give you the
output here and the A2 is the table that
it will look for the customer name and
it will search for Richard and then it
will give you the output as cam now the
next thing will be we lookup different
from lookup function how different they
are weop lets the user look for a value
in the leftmost column of a table so so
as we've seen in the example it uh
allows you to look for a data in the
leftmost column of the table and Returns
the value in a left to right way okay it
sorts in left to right way where lookup
function lets the user look for data in
a row column and Returns the value in
the another row or column it will give
you the lookup fion in the next row
column okay not very easy to use as
compared to the lookup function okay as
we see uh it's a bit complicated when
you compare it to the lookup function
it's quite simple and it is used to
replace the V lookup function okay so
this is the different lookup and V
lookup function now uh Excel is
basically used for reporting mainly used
for reporting to management you have to
extract different kinds of reports and
what are the report formats that are
available in Excel this is one of the
uh important questions again uh for a
beginner level and there are three
formats basically compact form outline
form table form okay these are the three
formats that are available report
formats that are available in Excel okay
the next question is about a function
which is how does IF function work in
Excel okay the F function in Excel it
actually performs a logical test and you
will give a condition it performs the
test and returns a value if the test
evaluates to true and another value
which you again will specify if the test
result is false okay for instance we
have here a simple example which is
shown in the slide and what we doing
here is a written record is valid if age
is greater than 20 we have age here
specified and salary is greater than
40,000 else return the record is invalid
so we are giving two conditions and it
actually checks and evaluates whether
these conditions are met and it will
give you an output whether record is
valid or invalid based on the two
conditions that are specified okay and
F22 XIs which is this this uh column we
are specifying it should be greater than
20 and G2 to G6 which is the salary
column and we are specifying the
condition to be greater than 40,000 So
based on this two things it will check
and perform if these conditions are uh
met then it will give the desired result
okay so this is the function that is
used in Excel IF function okay the next
thing is sum IF function okay again the
sum IF function adds the cell value
specified by a given condition or a
criteria so so you are giving a
condition and you are actually doing
another function which is performing the
addition okay it will add the cell
values based on a condition again it is
shown here the total sum of salary where
salary is greater than 75,000 again for
example the salary column is G2 to G6
and we are doing a sum IF function what
the result will be it will perform the
addition of salaries which are greater
than 75,000 so it will see which values
are greater than 75,000 and then then
the the output will be it will be adding
these salaries which are greater than
75,000
okay now coming to the next uh slide we
will discuss another important function
counter and we'll find the data I result
based on the data that we have and the
function so we have a slide uh data here
and using the co data find the number of
days in which the number of death in
Italy has been greater than 200 okay
it's not uh shown here for some reason
but I will show you in the Excel sheet
okay so this is the data that we have
and we will try to find the function so
we'll use the counted function and count
function is again simple count if you
are specifying the column that is the uh
source that you're looking for that is
G2 the column G and it is two it starts
from two row two G2 till g357 which is
the end of the column and what you're
looking for is Italy you're specifying
it in codes Italy and then the next
column that it will look for is the E
column the number of cases okay here we
have the number of cases e22 again we
are specifying the range and what we're
looking for is number of cases which are
more than 20 so we'll perform this
function and it will show you the output
okay I'll show you to you in the Excel
so here is the sheet and I will uh try
to get the answer here and
uh
the so we performing
count F okay count
F and you're giving the
brackets parenthesis G2 which is the
countries column okay countries column
here who are specifying the whole range
3 5
7 it is Bally uh a long long list of uh
data and you're specifying the range and
what you're looking for is particularly
uh any country you can pick up like uh
Algeria
okay Algeria and and you specify it in
codes okay comma then what is the next
Target that you looking for is the colum
e where is it is mentioning the number
of cases okay so you specify the column
range for the number of cases which is
again e and
then uh the three 5 7 I mean it's a
basically long list of data that you're
looking for and then you are what is the
condition that you want to know and you
have to specify it at course and what
you're looking for is number of cases
which are more
than and you hit
enter okay so it give you the output as
143 so there are 143 days in which the
number of cases were more than 20 so
let's uh refine our search further let's
see 30 and it gives 140 so another
example that you you can take is let's
pick
Afghanistan Afghanistan and so there are
11 19 days that uh you will see the
number of cases where more than 30 and
this can be done with the count if
function so the next question is uh
about the pivate table so what is a
pivate table it's basically is a summary
of table of the data set I mean the data
that is there that can be you know
multiple number of rows and columns
which has different uh data that has to
be uh that is there in the reports and
you need to analyze those Trends and you
need to create a report and basically
present it to the management or in a
presentation so PV table is a summary of
table you know whatever data is there
you can put it in a summarized format
they are useful if if you have long rows
or column that hold values you need to
track okay so you have long list of data
and you need to summarize it and put it
in
a presentation or a you need to track
the values so it's very simple you have
to select the data and then go to the
insert Tab and select pivot table okay
and then it will show up like this and
you need to uh select the table which is
uh
table or range and then you need to
specify where you want to put up this
private table okay and it's quite simple
and I can show it to you in one of the
examples okay so what you need to do is
you need to select this and once you
generate or as we have seen in the
previous slide you need to select this
and you need to uh select the output
where you want to put the priv table and
then once once you do that you will see
something like this and you need to
select these particular fields and put
it in value so it will for example you
need to select the death number of death
you can just simply click this select
this drag and drop it in the values okay
so these are the different fields that
can be put up in the table okay we can
show it to you in the example here so
this is our data and we need to show it
in a p table okay select this and then
go to the insert Tab and click private
table okay select that and it will show
you the uh table or the range and now
where you want to put it okay I will put
it in the existing worksheet okay and
I'll just select which color I'll put it
here for example and it will show you
this and click
okay so this is the table and now you
need to select the fields that you want
to show in the table for example we need
to see the continents the number of
cases as per the continents okay I
selected and put it in the row and we
see the immediately we see it in a table
where you see the number names of the
contents and now I want to see the
number of cases and I simply select it
and put it across in the value so this
is quite simple and very informative
very short and
crisp form of presenting the data in a
pivate table okay so this is how it is
being used and it is being presented we
just need to go to the insert tab fav
table and it will generate the table and
then you can select the fields all right
so the next question here is uh how do
we create a drop- down list in Excel
this is particularly useful when you
need to sort particular data with the
drop- down list where a number of uh
different variables are there and you
need to select one particular uh field
and sort the data so you can do this by
creating a drop-down list using the data
validation option present in the data
tab it's quite simple you select the
data and you go to the data validation
tab in the data and click select data
validation so once you select that it
will ask you to specify a range so you
need to select what data you need to
sort and put a drop down so you need to
select this and click data validation
and you select the list option which
shows you that there is a different
option okay I'll show it across in the
Excel for example what we have here is
uh some particular data and we have
different uh variables we need to sort
or put a drop- down list so just go to
data as in as said in the slides and go
to data validation and click data
validation now as you click it it will
ask you to data validation settings okay
and in the drop down go and select list
option so it will ask you to specify the
source so when you asked uh to specify
the source just click this particular
column and click okay so here I'm
mentioning the source is column B okay B
3 T
B4 Okay click okay and then it will give
you the option so here you can uh you
can put this in anywhere across the
Excel and click the option okay so this
is the way to drop down using the data
validation option so in the next example
we will see so how do we apply Advanced
filters in Excel we use the advanced
filter option present in the data tab so
this is the scenario wherein you have
multiple set of datas and you need to
sort it and it's it's actually huge data
and you need to sort a particular column
or a field with this criteria and you
can select it and specify the criteria
and specify a range what what you want
to uh select or based on what criteria
the range can be specified and you can
just get it in a single click so this is
the option you have to go to data tab
Advanced and you have to apply the
advanced filter and then you need to
specify the list r that is the basically
the source and then the criteria wherein
you specify the criteria present here I
mean you are specifying in this case we
will take an example wherein we are
trying to sort the data or the number of
cases based on number of deaths and in a
particular country and we are specifying
the output we the copy to field is the
output where you will see the output so
I'll show it to you in the Excel so here
we have a spreadsheet wherein you will
see all the uh data covid data that we
have and based on the countries and the
continent and the number of deaths
number of cases and so on okay and it
also has different fields like the date
year and month alone so so here I am
going to sort the data which is
particularly for Europe and which has
deaths of more than 200 in a day so how
do we do it go to data advance and
the you need to select copy to another
location okay and this is the list range
so it's basically given in this country
okay and the criteria range you have to
specify this so I am going to select
this as my criteria okay and then I have
to put the output in one particular cell
so I need to select it again let's say
here okay and then I just click
okay see it's quite simple instead of
running through the whole thing we can
just do it with a simple function okay
okay so it shows me the deaths which are
more than 200 and for which particular
country and for which particular uh
continents all right so this is
basically made very simple with this
option the next question is uh you know
you need to highlight some particular
cells using a particular uh criteria in
this case we are trying to analyze or
highlight those cells where the two
total sales is more than
$5,000 so what we do is we use
conditional formatting to highlight the
sales based on the criteria it's a very
useful tool in analyzing data and
Visually it helps you know you can have
a look at the data in quick flash you
will see the data and it's quite visible
using the conditional formatting so how
we do that is I will show it to you now
so so as said in the slide we have the
data of the sales that is provided to us
and we need to see who has done more
sales which is greater than the $5,000
so just go to home and you need to say
go to conditional formatting so for that
you need to highlight or select this go
home conditional formatting highlight
okay and you have different options here
you select greater than and you specify
find the value here my criteria is
$5,000 okay we can select which color so
let's go for green
okay see this you will immediately see
the option you don't have to dig or
looking deep into the data and find out
which one is more than 5,000 or any
particular value okay so conditional
formatting now moving on to the next
question the index and match function
you must be familiar with the index and
match function and why it is used
basically index uh function is a very
powerful tool wherein you know you for
example you have a table of planets in
our solar system and you want to get the
name of the fourth planet Mars so you
can do it with a formula using the index
function and at the same time you can
use the match function okay with the
match function together you can play
wonders with it okay match function is
another function that is designed to
find the position of an item in arrange
for example we can use the match
function to get the position of a word
or uh look or in this case we have a
name and we can use the index and match
function to find the city how we do that
is shown here okay it uh it looks quite
complicated here when you see the
formula but uh I can show it to you in
the Excel and explain it further okay so
here I have and I want to know where
these people are and where they belong
to okay so let's see how it goes as we
have seen it and we use the index
function
okay index okay now when I have to
specify the range okay so the range is
A2 and it shows it selects the name and
I want to select it from A2 to A7 okay
E7 sorry e sorry call on
E7 okay so as you see it highlights the
whole table okay now what I'm going to
do is I want to match it okay match it
with a condition I am I am specifying a
condition a 10 what why because I have
to specify a name here and it will show
me the city where he belongs to okay
where it shows is a 2 okay if you see A2
it shows the name through A7 I have to
specify the range here okay not just one
name we are specifying the whole range
as you see if you put the values it will
show you the selection okay here and
what it should be it should be the exact
match so zero denotes the exact match
parenthesis closed and I am putting
another match condition okay what is
this then this will give me the output
what output
is
okay B9 okay this is my city B9 is the
city where I'm trying to find from okay
and what it should look for is a follow
a A1 through E1 okay it you select these
this particular row and what it should
be it should be the exact match again
okay let's see how it goes it will give
you an error because you haven't put the
value here okay so let's
see Andrew okay hit enter and you will
see the city where he belongs to okay
now let's see where Anna
belongs enter and show Dallas okay so
this is the one other function index and
match function being used and it can be
asked in frequently in the interview
questions okay the next question will be
uh how to find duplicate values in a
column okay there are two ways that you
can actually do this and one is uh
basically the very simple one which is
the conditional formatting and the other
one is we have seen this before count if
function okay how we do that you need to
Simply select the data and go to
conditional formatting and select
duplicate values and it's quite simple
and there is another way which give you
the color coded conditional formatting
okay and there is another way that is
the count if function how we do that is
again the you have to put another column
and put up a cter
criteria cont function wherein you see
that you are specifying the
range and the the value which is being
twice or enter duplicate and you have to
put up a condition I'll show it to you
in the X so here we have the data and I
need to find the duplicate values here
so I just select this and as I said it's
quite simple go to conditional
formatting form and then go to
conditional formatting and select
highlight cell rules and simply go down
and select the duplicate values okay it
will give you which color you want you
can simply select red or anything as you
see the moment you select you will see
the duplicate values highlighted okay so
I just cancel this and there is another
way then count a function so I'll put
another column where it says duplicate
names and I will put up a counter
function
here okay so let's see how a counter
function works here to check the or find
the duplicate names so as I said I will
put up a formula function here for the
count F and we'll drag it to other CES
okay count it and uh uh since it's an
absolute reference I have to put up a
dollar
symbol okay my reference here will be H
the here
h
2 okay and again dollar because I'm
using it as an absolute
reference
colum
through dollar symbol
again nine okay so it drags still at the
whole it drags till the all the names
okay the H9 all right and then
what I'll do is I'll put a comma in why
I want to do is I have to select
H2 okay this is my criteria I mean it is
repeating twice all right and I have to
close the parenthesis and if it is more
than one okay so this is my formula I
just put enter and it should say true so
this is the condition and it is true
okay I simply drag it the whole thing
and whether events is uh repeated yes
it's true Andrew it's a duplicate entry
false em is a duplicate entry and it
says true and as you see em and events
are duplicate entries so this is how we
use the count function and the
conditional formatting to sort duplicate
entries in the
date now let's move on on to the last
question for the beginner level and
since we have duplicate entry there is
also a problem to remove duplicate
entries so how can you remove duplicate
values in a range of cells okay to
Simply do that you can delete the
duplicate values in a column by simply
selecting the highlighted cells and
press the delete button so you go in
each column and you see the duplicate
values select it and delete it okay and
and this is one tedious way of doing it
and you can also after deleting the
values you can go to the conditional
formatting choose clear rules to remove
the rules from the sheet so this is one
way okay the next thing is again a
simple button that is there in the data
tab that is the is one of the tools
present in the data tab which is simply
called as remove duplicates it's quite
simple and it's there in the data tools
let me show you in the Excel so here we
are and uh we have this data and we need
to check and remove the duplicate so as
I said go to the data Tab and simply
click on remove duplicates and when you
click on it it will ask you you want to
continue or expand this selection I just
say continue with the current selection
and remove duplicates okay select all
click okay two duplicate entries that
were removed previously we saw that
events and uh Anna we there Emy were
there so that has been removed okay so
that's it for the beginner level and
we'll go to the intermediate level in
the next slides choose from over 300 in
demand scales and get access to 1,000
plus hours of video content for free
visit skillup by simply learn click on
the link in the description to no more
so here we are at the intermediate level
questions and these are like uh higher
level or intermediate level compared to
the previous things that we have
discussed with the basic level questions
uh for the Excel interview so let's move
on to the next thing and so there are
there are some scenarios where you enter
the date or uh some dates in particular
data sheet and you need to find out what
is the day of the week okay so you might
be asking a question how do you find out
the day of a week for a particular date
so that is the function we we have a
specific function and that is the
weekday function to find out the day of
the week for a particular date okay so
as we know these are the seven days of
the week and we just put the function as
it says equals to we day and we need to
enter the column or the area or the cell
address here so weekday is the function
and it will give you the which which day
it is of the week okay week as it says 1
it denotes Sunday okay and three is
again Tuesday okay so this is the
function that is used to find the day of
the
week so now we move on to the next
one and there is a there might be a
question what are the wild cards
available in Excel so basically Excel
supports three types of wild card which
are asteris the star it represents any
number of characters it can be used in
different formulas and all like
multiplication and all so it represents
any number of characters okay the next
one next Wild Card is the question mark
it represents one single character okay
you just need to memorize this in the
back of your mind that it represents
one single characters okay whereas
asteris is it represents any number of
characters and the third one which is
rarely used in Excel it is the Tilda it
is used to identify a wild card
character that is Tilda asri question
marks in the text okay and it is very
rarely used so you need to memorize
these three things that the there are
three types of wild cards we can see the
functions of these in the later sessions
okay now the X one is
we have a question here what is the data
validation illustrate with an example
you might be asked this question and you
have to know what is data validation
what is what is it used for and you you
should know how to set up in an example
okay data validation is a feature in
Excel that is used to control what a
user can enter into a cell okay so you
have with the data validation you're not
allowing a data kind of data that should
be input in the cell okay for example
you have the authority uh by setting up
the data validation that you can enter
either a number or a text or a just
number and so on okay using the data
validation and where is it available it
is in the data tab okay select data
validation option present under data
tools okay and you just need to select
the particular cells where you want to
set up the data validation I'll show you
to you in an example so this is how it
looks like you just need to go to data
tools and click on data validation and
it will show you and you have the
options here allow and if you click on
the drop down you will see different
options like I will show it to you in
the example here okay for this
particular thing if I want you know a
this column should have only names and
it should have if you insert a number
you will be thrown with an error okay
you will get an error message saying
that this is not a valid option okay so
there are some columns where you have to
put only names or you have to put only
numers so you can set this up with the
data validation technique okay you just
allow it or customize it as per your
requirement so this is how it looks like
when you set up an so here we have set
up a data validation saying that it
should not allow you to put any text
okay so you will get an error when you
put a number here the value does not
match data validation restrictions
defined for this cell okay so here as an
example I have some data where I am
putting the names here and I'll put the
salary here I want to make sure that you
know we cannot enter any numbers here
okay it should be only text it should
have only name so how do I perform that
how do I restrict any user
to that they should not be able to enter
any number and it should only enter the
text okay so there is a function okay
you just need to go to data validation
click data validation and here in the
settings I'll go to custom there are
different options here you you can
choose whole numbers decimal list date
time so you these are the option and I
go to custom and I'm giving a particular
formula here okay what is that it should
be only text okay so it's a simple thing
it should be text and I need to define
the range okay so how I'll Define the
range I just select this okay and I
select the range
okay so I have selected the range here
and if you go to input message and error
alert you can customize it is it and
here we are taking the default one and
this is the input message if you want to
set or customize something okay so let's
see how it works okay I have set this
and then I try to put a number here and
it throws me an error the value entered
is not valid because we have set a
restriction a user has restricted values
that can be entered into the cell so
this is how the data validation work
okay the next thing is uh you will be
given a situation wherein you have to uh
you will be given data and you have to
fun perform a function like in this
example we are taking a condition where
in you will have data and you have to
specify the result based on the data you
have to formulate okay so given below is
a student table write a function to add
pass or fail to the results column based
on the following criteria you will be
given a criteria so this is the student
table you're giving the student names
marks and attendance and then based on
that you will have to specify a next uh
a a formula wherein you will see the
result okay based on the pass uh student
data you have to put a past fail results
in the column based on the following
criteria what is the criteria and for
example here in this example what
they're saying is you have to say say
this the student is passed if his marks
is more than 60 and the attendance is
more than 75% okay so how we perform
this function as it says you have to use
the IF function and check with the and
condition to fill the results column
okay so let's see this in the example
here so here is the example and we will
perform the IF function and check with
the and function so how we do that is
here okay so I have
to put the IF function
here okay and check with the and
function okay and I have to specify the
conditions I have to specify where it
should see the or check the conditions
okay so we are checking the conditions
here and the marks should be in row I
mean the column U and it starts with u5
so let's see U 5 okay it will
immediately go to column U and five row
five okay and then what is the condition
we are satisfying here it should be
greater than 60 okay and the other
condition
is uh the column V that is the
attendance column okay and what is the
condition we are specifying V 5 should
be greater than
75
okay and we just close this conditions
with the parenthesis and now we have to
specify the result whether it is pass or
fail
pass comma in quotes
again F okay so let's see how this works
okay
okay see this works okay the marks is 50
and attendance is greater than 80 so he
is fail because he has marks are 50 his
attendance must be more than 75 but yes
he is he has not scored marks more than
60 so we drag the same formula to the
whole thing and you will see the result
okay this is quite simple and you will
see
this formula and using the if and and
check and check with and condition okay
now moving on to the next uh question
you might be asked to you know this is
simple function wherein you can you will
be asked to calculate your age in years
from the current date okay so how we do
that there is a particular function and
it's very simple use the year Frack or
dated IF function to return the number
of whole days between start date and the
end date so you specify a start
which will be uh today's date and the I
mean the birth day and then the end day
will be today's day for example okay and
you will get to know the age using the
ear Frack function and dated IF function
okay so here is a small example and this
is how we use the ear Frack function
okay you specify this uh function and
then specify the input dates that is the
today's dates and the date of birth and
the uh today's date okay and this is one
of the ways to get it and there is also
dated F okay this again it is dat today
function and you specify the input cells
okay so let me show you an example for
the same so here we are and we have
today's date that is 4th of May and date
of birth for anything could me so I will
specify the ear fragment okay equals
ear rack okay and then I should as soon
as you enter you specify the start date
and the end date okay and I will specify
the start date as today's date it picks
the column and then I put the comma and
then the end dat should be this thing
okay and just close it and it will give
you
the
age okay so this is the age for example
if you want to find out my age I don't
want to reveal my birthday but it's
okay
okay let's see if it
calculates I'm 32 years old okay all
right so this is one of the ways and
similarly you can use the dated F
function shown in the example all right
now moving on to the next uh question
you have nested if statements this is
very important and you will definitely
be uh coming across this question how
are nested if statements used in Excel
what are nested if statements the IF
function can be nested I mean it can be
Loop when we have multiple conditions to
meet okay it can be nested the false
value is replaced by another IF function
okay you have specified some condition
and you are uh putting up a condition
and if that condition is not there or
not met then if it will be replaced with
another IF function so uh the syntax
will be like this below is an example so
we actually we use two if statements in
conjunction okay so here is an example
here we are specifying a condition where
in you know uh the result is excellent
if it is more than 80 and if it is less
than 16 it is bad or average so this is
very simple you want perform one if
condition and if that is not met it will
go for the next if condition so we are
nesting to if conditions we are joining
to if statements okay uh I'll show the
same example here in the Excel so here
we are we have some data and the
students and their marks okay and we
specifying a condition wherein uh if the
result or marks are more than 80 the
result is excellent and if it is less
than 60 it is bad or average okay so how
we get this is we use two if conditions
if statements so uh as we've seen it
if if now the first condition is uh our
source or the source is B2 okay so
B2 and what I'm specifying is it should
be greater than 80 all right I just
close this and the result should be
excellent
okay excellent if it is more than 80 and
if this condition is not met it will go
to the next if statement okay we are
nesting another if statement what is the
condition here for the next statement it
will check B2 is less than or equal to
60 you can specify any marks all right
so if it is less than 60 it should give
the result as
bad or average okay specify anything and
you
okay and just close the double
parenthesis so let's see how it works
okay see it works like
this now let's pull up the same formula
the for the other results okay see if it
is more than 90 it is 90 it is excellent
so it is checking the first thing if it
is greater than 80 it is excellent okay
now in this case for Mark it is bad why
because it will first see whether it's
excellent or not if it is not excellent
then it will check the other condition
if it is less than 160 it will give you
the a bad result all right and similarly
so on for the other marks all right so
this is how we use the nested if
statements you are adding two if
statement the first condition and the
second condition with another if
statement okay
okay when it comes to excel it is
basically involves a lot of data and a
lot of data to be analyzed and we have
some powerful tools which are used in
Excel to analyze the data one such uh
important tool is descriptive
statistics that is used to analyze the
data so we might come across a question
and you will be given a data or a table
and you need to find the descript the
statistics of the columns using data
analysis tool okay so you will be given
us maybe for example anything and you
will have a lot of data you have to use
the descriptive statistics option in
Excel for the data analysis okay how you
do that is you have to add a pack okay
you should be knowing that you need to
add a pack which is called the analysis
tool pack which you go to uh file
options and then just click on the addin
and select the analysis tool pack click
uh Excel addin and just click go then it
will add the option and then when you
select the data you have to go to the
click on the data analysis option which
will be which will show up when you
select the addin or when you add the
addin okay then you need to select the
descriptive statistics what we need to
do is we need to analyze this data and
it will show you the Val values like
mean and the you can also customize you
can you see you have this data and for
you to check each and every row and find
the mean the smallest the maximum number
and things like that so this can be
easily done using the descriptive
statistics for the data analysis uh I'll
show the same thing in the Excel how it
can be performed so here we are and I'll
show you you first how to add
the option to it okay go to add and
select analysis tool pack as shown in
the slide and you need to click go if
you just click okay it will not add so
just click go and then you need to
select analysis tool pack okay it will
give these are the different options uh
for now we are selecting analysis tool
pack and then click okay as soon as you
do that you will see the data analysis
this option gets any enable when you add
that pack so this is the data that you
have you need to find or analyze using
the descriptive
statistics so as you see it click data
analysis and click uh select descriptive
statistics okay and it will show up the
option like this and you need to select
the input range okay for some reason
it's already there and if you want me to
show I will show it to you across you
have to select the hold
data okay this is my input range and you
need to select this labels in the first
row so that you know it doesn't take the
first row okay I'll
show okay and now I'm putting the output
in another worksheet okay you can
specify or you can a new worksheet and
these are the options that you can
select you can you are getting a some
statistics which is the default and you
can select the confidence level that is
the mean value and you can set it up by
whatever value percentage you want and
you are selecting the largest one and
the smallest number so all these data
will get analyzed and it will open up in
a new sheet and just click okay and you
will see this so these are the if you
see this is our data paid organic social
and revenue so this is uh uh okay
make it more
precise okay so with a single click all
our data is analyzed okay this is the
mean value and this is the minimum is
zero maximum is this is the total and
the number of count is thousand so you
don't need to scroll down and check what
is the largest amount that is paid so
this is the largest amount for the paid
okay and so on so for the largest
revenue generated all these things are
generated with a descriptive analyst
okay descriptive statistics with a data
analysis tool so the next question is
about a pivot table and this is more
refined or more advanced compared to the
last one that we discussed in the uh
beginner level so here you are asked to
create a pivot table to find the total
cases in each country belonging to their
respective continents you are giving you
being asked to uh put up a table of P
table with two variables basically each
country and their respective continent
so again we have the same data and we
need to set up a piver table which shows
the continents and the countries with
the respective continents the number of
cases okay so let's see how we get this
in the example so here we are we have
the same data it shows the days months
year cases
countries and their continents okay
continents here and so on okay so I am
I'll go to the insert Tab and select the
pavot table okay again the same thing I
will be asked to enter a input range
okay so I select
this and since since it's huge I'll
just put the number to be
7777 okay let's
assume now this is our input reader and
uh where you want the output to be it's
already selected you can put it anywhere
I'm putting it here okay just click okay
and it will give you the option to
select the fields now what we want is
number of cases okay which will show you
the value and the countries and
territories their respective continents
so okay so this is how it looks like and
we have to check now it is asking us to
find the countries okay so with their
respective continents you see this you
see Africa as a continent and you will
see okay you will see
Africa if you just move this you will
see the number of I mean the cases with
the uh respective continents and if you
want to include these countries
territories with their respective
continents you will see as such if you
just expand this you will see the
countries that are having the cases in
the continent Africa okay so country
wise sorted with the continents okay
this is another Advanced step to get the
data or show the data in the previous
table okay another question that you
might be ask this is a basic and we have
already seen this in the previous
example that I have shown how do you
provide the dynamic range in data source
of a pivot table you have to select a
particular data source in your input
table of for to show up in the piver
table so you have to select the input
range but how do you create or how do
you create or provide a dynamic range in
this data source so just need to create
a name table to provide a dynamic range
so where is the data of your table so as
we have seen in the previous example you
will be able to select the input range
and you just need to put this value any
number so that you know it will pick up
the dynamic range for your input source
for the tape okay so now we move on to
the next one and this is about about the
pivot table again is it possible to
create pivot table using multip sources
of data yes yes you can create a p table
from multiple worksheet sometimes you
will have different data in different
sheet can you create a pivot table for
all the worksheet in a single pivot
table yes you can but there is a
condition there should be a common Row
in both the tables so you cannot have
different types of data there should be
a common row okay so then only it will
act as a primary key for the first table
and the foreign key for the second table
okay so this is something that you have
to remember and you need to create a
relationship between the tables and then
build the pavot table so you have to
analyze what kind of data it is it
should have a common Row in both the
tables on both the sheets and then you
have to establish a relationship between
this table and then build the table okay
there is a visit for that we'll see that
later now let's move on to the next
question so the next question is again
you know with the pivot table uh wherein
you will be asked to further refine or
uh you know refine your search and show
it in the data so here we have with the
covid data example again you will be
asked to create a pivot table to find
the top three countries from each
continent based on the total cases using
the co data again we have done this
before we have created a prev table for
this and we need to further refine it
showing the top three countries with the
number number of cases and I will show
that same thing in the Excel and we
already have created a table and we'll
refine it further to show the top three
countries which are having the highest
number of accounts in the respective
cont so here we are we have the uh table
uh already with us and I just click on
the show field list it will show me the
countries and territories what we are
asked is you know to show the countries
with the top three that is number of
cases so you just need to go here and
you need to select the value filter
there is a filter which you can select
with the value and now I select top 10
and what I need is top three it's very
simple and you just need to know these
things okay and based on the Su of cases
okay this is our field already then just
click okay and it will show you the top
three countries so it's quite simple and
it is very important to know this uh
field and how you play with the value of
the filters for each particular uh field
in the pivot table so it shows you these
things all right and now you can refine
it further with the continents and all
okay so different continents and you can
see this so you go there and there's a
value filter you can set up all right
you have set up a value filter
okay okay now there is another one how
do you create a column in a pivot table
okay like you will be given a situation
where you need to add one more column
and show it in the pivot table with a
particular calculation or with a
particular value and you have you don't
have that actual value in your data but
you have to calculate it and show it
across in the table so there is another
option which is called pivot table
analyze and you need to create a
calculated field from pivot table
analyze option so when you go to your
table and then go to pivot table analyze
you will see the option to add a
calculated field okay just go there and
click select calculated field and you
need to Define so in this example we are
going to Define another column where we
calculate the bonus of the sales and
there is a particular formula the
formula is you put an if and statement
and then you calculate the formula you
specify what is the bonus and what is
the way that you're calculating the
bonus and it will particularly add it
another column to your table so let's
see how we do that in the table actually
so here we are we have this table and I
have inserted a uh pivot table and I am
putting it in output
here okay then you will get the table
okay now you need to select the customer
name and the unit sold unit price sales
okay so we'll add another column to it
how we do that is this go to pivot table
tools and then you go to analyze Okay
click on field items and set okay we
need to select calculated field here
select that and we are defining a new
field here which is the
[Music]
bonus bonus and as I said we will put up
a formula for this and we will Define it
how we calculate the bonus okay with
then if and State which we have seen
before how we uh put up
a and if and statement okay now I'm
going to say it as
a like this sales my sales should be
I'll specify a condition how they will
calculate the bonus if sales is greater
than
4,000 and the unit sold okay I am trying
to put it as the unit sold it also
depends on the units sold
is greater than th000 okay for example
let's say th000 a person who is uh able
to do uh sales of th 4,000 and the unit
sold should be more than 1,000 then the
sales what is this the bonus will
be
sales into that is the amount of sales
he has done into 5% okay let's say 5%
bonus
and
sales is if it is 2%
okay
okay we are adding this field bonus and
click add okay so we have added this and
we have put up a calculation for the
formula and you will see this in the so
this is simple way of adding the column
to your existing data and we are doing
the calculations and showing it up okay
so this is one way go to pivot table
analyze and field items and sets you can
select this option and add it okay you
can customize this as I said with adding
different fields this is pretty handy in
analyzing the data which does not exist
in the table and you add some value to
your fav table
okay the next uh question will be about
slicer you must be familiar with what a
slicer is in a piver table and how do
you use it what are the purpose of using
it and how do you put up a slider in the
pavot table so how does a slicer work
basically slicers are used to further
filter data in the pivot table suppose
you already have some data and it's for
ease that you can do it by just adding a
slicer you can select particular uh data
in or a field and you can see the output
for that particular field that you have
chosen in the slicer okay so it's very
simple go to the insert Tab and select
slicer under filters okay and then it
will be like this okay and here if for
example you see this is our P table we
have added two slicers to filter our
table that is month and countries and
territory so this will be the general
pivot table that looks like and we have
added another two slices that is month
and Country so if you go uh for example
if you want to see what is the number of
cases and some of the deaths for a
particular month and for a particular
country you can just do it by a single
click and it will show that particular
data only in the table let's see and do
this in our Excel okay so there is a
table uh pivot table already created for
this and I want to add a slicer so how
do I go ahead and do this is I go to the
options and insert slicer okay and the
moment you click on it you will see what
are the options that you want to add you
can select different fields and uh
select the slice it for it uh for this
example we are choosing month okay this
is one of our sliders you can just put
it
here adjust to the and
again this will be our slider
okay let's add another slicer here
okay and this will be the countries and
territories Okay click on that and you
will see two simple badges here here
that you can choose from so if I want to
know in the month of Feb how many number
of cases were there for particular let
see the moment I choose the month it
will show that particular number of the
corresponding table for the whole and
now I want to further refine it to a
particular country so for example
Australia okay so there were total
number of 18 cases and zero deaths at
the same time if I go for Algeria it is
like this so
as you see it goes like this okay so
this is one of the very important tool
that you can use to show the data in a
much simplified Manner and
ease okay so the next question is about
the pivot table again what is the
percentage of contribution of each
country and continents to the total
cases again the same example for our
code the covid one and this time we want
to show the output as the percentage AG
of contribution for each country and
continents to the total cases so we have
the same data and we generate a pivot
table and we should show it as the sum
of the cases uh to be percentage okay
and this is how we do it this is our
uh data and I'm going to create a pivot
table for this
okay so it shows the table and here I
have to show what is the fields that we
need to select okay for E we just
selecting the cases and the countries
and territories Okay so
cases to be the values
okay okay so this is how it looks
like now when I see let me show it to
you see it shows the number of cases now
if I just want to refine it further and
see it as number of percentage
percentage as the number of cases okay
so how I do it show field list I go here
and I go to Value field settings okay
then again number format show the value
as
okay
sorry show the value as you need to
select this thing percentage of grand
total and then just click okay and you
will see this to be the percentage so it
shows the data in the form of percentage
okay this is very simple and you just
need to remember as we have seen before
show field and then value field settings
okay this is the thing that you need to
check okay Grand percentage there are
other options also and you can select
from whatever you want to do in this
case we are showing it to be the
percentage St okay okay guys now the
next question is
about very important aspect of
presentation when we come to Pivot
charts how do you create a pivot chart
in pivot tables this is very basic or
very you know important aspect of pivot
tables that you can represent a data in
a in a form of a chart and there are
different types of charts which I'll
show it to you in the uh example okay so
we have data here and we want to show it
in right now it is in a tablet form okay
we have put up a p table for this and
now the same thing can be put up in a
pivot chart okay so what you need to do
is go to the insert Tab and select the
pivot chart it depends on different
versions of excel that you have
different uh forms or different buttons
so I will show it across to you and this
is how it looks like okay it's very
simple it can be a pie chart it can be a
bar chart it can be different forms and
we can see that in the example here okay
so let's go to the example
and so we have the uh pivot table
generated here already what you need to
do is you need to select the table and
go to insert and see the options there
are there is a column chart there is a
line chart there is Pi Bar area
scattered and other parts okay there are
different forms okay so right now what
we do is we will select the column chart
here okay you need to select the pivot
table and click on the column chart
again there are different forms which
can be seen uh in some time now so this
is the basic form okay and it will show
you the countries I mean the it will
show it as has a form of a chart okay
again you can change the chart type you
can change it to Pi okay this personally
is very good in presenting or doing
presentation and you can select
different forms different styles okay
you also show you the percentage so this
is one form of presenting your table
into a chart okay again bar type is also
there so so this won't suit here in our
example there are different ones I'm
just showing it to you as how it looks
like so depending on your um I mean the
aesthetic you can see and select what
kind of chart is best suitable
okay so this is how you put up a pivot
chart in pivot tables okay so this is
then last for the intermediate level and
what are macros in Excel create a macro
to automate a task basically you have
some daily task that you perform in
Excel okay and you can do this with
quite ease using the macros okay it
basically is a program that resides
within the Excel file and it is used to
automate task in Excel some some daily
task that you run like running when you
come across in any data and you have to
scrub that data and you do some daily
routines and by removing some columns or
adding some formulas and you know doing
some adding some colors and changing the
fonts or beat anything that you perform
and you have to do a repetitive task so
all that can be done by recording a
macro and this is what macro is used for
in Excel so how you capture those steps
in Excel is through a macro to record a
macro you can either go to the developer
tab in the Excel and click on record
macro or you can use or access it from
The View tab okay so these are the uh
ways to access macros okay just go to
the developer tab and click record macro
where in you know when you click record
macro it will record the steps that you
performing in each step and it will
capture that and you can save that it is
like a daily routine that you run and
you can do all these multiple steps
maybe n number of steps within a single
click by running that macro later on
okay so you record a macro and run that
okay you do it through the developer tab
go to developer tab and click record
macro and it records all the steps that
you're performing okay you need to name
it and you just need to perform the
actions and it will record the macro and
you just save it later on whenever you
come across the same daily task that you
run you can just click it by running
that macro okay B so in a single click
it will perform all the actions that you
have done or steps that you have
performed on that particular Excel sheet
or any other Excel sheet okay this is
very handy when you have similar data
and you do the similar task each day
okay so this ends the intermediate level
and in the next we slides we will see
the advanced level so now we discuss the
advanced level uh interview questions
for Excel and when it comes to the
advanced level you will come across
definitely you will be asked about what
if analysis how does it work how does it
how does waterf analysis work in Excel
so waterf analysis as the name suggest
uh you have to have an analysis done
okay with the help of different complex
mathematical calculations like formulas
and using different formulas and
calculations you can experiment with the
data and you can analyze if this
particular input changes what will be
the scenario how how will your output
turn out to be so as you can see uh it
is about different variables to see how
your changes would affect the outcome of
a situation so this is what uh what if
analysis is and the same thing can be
done with Excel and how it is done is
you need to go to the data Tab and click
on the wtif analysis under forecast okay
so there are three options in
one is the scenario manager goal seek
and the data table so these are the
three situation or three tools which are
available in the waterf analysis in the
data tab okay so goal seek is basically
for reverse calculations okay and you
have some idea you have some set goal in
mind and you have certain variables and
what you need to do and what you need to
achieve to have certain set goals okay
you have you will set a value for the
goal and with the goal seek option you
can get to know what value you have to
achieve to come to that level okay so
this is what goal seek is it is one of
the simplest sensitivity analysis tool
and uh so for example you know that you
know a single outcome you would like to
achieve a like you have a set goal that
you have to achieve this particular
grade okay and the goal seek feature in
Excel allows you to arrive to that goal
by mathematically adjusting a single
variable within that equation so you set
the goal and you will do the what if
analysis goal
seek uh option to know what you have to
do or what you have to achieve for the
set goal
the next option is the data table and it
is basically uh used for sensitivity
analysis okay so in this uh
scenario you the data tables allow the
adjustment of only one or two variables
within a data set but uh each variable
can have unlimited number of possible
values okay so basically they are used
for side by side comparisons and it
makes it very easy to read the scenarios
okay one but you need to set up the data
table correctly okay and what you do is
uh you give the input in the table and
then you set up the formula and for
instance you need to calculate the
monthly payments for a loan okay you
provide the principal amount like uh
whatever amount you're taking two lakhs
three lakhs and you set the interest
rate in a formula okay and uh you set
the term in and then you need to uh
provide different uh input options like
what loan amount that you're taking and
you set the formula and go to data table
and I mean go to what if analysis and
select the data table stretches across
and then you will see the monthly
payment options or the monthly Emi that
you can calculate there are different uh
things that you can calculate you can
calculate the target or the sales bonus
or things like that okay giving
different scenarios in the variables
okay but you need to set up a data T it
might be a little challenging but yes it
is a very powerful tool okay so the next
one is the scenario manager it is a bit
more complicated compared to the other
two but then it is uh more advanced than
goal Seeker as it allows you the uh to
adjust the multiple variables at the
same time okay and uh this is very
complicated compared to the other two
and it is even I mean it gives more
better output when it compares to the
other two wtif analysis tools so here
when you go to wtif analysis and the
scenario manager you have to select the
data and provide different scenarios
that is different values for each
scenario and then it will create a it
will analyze calculate and create
different scenarios okay so it becomes
very easy for you to analyze what if you
are changing the value of your interest
amount or the uh term of loan or your
targets like uh monthly targets or an
yearly targets and things like that and
you just have to uh see what the
scenario will be when you set this
particular value for
a table or for data whatever targets
that you need to set you can use this
what if analysis in Excel for the
different scenarios and different
calculations okay these are very
powerful tools and you need to know this
now as we move on to the next one you
might be asked what is the difference
between a function and a sub routine in
a VBA okay even though these two are
used quite frequently there is uh pretty
much different from each other okay so a
function always returns a value of the
task it is performing okay so when you
are uh writing a module you will have a
function when you have a function it
will always give you a value okay for
example you are performing an addition
it using the function it will give you a
value for sure whereas sub routine it
does not return a value of the task it
is performing functions are called by a
variable okay you can uh set up a
variable and you can call the function
okay where sub routines can be recalled
from anywhere in the program in multiple
types okay in many different ways you
can recall a sub routine like we have
seen uh we write a sub routine and we
put up a button and we can when you
click the button it will recall the sub
routine functions are called by variable
okay you have to set up a variable and
when you enter it it will come up okay
functions are used directly in
spreadsheet as for formulas whereas Subs
cannot be used directly in spreadsheets
as formula okay this is very important
difference and the next thing is the
functions can be used to perform
repetitive task and return a value
whereas users must insert a value in the
desired cell before getting the result
of the sub so this is particularly
limited okay whereas functions can be
used to perform different repetitive
task and return return a value user
input is not required whereas if you see
the sub routines user must insert a
value okay in the desired cell that to
in a particular cell which is defined in
the sub routine to getting the desired
result okay so these are the differences
between functions and sub routines now
the next one is what is the difference
between this workbook and active
workbook in VBA so when you work on
modules and different Excel spreadsheets
and workbooks you will have these
different workbooks open and there is a
particular difference and you might be
asked what is the difference between
this workbook and active workbook so as
the name suggest this workbook refers to
the name of the workbook where the code
is actually running from okay you are
running a code VBA code and it is the
actual workbook where you are running
the code from and that is this workbook
okay and you have multiple spreadsheets
open and you're working on particular
suppose for example you're working on uh
sheet X okay and you active workbook is
the workbook that is currently active
from the different open workbooks you
have different open workbooks but you
are working on one particular workbook
and that is called the active workbook
so this workbook is the refers to the
name of the workbook where the code is
actually written whereas active workbook
is the one that is currently open
currently active Okay so this is the
difference between this workbook and the
active workbook in VBA as shown in the
example this is a simple uh sub that is
written a code that can be written to
find out which workbook is the uh uh
which workbook is the uh this workbook
in the VBA and the active workbook as
well okay so this is a simple thing that
you can run to determine okay it shows
the active workbook and the this
workbook okay so as we move on to the
next one so this is the question how
will you pass arguments to a BBF
function okay there are two ways
basically arguments can be passed pass
to a VBA function as a value or as a
reference so this is uh an example that
you can see it is by reference the key
word for this is by reference okay so
when you are passing an argument by
reference the keyword should be by RF
whereas uh by value you're specifying a
value and the keyword is by V value okay
so these are the two ways that you can
pass an argument in
VBA so when you pass an argument by
reference in a procedure the variable
itself okay the variable itself is
accessed by a procedure and it is to the
location or the address in the memory
okay the value of the variable is
changed permanently by the procedure in
this case all right okay so to pass an
argument by reference you should use by
ref that is the keyword before the
argument okay so in this example it is
clearly shown what is the keyword that
is being used okay and by reference is
the default in the VBA unless you
specify something else which in this
case is by value okay and as I said the
keyword for by value passing the
argument by value is by V okay so when
you set the keyword by Val the variable
uh what happens is the by value argument
function or argument uh uh is passed
through by value okay the number
function is called here which means it
assigns a value to the variable X here
okay because the variable was passed by
value in the function any change to the
value okay any change to the value of
the variable is only the current
function so it ends after it performs
the function okay then it convert backs
to the value when it is declared again
where it is set to zero so if the
variable has been passed by reference in
the function then the variable would
have permanently assumed the new
assigned value so this is the basic
Difference by reference and by value so
now we move on to the next one so there
might be a question that you will be
asked that how do you find the last row
or a column in a VBA okay so to find the
uh last row sometimes you have long list
of uh data and it has like n number of
rows and N number of column so instead
of scrolling down all together to find
the uh last row you can use this uh VBA
code you can write this code it's a very
simple one and it will give you the last
row you will find the last row with a
single click okay let's see it in the
VBA so here I have a sheet which uh you
know it has long list of uh rows and
instead of scrolling down I can just
find out the last row with this VBA code
okay I just click on this and as seen in
the slideshow I have just return it and
you will see the you just run it and you
will see the number of rows it will give
you the last row in the sheet okay
similarly we can do this for the column
as well okay in case if you have have
long list of or large number of columns
instead of scrolling right you can just
uh run this VBA and you can see you can
know the last number of column okay
number of columns so as we've seen in
the last row now we'll see the code for
the finding the last column it's the
same thing uh instead of row you will
see it as column all right and it will
when you run it you will give the it
will give you the last column

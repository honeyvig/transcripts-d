on today's visual studio toolbox vulkan
and fucon are going to show us a great
tool for building line of business web
applications
hi welcome to visual studio toolbox i'm
your host robert green and today we're
going to talk about building web
applications with the serenity platform
and to do that joining me are vulcan
jaylon and fucon evron hi guys how are
you
hi thank
you thanks for coming on the show
give us a
brief introduction to who you are and
where you're at and then we'll talk
about serenity
okay
i'm okay
i'm the original author of seventy
framework
uh i'm working on certainty like 15
years
we are a small software house in
istanbul
that's cool
great
who can
i
i'm also
living in istanbul and
yeah
also working on serenity
yeah i'm sorry jesus like ten months
okay so what is the serenity platform
and what problems were you trying to
solve when you created it
senator platform is a
framework for data centric business
applications
in the past we were working with some
cms
with many
listing
screens forms search and reports and so
on and we noticed that we were spending
more than maybe 90 percent of our time
on maintaining creating and maintaining
such screens so
this gave us the idea of creating
certain framework to solve these issues
do you when was it originally created
and what version are you on
it started around 2007
okay but uh it became an open source
framework
in 2013
okay and is it it's aimed at asp.net and
asp.net core
in particular
as an asp.net web forms
platform and we switch to asp.net mvc
and now we are using asp.net core
excellent
all right so
i'd love to see it
show it to me okay
uh i'll start with some introduction to
certainty
short interact section then fuca will
do a demonstration
great
okay this is the information that we
already shared
and certainty as we say it is the right
tool for
data centric line of business
applications with many forms pages and
reports
and
some of
some samples for them are crm cms erp
and so on and then straightening
interface of public facing webpage sites
we are not a front-end framework you can
use any front-end framework like react
view angular you like for the front-end
part of your
site it's amp's reputable of mods
it handles common tasks you deal with
while coding business applications and
lets you spare your precious time
focusing on features that are specific
to application that domain so it handles
validation permissions forms and layout
and similar things
and we get feedback from our users that
it reduces development time from months
to weeks even days
right so it handles a lot of the
plumbing and the usual stuff that's in
every single application right yeah yeah
that's right
and it has a code generator and it's the
rapid development starts there this code
generator analyzes your tables to
extract information like data tables
nullability for in case and so on and it
changes some files like the entity
greatly drive update late list handlers
request handlers
and other classes like yellow and grid
and these generated files are not
boilerplate code and it contains minimum
amount of code
based on some serenity classes
uncertainty uses declarative prediction
entity class everything starts with the
entity class which is which will be
generated by the sargon
then we
use attributes annotations beyond
central reflection
so it allows us to use these information
and cascaded from the entity to grid
columns form services and so on
but we still provide the necessary hooks
where required so we don't hit the
so-called
declarative
like if there's some function that we
didn't think about we still give you
some methods that you can overwrite and
that your
at the functionality units
and also 70
allows you to catch errors early
because it
trans translates some cl some types like
entities enumerations editor types
and so on on the wheels from typescript
to c-sharp and c-sharp to typescript
so you get intellisense support and
compile-time checking
on development and build time not to run
time this was one of the issues that we
were having on in the past
with especially with the javascript code
because of no compile time checking type
checking
and certainty as i mentioned before went
through many changes because
technologies
for software development moves fast
and we never said our users to frame
rewrite their applications we gave them
a clear upgrade pathway possible or
record comparability as much as possible
seren is our starter application
template which we are talking about
today it has about
600k installs and more than 105 star
reviews
impressive
yeah that's all and i'll now leave the
floor to fulcam for a demonstration
great
yep
i hope
now
i'm sharing my screen i'll be creating a
carver solar app using serene template
for this project
i already downloaded an installatory
extension
if you alter that you can just
serene on the projects window
i will name my project siri course
now
serene extension wizard is going to ask
me if i want these features
i can just deselect them but i will just
leave them selected
as they give
more
more samples to look at more examples
now
serenity
is creating my project and it's
installing
nuget packages npm packages
and it is also building the project
let's wait a bit until it builds
while it builds let's also translate
the code
as
vulcan said
it is translating deferred code to
typescript and typescript to
be sure let's run our application and
take your first look
when we run our application
it's going to create a local database
with
project name
and our default db that is inside
migrations
we also use fluentmigrator for
migrations but we will take a look at it
when you first create your application
of course you can see a logo screen i
mean that's expected and you can log in
with credentials admin and serenity
after you log in you're gonna see a
dashboard on the right you can customize
it very easily and on the left part
we see a navigation
and here we have the features that we
selected
on feature selection part we also have
administration part where you can manage
your languages translations
roles and users
now when we create
the random application we
usually start with migration migrations
or tables
and i already did write it earlier
as not to lose some time
but let me just copy migration code and
let it value us
it just creates
a schema
named car then creates two tables in it
and
makes table has a make id and its
identity it has a name and logo
and cars table has a car id for staten b
again it's generated and we have make id
which is a foreign to makes table
we have all sorts of different details
over here and two photo fields again
now after
our reputations right it created
the tables
now we can create
[Music]
oh we can open a terminal page on dot
web
part and let this again do
is that the basic sample data where did
that come from
we are going to create these tables
as a sample
this is a migration we are writing with
fluent migrator it will when we run the
application these tables will be created
in our database
okay
and then we will generate code for them
using sargent
okay
that paypal got created in this local
tv
now
automatically creates a database for
your application in local db but you can
of course move it to an another database
[Music]
and we will select people and people
select cars and makes
module name as you can see on the right
we have a modules folder
this is for separating our code
and for the print sample application
example which i'm getting right i'm
gonna put that in under vehicles folder
for class identifier i will use singular
name car
i believe question ss
for maintenance i will also use assembly
one
more one
and i will create
a row
or entry a repository and net service
centers a user interface using pipe
script it also gets created in teacher
code
and custom field so i can also can
create
custom code it is extendable but as we
don't have any right now it's not going
to do anything well let's keep it
something on this
now we got a vehicles folder with car
and make sure
there is
enters
let's
run our application again
and see how it looks after we just
generate our code
wait let's login
and on the navigation board we see a new
vehicle selection
on there you can see a make
but right now this logo is a string
field but we want to upload a file over
there
and we don't want to see
this logo on the grid
and the cars that is the same thing
everything is a string field or an
integer
and we don't want to see these photos
over here too so we're going to change
that really easily
let's go back to code and first let's go
to make
macro this is our main entity by the way
we can just go to property
of logo and write
image upload editor
and the column says
where grids get populated if there's a
property on their own this year it's
going to automatically create a column
for that thing let's run our application
and take a look at this local fields
and
[Music]
the local fields on the grid that we
deleted
and i'll get our application
like as you can see the logo part is
gone
[Music]
it can
create a file and it automatically
handles
temporary file upload
and deleting that temporary file and
moving
that image
to its supposed place with their id and
random file name okay
that is easy and now
let's do some heavy lifting over the car
on the car dialogue actually let's make
this a dialog
so it is it takes the whole package
we can go to
our dialogue and we can
say
[Music]
this is going to be a panel but let's
fix all the fields
first of all i don't want these photos
on my grids so i just deleted them on
the columns
and
on the row
we saw that make id was a normal field
but we want to select from our maze so
we can easily say hey this is a computer
that
[Music]
selects friendly will automatically
generate a
select with id property as its value and
name property as its
display value
and i want to
have a completion on the model so i will
use this thing values that are it's
going to show me what has been entered
to this field before
i want to have
[Music]
true and of course i want to make users
those fields so i don't embrace that
i actually want to have users create
your makes as their go so i will put
that in place that to this service the
competitor too
[Music]
for years
i will
[Music]
and i will make it look like the latest
years or at the top so that is in
descending order max here
turn it here so
you can just write this
and you know here i
i want to see
latest 13 years so i will just be like
yeah for fuel types
and transmission types we're going to
use two emails
other than that right and they're pretty
basic so let me just copy it here
[Music]
actual type is a new number natural
diesel hybrid and trick
and transmission type is just manual
automatic and hybrid
so now we're going to be we're going to
select these three fields
and we're gonna
switch here you know send they're gonna
go to their
field for installations and we're gonna
change these three to
non-build now
you know will be used everywhere on the
dialog on the filters which i'm gonna
show near the end
and
for me photo we already did this
i'm gonna put an image upload editor and
for multiple photos on additional photos
we can use them with the post image
let's create it
let's run our application now
[Music]
after signing we're going to go to the
car page
and yeah we can see to make that be
created let's also
click this and create a new one create
now we can select one of these
bmw one
for model we are gonna
[Music]
be 100 mpi for here we've got the number
fuel type natural transmission hybrid
and usually you cannot start with
negative values if you wanna you can add
an integer editor with elder negatives
true
and we're gonna add a main photo for
this car let's select this one this one
since
so the other one add additional ones
let's just say this
and now we can select all the data is
here
but i also want to steam this like bmw
220i side by side no that's separated
so right now we can do we can go back to
the row and we can declare a name
property
we're going to use
uh sql expression
to look at their values i'm gonna name
this explaining
here
[Music]
[Music]
get joined to this
row by using jma and we're gonna
start with our
name
and we're gonna conquer space
[Music]
is
now
if you want to see this
we can
go ahead to make column uh sorry
columns
and create a new column named explaining
this
invisible
upper build system refresh
let's just start that
when you open
the car page where you're going to see
our explain
now
now let's add some quick builders and by
quick i mean quick for real
so i'm gonna hate this
i'll hide this make name as it's kind of
useless now we already have this data
for them
but it's still gonna
open for this i'm gonna filter it it's
making me so we can just we can hide it
right next to it
i don't have quick closures in this two
emails too so i can just say
over here
from here too
oh i've already done this
you're gonna see there's three new
filters on top of the grid
that has
all the data all the folders that we
have
let's wait for the application
so so we are having a little bit of
difficulty with your audio
from khan but we're seeing the demo so
that's good
[Music]
let me get closer is it better now i
doubt that
yeah i think so
all right now we can feel free using
these fields left i don't need one more
car and check it out
and for this we're gonna create an auras
but i'm sorry people who really like
cars but i don't think this is the
correct model name please forgive me
let's just do this
like
just make it hybrid
and hype it again
[Music]
let's do main photo
and let's select the other ones
and let's save it
let's press right
right
filters are literally quick
that's impressive
that's a lot of
a lot of plumbing and code that just
gets written for you that's pretty
amazing
yeah
[Music]
yeah and obviously if you have an
existing database you can hook up to
that
right yeah we're just looking at sample
databases that come with uh serenity
right
yeah right of course
on our northwind example we don't
[Music]
use migrations to create and teleplay
database but you don't have to like hook
up any any
migration system at all you can just use
your database and
create your entities then other stuff at
serenity and just create an
administrative interface like that
and so to start using this people just
go get the extension which they can find
on the visual studio marketplace they
can search for it inside visual studio
right and then everything you've just
done they can start doing right
yeah and we also
have a tutorial
in 300d
we also have a tutorial
a movie they called formula and trinity.
it is quite
comprehensive for learning seriality
they could also check that out it is
right here on documentation tutorials
movie database
okay
great you also have a documentation
website uh sorry a demo website right
here which they can log in using as
financier entity again
this is using our star chart team it is
a premium team but more samples like
drag and drop grouping product excel and
for the wizard and more polished team
that dark team support
okay result
source code
over here
they can quite easily check that out too
right
so now back on the
the first page you were on it said demo
and then it said buy so talk briefly
about
that there's a free version and a more
advanced version
so what's the difference between the two
of those
they are basically the same they are
both based on seventy uh starshop just
has some additional features
like exhaust style filtering drag
grouping uh more polished bootstrap
five-page stem
but we still have many users who are
still using the open source version so
you can certainly create applications
with the source version as well okay it
just gives you some extra features and
additional premium support fantastic
this is uh this is really cool this is
very very cool stuff
um
i can see why
it's popular i can see why there's been
a lot of downloads and a lot of great
reviews
so this is certainly something that
people can
download it looked pretty easy to use
that's awesome and it looks like there's
a lot of functionality in there so this
is awesome stuff
thanks so much guys for coming on the
show and showing it to
for us us
we will have links to
the
sample website as well as where people
can
uh get the extension in the show notes
and
thanks again thanks so much for coming
on guys
thank you
and so hope you guys enjoyed that and we
will see you next time on visual studio
toolbox
[Music]
you

everyone knows there is an enormous
amount of data generated every second it
has become crucial to analyze those data
as they can be very useful everyone is
aware of the importance of big data
analytics from
big retail markets to education from the
banking sector to clothing brands it is
everywhere how do you handle them how do
you process them at all the answer to
all these questions is big data
analytics hi this is sahana from simply
learn today we will learn interesting
terms about big data analytics which has
become a buzzword everywhere error
before we start please make sure you
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go through the topics to be
covered in today's video
we start by getting introduced to what
is big data analytics
next we will learn about importance of
big data analytics
types of big data analytics
followed by life cycle of big data
analytics
tools
and advantages of big data analytics and
finally will go through use cases of big
data analytics
first we must understand what do you
mean by big data analytics
big data analytics is the technique to
analyze valuable data sets having any
format like structured unstructured or
semi-structured for example music
industries like spotify the company has
nearly 96 million users that generate
tremendous amount of data every day
using this information the application
generates suggestive songs through smart
recommendation techniques based on likes
shares search history and many more
playlists are created automatically and
many more automated processes can happen
what enables this is the techniques
tools and frameworks that are a result
of big data analytics if you are a
spotify user then you must have come
across the top recommendation sections
which is based on your life past history
and other things utilizing a
recommendation engine that leverages
data filtering tools that collect data
and then filter it using algorithm
this is how spotify works
by collecting and analyzing proper data
and incorporating it into business plans
which will further help them in decision
making this is how big data analytics
helps big
business organizations
72 percent of e-commerce companies rely
on data produced from big data analytics
and this data is increasing day by day
any youtube channel can use data
analytics to analyze user interest and
develop his next project based on that
what is the importance of the topic why
do we need to study big data analytics
is the biggest question it is observed
that every organization adopts this
technique for a better understanding of
data and its use
cloud based analytics can store a large
amount of data with minimal cost for
example tools like zoho analytics
microsoft power bi and many more thus
big data analytics can result as cost
efficient
the way of analyzing it is very swift
which will help to analyze all the
sources this will contribute to quick
decision making in any organization
the result of such analysis will help to
develop new products as due to these
products analysis of the companies will
know about their customer likings and
behavior due to all these efficient
strategies big data analytics is very
crucial
let's move forward and understand what
are the types in big data analytics
types of big data analytics
first let's try and understand
descriptive analysis it includes
processing past and present data set
which will lead to help in trend
analysis
in predictive analysis it makes future
predictions based on past or historical
datasets which will help in decision
making
the diagnostic analysis is an advanced
analysis system in which introspections
are made based on why that has happened
and further decisions are taken based on
the available datasets
prescriptive analytics is the process of
using data to determine an optimal
course of action
the next topic we are covering is
life cycle of data analytics
first is business case evaluation will
help decision makers to understand the
source of business in this case the
learner or the team will learn about the
business domain which presents the
motivation and goals for carrying out
the analysis in this point the problems
get identified and assumptions are made
based on the available datasets
in the identification of data once the
business case is identified now it's
time to find the appropriate datasets to
work with in this stage analysis is done
to see what other companies have done
for its similar datasets
in data filtration once the source of
data is identified now it's time to
gather data from such resources this
kind of data is mostly unstructured then
it is subjected to filtration such as
removal of corrupt data or irrelevant
data
which is of no scope further now the
data is filtered but there might be a
possibility that some of the entries of
such data is incompatible to rectify
this issue a separate phase is created
called as extraction phase in this phase
the data which don't match the
underlining scope of the analysis are
extracted and transformed
in data aggregations data sets are
validated and combined with common field
for instance we can
take data set of a student
one data set can be named as student
academic section and the other can be
named as student personal details then
both can be joined together via common
field we can take it as role number
depending on the nature of big data
problem analysis is carried out data
analysis can be classified as
confirmatory analysis and exploratory
analysis in conformity analysis the
cause of the phenomenon is analyzed
before the assumption is called
hypothesis the data is analyzed to
approve or disapprove the hypothesis
such kind of analysis will provide
definitive answer to some specific
questions and confirms whether an
assumption was true or not in
exploratory analysis the data is
explored to obtain information that why
a phenomenon has occurred this type of
analysis answer why a phenomenon
occurred this kind of analysis doesn't
provide definitive information meanwhile
it can provide discovery of certain
patterns
visualization or data visualization is
said to influence the interpretation of
the results moreover it will allow the
user to discover answer to certain
questions that are yet to be formulated
the analysis is done the results are
visualized now it's time for the
business user to
make decisions
using the result the result can be used
for optimization to define business
processes it can be used as an input for
the system to enhance performance
this is all about life cycle of data
analytics

there are multiple tools available on
the market which can help companies in
big data analytics let us go through
some of these tools
mongodb
hadoop
tablo
cassandra these are the main tools which
are used in big data analytics
let's go for mongodb
mongodb is an open source tool that
support data storage it is a nosql
document oriented database mongodb is
used by facebook and google for data
storage mongodb is best suited for big
data by resulting data and further
manipulation for the desired output some
of the powerful resources are crud
operations aggregation framework text
research and the map reduced features
apache hadoop is the most famous tool it
is an open source software utility to
store and process gigabytes and
terabytes of dataset it uses the
mapreduce programming module to solve
problems of analyzing massive data
mapreduce is a framework that helps
programs do the parallel computation on
data the mark task takes
input data and converts it into a data
set that can be computed in key value
pace the output of the map task is
consumed by reducing task to aggregate
output and provide the desired result
tableau is a software company that
offers collaborative data visualizations
software for organizing working with
business information analytics
organizations use tableau to visualize
data and reveal pattern for analysis in
business intelligence
apache cassandra is highly scalable high
performed distributed database designed
to handle large amount of data across
many commodities like servers providing
high availability with no single point
of failure it is a type of no sql
database
now we have covered the important tools
used by big data analytics let us go and
cover distinct advantage of big data
technology
advantages of big data analytics
innovation of new ideas leading to
product development which means
developing new products provides a means
to target new markets increase market
share sell more and increase revenue
streams meanwhile redesigning existing
products enables cost to be cut margins
to be decreased and ultimately more
profits to be made
risk management insights about customers
likings and behavior and market trends
will help decision maker to take their
position on top of that it will help to
get rid of financial risk it will also
assist to detect potential cyber risk
one benefit from big data and business
analytics can help improve decision
making by identifying patterns
identifying problems and providing data
to back up the solution is beneficial
whether the solution is solving the
problem improving the situation or it
has an insignificant effect
here customer engagement specifically
how your customers view and interact
with your brand is a key factor
big data analytics provides the business
intelligence you need to bring about
positive changes like improving existing
products or increasing revenue per
customer
next improving data quality will improve
operational efficiency and valued
feedback from customer which will help
businesses to handle vast amounts of
data it will also help in enabling data
driven decision
but how do these advantages related to
the real world let us cover some real
life use cases empowered by big data
analytics
use cases of big data and analytics
amazon is a well-known name to all of us
it is among the leading e-commerce
platforms apart from offering online
shopping amazon serves us with different
services like amazon pay amazon web
services and many more for a company
like amazon the amount of data collected
on a regular basis is very big to manage
such vast amount of data companies
leverage big data technology
for any company like netflix one of the
most valuable asset is the customer base
because it is the customer who turns the
company into a brand and if a company
fails to meet the expectations of the
customer that probably leads to its
decline big data is a technology that
helps in the management of large amount
of data
big data is like a heart for american
express decision making
their main goal is to detect fraudulent
transaction as soon as possible for
reducing laws and in this big data plays
a very important role they use big data
for anticipating and analyzing customers
behavior by looking at recorded
transactions and incorporating more than
100 variables the company assigns modern
predictive models instead of customary
businesses
next is
very important that is google
google uses big data to understand what
we want from it based on several
parameters such as search history
locations trends and many
more after that it goes through an
algorithm where complex estimations are
done and afterwards google easily shows
the arranged or positioned index list
as far as significance and authority
intended to coordinate the users
this is all about use cases of big data
analytics

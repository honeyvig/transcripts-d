- [Brad] It's lunch time and this
is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
(cheerful plucky music)
Here in Redmond we're visited by some
of the smartest people on the planet,
pretty much every day.
Every chance I get, I meet
up with them for lunch.
This week I wrap up my conversation
with Sigal Zarmi, the Global CIO
and Vice Chairwomen of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
(light piano music)
Do you believe that as
you move to the cloud
you're actually more secure
than running on-prem?
- I believe we are.
I think that companies that 
provide cloud services
have no choice and they
are investing a lot
a lot of effort and money
to make sure it is secure.
And they're probably investing much more
than I could ever invest.
- Yeah.
- So, to me they're focused on security
and they're focused on making
moving to the cloud easier
and running in the cloud easier
and providing me with
all of the dashboards
and stats that I need
the most efficient way.
I think that's their business.
We have made a decision a few years ago
to move everything to the cloud first-
- Everything?
- Unless there is a regulatory reason
where we need it on-prem.
- Okay.
- And we are on the journey.
We are moving a lot of
things to the cloud.
Our collaboration, new projects,
existing systems, a lot
of work we are doing
to uplift existing applications.
So not just new stuff
but also existing things.
Move it from data centers that
we have into the cloud first.
And we have seen the benefits.
And it's not just low cost.
- Yeah.
- We really have seen the
benefits in flexibility,
agility, the ability to
scale up and down as needed.
You have a much better flexibility
around your support model.
- I'd love to get some thoughts from you
about how the role of the
CIO is evolving more and more
into one who's driving the culture change
about how work gets done
and how people create.
- Used to be that the
CIO just worried about
the systems, the infrastructure.
Then it went on that the
CIOs worry about security
and enterprise applications
and making sure
that things are working efficiently.
Now, it's all about culture,
it's all about culture.
The way employees are
working with technology
is so instrumental to
the way to deliver value
to either the clients or
within the organization-
- Yeah.
- that you have to make sure
you focus on how we work,
not just what tools we use, but how do
we leverage those tools?
- Yeah.
- How those tools are available for us
to be more effective, more agile,
more flexible and deliver
higher value to the customers.
- [Brad] It's about enabling users?
- It's enabling using to be flexible,
to have the tools that
they need to do their job
and let them decide.
- Yeah.
- How do they use myriad of tools
to make sure that they are
the most productive ones.
Let them decide how they can add value
to their clients, to the client's clients.
You know it's not just my customers,
it's my client's customers
that I wanna add value to.
- I saw some research that
you published, PwC did,
on the 80% of senior leaders,
CEOs have really prioritized
increasing their diversity
of their companies.
So, what do you think
organizations stand to lose
if they're not as diverse
as they should be?
- Look, every organization wants
to have the best team, right?
You wanna have the best team to win.
- Everyone does.
- The best team doesn't come
from 50% of the population.
- Well said.
- So you need to look at diversity,
that's specifically to gender diversity.
Now when you think about other diversity
I think it makes a much stronger team
to have diversity of opinions,
of backgrounds, of different experiences
and if you wanna win
you have to be diverse.
- [Brad] It has been a
sincere pleasure, seriously.
- [Sigal] Same here.
- Yeah.
- It was wonderful, thank
for for inviting me.
- [Brad] Thank you very very much.
We'll see you again!
- [Sigal] All right, see you.
(upbeat organ music)
- Next time on Brad
Anderson's Lunch Break:
So the original secret
formula of Coca-Cola
was kept in Sun Trust
vaults from 1925-2011.
What did you think we you
realized the formula was gone?

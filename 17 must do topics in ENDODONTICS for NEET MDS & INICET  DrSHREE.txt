yeah hi winners this is dr srikant from
team mds conquer now i'm just going to
give a brief glance of
how you need to handle subject endo from
entrance point of view
okay so before going into the contents
uh i want to show
utmost gratitude to the entire
staff of vishnu dental college as well
as seniors of dental college for
mourning me what i am today
special gratitude and thanks to dr
giriza sajan my hbod
and dr ram babu my guide has helped me a
lot
to be here in front of you okay so
coming into the details of endo so
before going into indo i can tell you
that
not being an endodontist but what i can
tell you like endo is
one of the easiest subject in the
entrance point of view indoor along with
p
pedo is again the one more easiest
clinical subject so when i'm preparing
also i feel like
indo i used to finish it very very fast
and second important thing endo is
interesting and endo you're you're being
learning ender from long back like
you're in your third year you started
your pulp and periapical
lesions diseases and everything so endo
can be done fast
indoor can be done simple right so first
important thing i want to stress on is
endo
is being integrated with pedo
contents that is you have your pediatric
endodontics
where you are going to cover
epixogenesis apexifications
your pulp regenerations vital palpates
and pulpotamis pulpectomies and all
these are part of endo which are being
integrated to the pedo
so of course endo is being integrated to
the perio also that is endovarial lesion
endo is being integrated to the period
that is endo period lesion
so endo is being integrated to the oral
surgery also
not very specific but your effect sector
means
okay so your periapical surgeries your
micro surgeries are
a part of your oral surgery also it's
being integrated to your microbiology
okay so that is your oral microbiology
so endodontic microbiology is a part of
your oral microbes so it's being
integrated to the so many subjects
and according to the neet blueprint okay
i can allocate
there will be 10 plus score from
indo-exclusive of course
endo plus cons it's going to hit
somewhere around like 14 to 16 plus for
sure definitely but endo exclusively
going to be more than 8 or 10 plus in
your need
and coming to ini ct endo is an upgraded
subject
lots of importance like you'll have 10
to 12 questions
on endodontics exclusively in the in icd
okay a
subject which has lots of demand subject
which has
lots of waiters okay coming to the
individual topics and the contents what
you have to do from endo okay
i can list out them as first is a
diagnosis
so in diagnosis you have to cover pulpal
diseases
periapical diseases pulpal
plus periapical diseases that is your
american association of endodontics
classifications
everything has to be done which are not
there in your textbooks which are
important
so in diagnosis point of view you need
to cover like
the diagnostic aids okay the diagnostic
gates
you need to cover your pulp vitality
test has to be covered pulp sensibility
test has to be covered
the recent pulp vitality like your pulse
oximetry laser diplomatic has to be
covered
top to bottom so everything was covered
in the smart videos no need to worry
the second important content of endo is
your
pulp and pulpal diseases
means your pulp histology has to be done
so if you see recent
neet or inict questions that is given in
2020 21
there are questions on pulpal uh jones
jones of the pulp the questions on fish
jones okay there are many things which
are moving around the histology of the
pulp which are very very important
from examination point of view and the
next one is periapical diseases
periapical diseases has to be done so
these are like pulpal diseases and
periapical diseases
are your part of your oral pattern oral
medicine
right which has to be done top to bottom
then the next fourth one i want to
stress on is anatomy of the pulse
so regularly your dental anatomy is
going to cover the external anatomy now
you will be focusing more on the
internal anatomy
so in this internal anatomy okay you
need to learn about the number of canals
in each teeth
number of roots in each teeth okay what
is the extra channels that you find like
for example if you take
2020 inict question the percentage of
mandibler
central's having two canals 41.4 is a
question directly
from the contents of your internal
anatomy so apart from this internal
anatomy there are
questions which frequently ask like
veen's classification vertices
classification of your root canals
is a frequently asked question even in
your 2021 meat
there is a question on the veins and
vertices classification okay so which
are very very important so
simultaneously you need to cover the
laws of
orifice loss of rfi's openings and
everything which are part of your access
opening also
in the internal anatomy the next one is
your axis opening
so the basics of axis opening the
objectives of axis opening
okay so the different types of axis
opening techniques what are the latest
advanced like swapping techniques like
your ninja technique most conservative
opening techniques
okay so these are the advanced things
that you have to make your own apart
from the regular thing so most favorite
question for access opening the main
purpose of access opening is to provide
a straight and access to the apical
foramen but there are few
things advanced things that you have to
make and what you have to learn
okay so once you're done with access
opening the next one is working length
different types of working length okay
so different methods of
analyzing the working lengths what is
the beans modification what is ingles
modification
what is grossman's method of identifying
the working length what is a great
method of identifying the working length
what is the best method of
knowing the working length that is your
combination of your radiographic and
non-radiographic technique
so they can ask you what is the
radiographic techniques which are the
following is an all radiographic
technique
they can ask you the different
generations of epics locators
okay nowadays examples of generations of
epix locators may not be asked because
because it's completely memory based
but long back five years back we used to
have a questions on
i which are the following is an example
of a third generation of x locator
what are the recent apex locators that
are available so now fx locators are
being
uh in combination with the endo model so
they comes under with generation
so all these questions are the regular
questions that can be asked
so for example if you see 2016 neet or
aapg you have a question like which is
the type of
working determination in the case of
open fx that is by using your paper
points okay
so such questions like where apex
locators are contraindicated so all
these are the questions
of choice so when i'm talking about the
working length
so next comes the working length okay so
it's better you you start your
instrumentation here
so what are the different types of
instruments what is dg16 what is ck17
so instruments which are used what is
index is opening bar what is z
bar okay so what are the instruments
which are used at different levels
during access opening water use
during biomechanical preparation water
use during observation water used
during post and core what are used what
are your gg drills what are your p's or
remembers
so all these are the diagram based
questions or conceptual questions they
can ask you for
so next talking about the
instrumentation you need to learn about
the different types of tapers what are
the advantages of smaller taper
what are the disadvantages or the
advantages of larger taper what type of
taper you have to use
in the modern endodontics okay so cross
sections of your files
what is file what is reamer what is h
file what is k fire what is fixer gate
and all these are the questions which
are frequently asked cross sections of
the files is a diagram based question
that is given in the recent ini c82
so you need to learn top to bottom
simple easy to understand
and easy to glance so bake a note in
instrumentation you need to learn about
the rotary instrumentation because ini
ct
so there are many many questions on the
rotary instrumentation what are
different generations of rotary files
what are the recent files what is saf
okay what is the cross section of a
protaper
okay so there are many many such things
there are regularly constantly hitting
on the question paper so this is about
instrumentation you need to learn about
the recent
instrumentation different types of
irrigation devices you can
you have to use for example if you take
essential papers offender there is a
question of epic sum
xm is something that is known by a pg
student but it is not to the level of an
eu
it is nowhere there in any textbook okay
it's an article-based question so what
is epic sum basically
okay where it is used what is head want
is a fapex sum what is the speed of
apexime so all these are the
series of questions which are given in
essership papers offender
which you have to do there is no you
cannot escape from this because aims
people
uh they regularly have a habit of
picking the cesar ship concepts or
research
questions directly so you need to do top
to bottom of these
particular areas so once you're done
with the instrumentation that is
regular traditional instrumentation as
well as the advanced instrumentation
the next thing i want to stress on is
biomechanical preparation so what are
the different types of biomechanical
preparation you learn so many step back
and all these like
from where you move from apex to coronal
coronal depicts what are the different
types of techniques they can ask you
advantages of techniques they can tell
you this particular canal which type of
biomechanical preparation you can use
so what is the master cone or what is
the initial apical file what is master
apical file
how many times you have to increase okay
which has more advantages which has
disadvantages
all these content has to be done top to
bottom the next one is i want to stress
on obturation
so i hope you know the observation
techniques what is the lateral
condensation vertical compaction
what is thermal related observation
techniques okay
so what is thermo mechanical observation
technique okay the diagrams the
instruments devices
what is observable and what is obturator
up to what temperature they are heated
up
okay so all these are the most commonly
and frequent loss for example i can tell
you like
the mode of observation technique in the
case of your post and code
the answer is chicago technique which is
also called a sexual observation
technique
so what is apical seal so all these
concepts are very very important in the
observation
objectives of obturation are very very
important so next one once you're done
with obturation then i want to stress on
post encode
of course post and code is a part of
both of your prosthetics
as well as your end when you do prostate
core what are the recent post and core
techniques
so what is uh like what what are the
recent techniques what is a metal post
different types and shapes of metal
posts was a question that is frequently
repeated in your
inict you have tapered post you have
serrated tapered post
so you have you have a parallel post you
have a non parallel post so the many
other diagram based questions are
frequently moving around this area
and what are the recent posts that are
available like which which mimics the
coefficient of thermal expansion value
with the dentin
okay so what are these recent posts okay
so there are many many undergrounds
there are many a few recent things that
you have to focus on because
questions are being stressed like there
is one or two questions on the recent
advances itself
which ug students are less familiar of
so i'll try my best to
explain this contents integrate these
contents and
let's learn android the best
so once you're done with this as i
stressed on that is your endodontic
microbiology
is an important area what we have done
is endodontic microbiology we have
prepared a video called as
oral microbiology where we have included
endodontic
plus periodontal microbiology which is
very very important in examination point
of view
has to be done top to bottom because i'm
being seeing a series of questions on
this area
both in 2018 2017 2019 2021 both in in
ict there is a being question thrown
from
oral microbiology oral microbials is a
very very important aspect which you
should not skip
or neglect done so
so these are the main contents that you
have to focus on
then comes your endodontic
micro surgery
okay so your periapical surgeries how
they're associated with the microscope
what is the difference between the
traditional surgery
and peripheral surgery what are the
instruments that are being used
your periapical piezoelectric instrument
based questions like which is used to
cut the bone
that is used both for the implants as
well as the periapical bone removal
is a frequent question that is being
stressed and that's being asked
even in the recent iacd they're being
asking what is the
material with which it is made up of
okay so all these questions are
the questions which are frequently
moving around and frequently being asked
so in this endodontic microbiology you
can add a note about intentional
reimplantation
reimplantation is trauma but intentional
reimplantation is removing and keeping
it a traumatic extraction followed by
reimplantation
is a question that is being asked
recently
then comes after the endodontic
microbiology i want to add a note about
the trauma
trauma you need to learn about elise
classification i hope most of you are
familiar with it
you need to learn about the anderson's
who classification and you need to learn
about the treatment plan for each and
every class
what you need to do for concussion what
you need to do for primary trauma
what happens if you do an enamel
fracture dentinal fracture palpal
fracture
within this time okay emulsion within
this time aversion after this time
so all these are a series of questions
that are being frequently repeated in
your examination
so what are the materials of choice to
carry an abulsic tooth
all these are again a questions which
the paper sitters loves to ask
so we are done with trauma we are done
with this and i want to add a note about
the pulpal
vitality procedures palpable
your direct pulp capping indirect pulp
capping pulpotamis pulpectomies all
these comes under this list
which you are very very familiar with
right so once we are done with this i
want to stress on
endoperiolesians okay so the
relationship of ender and perio
so what is primary endo what is
secondary period so you have a beautiful
classification
so you need to learn which treatment has
to be done first
what has to be done like your hemi
session your bike hospitalization
your route root recession root and
precision so all these comes under
a part of your endocrine relations
so once we are done with endo
periolations okay so the next important
thing i want to stress on is
regenerative endodontics okay which is a
topic being neglected
in many many many many areas okay it's
not there on the
uh or mcqs were not there on the books
but
ames is frequently asking questions on
this particular area
which you should not neglect so i just
want to add a note about the bleaching
different types of bleaching procedures
again what is non-vital bleaching what
is vital bleaching
what are the materials that are most
commonly used and
a technical knowledge of how bleaching
is done and how bleaching procedures are
done
so yes observation i have okay
observation along with observation you
need to do disinfections
so what are the materials that are used
for disinfection because there were
questions on
uh naocl in the recent need so what are
the materials used what is the
percentage of materials use
what is that one days of the ma this
particular material what is the
disadvantage of this material
what are the tests that are associated
with with this what is the sequence of
irrigation solution that is used
so all these are the most commonly asked
or most frequently asked questions
from endoprospect okay so i'm just going
to give a brief glance so these are the
17 or 18
topics that you have to do from endo
okay which are being integrated with
many other subjects
so diagnosis it's well explained in the
smart video
you can finish it fast pulpal diseases
and pulpal histology you're well
familiar
periapical diseases is well familiar so
you can you can
integrately do this first three topics
so anatomy external anatomy can be
integrated to the internal anatomy that
is your dental anatomy
plus internal anatomy of the pulp here
your anatomy is being linked to the
opening axis opening
okay and make sure your instrumentation
working biomechanical preparation
and obturation and disinfection has to
be done simultaneously post and core is
a prosthetic part
it's a different part okay endodontic
microbiology is a very short thing which
which can be done in one hour maximum
60 minutes you can spend a time of 60
minutes trauma is a good thing
more often a conceptual thing no need to
mug up anything except the anderson's
what's classification
and your pulp vital procedures is a
known thing
endopair relation is a known thing
okay regenerate endodontics is not going
to take more than 30 minutes
it's going to take max and 30 minutes
and bleaching is going to take maximum
one to two hours
okay so integratedly you can sit for
like five days spending eight hours
five eighths 40 hours is going to be a
perfect time
to finish pack revise and do
a proper mcqs fermentor so what you need
to do where you need to do
i feel like grossman is more than
sufficient for you until unless you are
done with grossman
and you want to maintain some high fair
book make sure uh my first preference is
to go with ingle english too heavy
even for a pg student it is too heavy so
i don't suggest a uc to read angle
for an entrance point of view for a five
or six days of initiative
okay if you mean few people they may
read ten days but
my my allocation for endo is going to be
like six or seven days maximum
right so grossman you can keep as a
basic reference and coming to the
question solving aspect uh i i strongly
recommend you to go ahead with the
dentist
so raintest is good for endo and of
course we will try to provide as much
content as possible
on the on the website okay so you'll
have your daily
uh topic specific practice as well as a
subject specific practice including your
diagram based questions on the indoor
from my point of view i'll try to
provide a minimum of
500 to 600 questions on endo on the
website
which you have to do integrated with the
smart videos we'll try to provide as
much content as possible with the smart
videos
and of course case-based questions of
indoor are very very important because
inicit
there is many questions which are given
on the case based and of course
as neet is being integrated nowadays
there are chances that they can
extend this case based questions of endo
also for us
clear so this is all about endo endo has
to be done with interest
endo is easy okay trust me
i'll make sure from team mds conquer
that endo is going to be the simplest
subject
among the list for your preparation done
for now
signing off dr shlekan from team mds
conqueror
bye take

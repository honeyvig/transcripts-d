when you think of AI agents do you
picture a personal assistant like Tony
sock Javis or the Cal Under Pressure
task from the interstellar fear not
today's aitech isn't quite science
fiction till now currently AI agents
leverage models like GPD to understand
goals generate tasks and complete the
automating work and handle complex
cognitive task they can seamlessly
integrate into your favorite apps
creating a team of robotic
co-workers with rapid advancement in AI
models and no code platforms now is a
perfect time to experiment and see what
AI can do for you with that said guys I
welcome you all to our today's tutorial
on AI agents in this tutorial we are
going to explore what AI agents are
their functions types how they are
transforming various industries by the
end of this tutorial you're going to
have a comprehensive understanding of
what AI agents are exactly craving a

further updates so let's get started so
guys before you move on let us discuss
our evolution of AI so guys in 2022
there was an era of large language
models these models like gpt3 became
very much popular the could write emails
generate code and answer questions but
were limited to specific task without
broader integration in 20123 there was
introduction of compound agents compound
agents appeared combining multiple AI
models to handle very very complex task
they could perform several actions based
on the data and context provided making
them more useful than single purpose
model and in 2024 we will be seeing a
rise of integrated AI agents in agents
will become a key part of our business
processes they could perform task
independently learn from interactions
and adapt to new requirements providing
a comprehensive approach to automation
like you see Google assistant or Siri
working for you to pick up the call
scheduling a Google meet in your
calendar and
Etc now let us move on and understand an
example first so let us study about a
problem first so guys suppose I have a
question that how many leaves I can take
in this year so what I'll do guys I'll
put up a query okay and shoot it to the
model which is a basically a large
language model and it's going to give me
a solution but do you think the answer
will be correct because this model does
not know me exactly so definitely it's
going to give a wrong answer so guys
this model will not give me a right
answer definitely because the model does
not understand like how many leaves I
have okay how many leaves are I lotted
so there is no data this model has about
me so this is basically a traditional
shf model now let us understand about a
compound AI system how it is going to
integrate with a database study about my
data and then it's going to give it us a
query so guys let us see this
scenario so suppose I give a query like
how many leaves I can take so it is
going to generate a search query first
okay next what will happen this model or
llm is going to search the database okay
it's going to search study about the
entire data and then it is going to
predict like how many leaves I can take
so this is how generally compound AI
systems work okay and the solution which
I'm going to get will be definitely
correct now let us understand quite
frankly what basically is an AI agent so
guys AI agent is a tool that can perform
task on its own by understanding and
reacting to its surrounding you can
think it of as a self-driving car which
navigates without the human help a
agents can use Technologies like
generative AIS large language models and
naal language processing to typically
give you an answer or react according to
the environment they just typically need
one instruction to get started another
example can be a customer support
organizations where you see AI agents
act as an additional type agent within
the existing systems to help customers
these agents utilize Advanced
Technologies and large amount of
propriety data and brand history to
provide personalized experiences
they can be continuously updated and
customized by analyzing the current data
and ensuring they remain effective and
relevant so guys we have seen about
shift model and compound AI systems so
you would have got a brief idea
regarding this now let us move on and
understand about the key functions of AI
agents so guys if you talk about the key
functions the first is that AI agents
continuously monitor their environment
such as data fluctuations or customer
Behavior suppose course we have an
e-commerce AI agent tracking sales
Trends to adjust inventory levels okay
now the second task would be its
responsive actions they act based on
their perceptions to influence their
environment suppose an AI agent is
adjusting the product prices in real
time based on the market trends so you
can see how AI agents are working in
this scenario third thing you can ask
about reasoning and interpretation AI
agents are interpreting complex data
sets to extract meaning ful insights for
example analyzing social media data to
understand customer sentiment next thing
what we can see is problem solving and
inference learning now they can excel in
finding solutions to complex challenges
suppose optimizing a Supply Chain by
predicting and mitigating potential
disruptions then AI agents can draw
inferences from the data to predict
future outcomes suppose predicting
customer preferences to personalize
marketing strategies and finally we are
going to get action and outcom analysis
they determine the best actions to
achieve desired outcomes example
planning marketing campaigns based on
the potential ROI analysis okay so these
were some of the key responsibilities or
key functionalities what AI agents can
do now let us study about types of AI
agents so guys our first one is simplex
reflex agents these agents basically
react to the immediate perceptions
without an internal model for example a
thermostat adjusting temperature based
on the current readings okay so this can
be one example based on this so these
are Simplex reflex agents the next one
can be model based reflex agents so
basically what they do they use an
internal model to handle partially
observable environments example a robot
vacuum mapping a room to navigate
efficiently this can be a very good
example of a model based reflex agents
third one can be goal- based agents
suppose they make decisions based on
achieving specific goals Suppose there
is a navigation system finding the
fastest route to a destination so that
can be a goal- based agents now fourth
one can be utility based agents who
basically deal with maximizing
performance using a utility function
Suppose there is an investment AI
selecting portfolios to maximize the
returns okay now the fifth one can be
the learning agents what they do guys
they improve performance over time
through experience a recommendation
engine refining suggestions based on
user
interactions next one is multi-agent
systems or Mas if I talk about
multi-agents they work together towards
a common or individual goals a network
of AI agents managing a smart City's
infrastructure can be one of the example
of multi-agent systems and finally we
have hierarchial agents basically guys
they are organized in a hierarchy with
specific roles at each level Suppose
there is a management AI oring other
agents in a manufacturing plant
so these were the type of Agents I hope
so you would have got a brief idea
regarding this now let us study about a
case scenario and see how a agent is
going to work so so suppose guys there's
a company which aims to enhance its
website performance and Boost customer
engagement to achieve this this company
utilizes an AI agent integrated with
Google analytics now the first task what
they are going to do guys the first task
would be monitoring the website traffic
so in this scenario the AI agent role
will be that it is going to continuously
monitor the website traffic data using
Google analytics and the key metrics
would be it is going to track crucial
metrics such as page views bounce rates
and user demographics to understand how
visitors interact with the website
suppose if I talk about the page views
the number of times page on the websites
are viewed like providing insights into
which pages are attracting attention
Okay if talk about the bounce rates it's
going to tell about the percentage of
visitors who leave the site after
viewing only one page or indicating any
potential issues with the engagement or
relevance then there will be a role
about user demographics so there will be
information about like visitors such as
age gender and location helping tailor
content and marketing strategies to the
audience so guys basically in this case
study what parameters we are going to
look the first one will be perceiving
the dynamic changes responsive actions
reasoning and inter ration so these
first three tasks would be performed by
then AI agent next task would be its
problem solving then inference learning
and finally action outcome and Analysis
we have discussed the first phase that
is perceiving the dynamic changes where
we discussed about the page views bounce
rate and user
demographics now let us move on to the
next stage that is the responsive
actions here the task will be
identifying underperforming pages so an
AI agent's role would be like
identifying pages that are not
performing well based on the traffic
patterns so it is going to give
suggestions for improvement like it is
going to provide actionable insights
such as content updates layout changes
SEO improvements to enhance the user
engagement now if I talk in details like
in content updates what is going to do
it will be responsible for refreshing
outdated content and adding new
information to keep user engaged and
informed then it could go for layout
changes where it is going to adjust the
design and structure of the pages to
improve user experience making
navigation little bit easier and more
intuitive the third one can be an SEO
improvements where it will be involved
in enhancing the Page search engine
optimization so that you have an
increase in visibility and you can
attract more visitors now the third
would be reasoning and interpretation
now here the AI agent role is going to
be that it is going to analyze the user
Behavior to understand what drives the
conversions like the action that
fulfills the website scod like purchases
or signups then here it's going to
interpret the data where from like
Google analytics to pinpoint High
performing content and strategies so you
can see like how these things are being
done by an AI agent okay in this Cas
while doing the reasoning and
interpretation he will also come to know
there's a problem to solve basically so
here in this scenario it could be like
the AI agent is going to tackle issues
like high bounce rates by optimizing the
landing page to retain the visitors or
can perform AB testing to test the
different versions of pages to determine
the most effective design and content so
you can see the AI agent is doing these
tasks simultaneously suppose reasoning
and interpretation at the first go and
then going for the problem solving now
let us move on to the next phase that is
inference and
learning now here in the scenario the AI
agent is going to learn from user
interactions and continuously refine it
strategies to improve recommendations so
here we be the continuous updates where
it is going to update its suggestions
based on the latest data to stay
effective so you can see in this case we
have the user interaction learning then
we have adaptative recommendation so
these are the things which is generally
given by the AI agent so basically in
the scenario the AI agent is going to
implement the suggested changes and
closely monitor the results to gge their
effectiveness now here what it can do
guys here it can use the user
interaction learning okay and it can
give you the outcome based adjustments
suppose if I talk about the first one
what is going to do it is going to track
the impact of implemented changes on key
metrics like page views bounce rates
conversions using this information to
assess the success of the interventions
and the next part it is going to modify
the strategies based on what works and
what doesn't to keep improving the
website performance and user engagement
so you can see all over here I showed
you an example that how AI agents will
be involved in the business processes to
move more streamline the business and
improve the revenue so this was one of
the examples and by following these
steps AI agents helps the company
optimize its website leading to better
performance and high customer
engagement so guys this was an overall
case study and I hope so you would have
got some brief idea regarding what AI
agents will be capable of now let us
discuss about some of the future trends
of AI agents the first one that comes up
to my mind is AI enable customer
experience so guys there will be
enhanced personalization and interaction
AI will be revolutionizing customer
experiences by using intelligent
chatbots and virtual assistance these AI
systems can understand and response to
customer queries in real time then it's
going to offer personalized
recommendation based on individual
preferences and past behavior for
example there will be an online retailer
using AI powered chat boards to assist
customers with product recommendations
like order tracking and resolving issues
instantly
the next one that we have all over here
is Automation and Robotics so here what
you can expect guys suppose factories
using robotic arms for assembly fire
lines warehouses using AI to manage
inventory and automate the Sorting
process and also self-driving cars
navigating the streets so these were
some of the examples in Automation and
Robotics then we could see an example of
generative a suppose you going to see a
tool like Del generating artwork based
onch Tex descriptions or AI composing
original musics that artists can use as
a foundation for New pieces then you can
get AI assisted decision-making suppose
in a scenario where doctors are using AI
to analyze medical images for quicker
and more accurate diagnosis Financial
analysts leveraging AI to predict market
trends and Engineers using AI for
optimizing design and
processes next phase would be ethical AI
so guys this is also one of the most
interesting domain of AI agent so here
what what is going to happen guys we are
going to get an responsible transparent
and unbiased AI operations in the
scenario as AI will become more
pervasive it is crucial to ensure that
the development and deployment are done
ethically so ethical AI will focus on
creating systems that are transparent
accountable and free from bias this
involves by setting guidelines standards
for AI development to protect users
privacy rights and ensure fair treatment
for example impl M rigorous testing and
validation process to detect and
mitigate biases in AI models and
ensuring transparency in how AI
decisions are made so in this scenario
the ethical AI agents are also going to
intervene in the market so guys that was

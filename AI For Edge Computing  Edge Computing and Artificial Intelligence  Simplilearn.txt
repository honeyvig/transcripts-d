any further Ado let's jump directly into
our today's topic so firstly let us
understand what is Edge Computing the
term Edge Computing for AI refers to the
process of running air computations and
processing close to the data source or
Edge devices at the edge of a network as
opposed to relying on centralized
cloud-based servers in order to enable
real-time data analysis pick a response
times and a decreased Reliance on cloud
infrastructure it deploys AI models and
algorithms directly on edge devices or
local servers
here it's Computing typically entails
the deployment of lightweight AI models
designed to use on edge devices with
constrained computational power then
these models are frequently deployed to
the edge after being trained using
cloud-based resources The Edge devices
gather data from their sensors or from
outside sources process the data locally
using the a models that have been
deployed and give prompt responses or
start processes based on the data but
water to the rise of Hai well with rapid
advancement in technology in every
sector and businesses are looking to
increase automation to increase workflow
productivity and security and for that
computer programs must be able to
identify patterns and Carry Out tasks
repeatedly and safely in order to assist
people now the range of tasks that human
perform however covers different
situations that are impossible to fully
describe in quotes and rules because the
world is very unstructured well with the
help of developments in Hai machines and
gadgets can Now function with the
intelligence of human cognition whenever
they may be smart applications with AI
capabilities can learn to carry out the
same tasks under various conditions just
like in real life and here are the three
recent innovations that explain why
using AI models at the edge is on the
rise well first on the list we have
advancement of neural networks now over
the years as you know neural networks
and related AI infrastructure have
advanced unmatured allowing for more
generalized machine learning
capabilities this means organizations
have to gain a deeper understanding on
how to train a models effectively and
deploy them in production at the edge
development in computational
infrastructure now running AI at the
edge requires substantial computational
power the field has witnessed notable
advancements in computational
infrastructure to support AI at the edge
particularly recent strikes in highly
parallel graphic processing units or
gpus and CPUs have enabled efficient
execution of neural networks gpus are
specifically designed to handle complex
parallel computation making them a
suitable choice of processing Ai
workloads and finally widespread usage
of iot devices now the widespread
adoption of Internet of thing devices
has generated vast amounts of data these
devices such as industrial sensors smart
cameras and Robotics provide a rich
source of data that can be utilized for
AI analysis at the edge the availability
of diverse iot devices and their ability
to capture real-time data has
facilitated the deployment of AI models
at the edge but why deploy AI at the
edge what are the benefits of edge
Computing now Edge Computing for AI
addresses the limitations and challenges
associated with conventional cloud
generic AI methods so here are some of
the advantages which it offers firstly
decreased latency Now by performing AI
processing at the edge there is a
significant reduction in network latency
since data no longer needs to be
transmitted to the cloud and back this
is particularly beneficial for
applications that demand real-time
responses or decision making let's say
like autonomous vehicles or Industrial
Automation secondly real-time data
analysis it's Computing for AI enables
emea data analysis and inference
directly on the edge devices themselves
this is especially valuable for time
sensitive applications that require
real-time insights or predictions
eliminating the need for Reliance on
cloud connectivity
enhance privacy and security well Edge
Computing enhances privacy and security
by keeping data and air processing local
sensitive information can be processed
on the edge devices without being
transmitted to the cloud minimizing the
risk of data breaches and ensuring
compliance with data privacy regulations
next we have bandwidth optimization Edge
Computing reduces the volume of data
that needs to be transmitted to the
cloud sending only relevant or let's say
summarized data now this optimization
minimizes bandwidth requirements reduces
Network cost and even lightens the load
on the cloud infrastructure in total and
finally it offers offline functionality
Edge Computing enables a models to
function even in situation which limited
or no internet connectivity this
capability is crucial for scenarios that
require continuous operation in remote
or disconnected environments such as
certain iot applications or field
deployments so these were some of the
reasons why we need to deploy AI at the
edge and the benefit it's offering now
comes the main question how exactly does
Edge Computing works well Edge Computing
is primarily focused on the proximity
and location of data processing and
storage the fundamental principle is
simple then it's not feasible to bring
data to a centralized data center the
alternative is to bring the data center
close to the data now in order to enable
machines to perform tasks like let's say
a visual perception object detection
driving cars understanding speech
speaking walking and emulating other
human skills they need to replicate
human intelligence in a functional
manner so for that AI uses a deep neural
network as a data structure to emulate
human cognition these dnns undergo
training in data centers are exposed to
numerous examples of specific tasks or
question type along with their correct
answer and once the training is complete
the model advances to become a inference
engine capable of addressing real world
questions now from there on here's how
it typically Works firstly deployment
kind of inference engine now in AJ
deployments the inferencing Gen which is
the component responsible for making
predictions or performing AI tasks is
deployed on local computers or devices
located in device environments like
factories hospitals cars satellites
homes and much more
problem identification and data upload
now while the inference engine operates
at the edge it may encounter situation
where it struggles to provide accurate
predictions or encounter challenging
scenarios in such cases the problematic
data associated with these instances is
commonly identified and applied to a
centralized Cloud structure now from
there on there is a continuous
cloud-based model training now the cloud
infrastructure typically in a data
center receives the problematic data
from Edge devices data scientists and AI
experts can then utilize this data to
refine and train the original a models
further this involves using the clouds
computational resources larger data sets
and collaboration tools for model
training and Improvement now and finally
with the updated model deployed at the
edge after being retrained the AI system
continues to operate gaining new data
and insights from its environment the
Aja model can collect further additional
data which can be periodically uploaded
to the cloud and further training and
continuous Improvement this feedback
loops enjoy that the AGI models become
progressively smarter over time so this
is in a nutshell how Edge Computing for
AI Works hope you have understood well
let us talk some of the use cases of
edge Computing for AI in real world well
the combination of AI iot and Edge

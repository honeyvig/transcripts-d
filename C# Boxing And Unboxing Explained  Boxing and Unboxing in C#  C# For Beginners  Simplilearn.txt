the process of transforming one data
type to another occurs during the
assignment
automatic tag conversion
occurs in c sharp if the two data types
are compatible
if they incompatible then explicit type
conversion must be performed assigning a
value suitable for n to a long variable
is an example
on that note i am and i welcome you all
to simply learn's youtube channel today
we will be going over the boxing and
unboxing
but first let me remind you that we have
our daily updates on numerous
technologies so if you are a tech geek
looking for the latest technological
innovations then try subscribing to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
the bell icon so you never miss an
update on simply learn
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with the
discussion on what is boxing
for like that
we will have a brief discussion on
unboxing
next we will have a comparison between
boxing and unboxing
following that we will implement what we
learned during this session with a
simple demo
finally we will conclude this session
with a quick pointers on boxing and
unboxing
so now let's get started with the
discussion on what is
boxing first up
boxing is a process of turning a value
type to a object type or any interface
type that this value type implements
many people mistake boxing for
converting a value type to a reference
type although this is not the case
because if that were true that integer
values should be able to be transformed
into a string or an array which are
reference types
next up we have boxing is an implicit
translation technique that employs
object type that is a super type
then we have
when the clr boxes a value type it wraps
the value into a system.object
and saves it on the managed heap
at last
making a duplicate of a value being
boxed is conveyed by a boxing conversion
this is a unique
from a reference type to a type object
conversion
in which the belly continues to point to
the same instance and is just treated as
the lost derivative type object
next up let's discuss what a c sharp
unboxing is
first up unboxing is a technique of
transforming an object type variable
into a value type variable
you must double cast if you want to
unbox an object into a different type
than its predecessor
unboxing is an explicit conversion
process requiring us to explicitly
mention the data type during unboxing
then
you must a double cast if you want to
unbox an object into a different data
type than its predecessor
finally an unboxing operation
involves first determining if the
observed instance is a box value of the
specified value type and then
duplicating the value from the instance
now that we have a good grasp on
concepts like boxing and unboxing let's
have a discussion on the difference
between boxing and unboxing
first let's check the base definition
so boxing is basically a conversion of
value type to an object type
then we have a conversion type boxing is
classified
as an implicit conversion technique
whereas
the unboxing is an explicit conversion
factor
finally let's go over an example
as you can see in boxing we first define
an integer value
and then assign its value to an object
variable obj
now in case of unboxing we are defining
a new integer variable to store the
current object variable
so to do that we are test casting the
object variable to an integer type
now that we are familiar with the
process of boxing and unboxing then
let's go to visual studio code and
implement them
let's start by creating a double
so we will have a double
x
equals to
10.3 then
we can create an object
obj
equals to
x
and now
this process of writing object obj
equals x is called boxing
next
let's try to unbox this back
so we will have
another double
y
equals to
double
x
double obj
now this process is called
unboxing
let's try to print this
so console
dot
write line
and we'll print one
then also have
a console
start
read
line
let's save this and run it
here as you can see it has printed 10.3
now
let's try something different
let's try
typecast this double
into an end
so
let's have this end
and change
this
as you can see it is giving us
an unhandled
exception
that is invalid cast exception
now to get around that
we need to double cast it
so
first
we will typecast this
to our turbo
then we are
retype casting it to an end so that to
store it in y
now let's save it and run it
and as you can see it is now printing
10.
why is it printing 10 instead of 10.3
well because
we have now converted a turbo into an
end and in doesn't have decimal points
so that's why it is printing 10.
let's get back to our slides
finally let's discuss some of the
pointers on boxing and unboxing
first up there are two forms of data
storage in a computer programming a
reference type which keeps tracks of the
location of their values in a place
called a heap
and the value types which simply keeps
the values themselves on the stack
then we have the tank system unification
which gives the value types the
advantages of objectness without adding
unneeded cost
int values are just 32-bit values in
application
that do not require int values to
operate as objects
the functionality is accessible on
demand for applications that require int
values to act as objects this ability to
consider value type as object mediates
the relationship that occurs in most
languages between type values and
the reference types
following that it is a waste of time to
box and unbox something as it decreases
the performance
it should be avoided at all cost
boxing and unboxing can be avoided with
the use of collections like generics
so you can try substituting
list for an error list
at last
exceptions are thrown when a null object
is unboxed or an object is cast as an in
compatible data type

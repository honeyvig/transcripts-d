yeah hi my dear witness and I hope
you're giving your best shot for this
microbiology now I'm going to discuss
about act no mycosis indeed with our
mind map so already I have given lots of
mind maps for most of the bacteria on
your group and I hope you're doing with
the mind maps okay so the second and
most important thing for microbiology
particularly bacteria virus fungus and
parasitoids is the proper mind maps and
a proper nodes with your handwriting
so this nodes can be used for further
rounds of revision and particularly in
the last one month or one and half month
of the preparation which is the key or
heart of the preparation okay so
revision can be done when your stuff is
properly organized with your notes so
straight away I'm going with my mind map
for this bacterium first of all the
first important point to be added please
most of the people they consider these
organisms as transitional forms or the
transfer forms or organisms would stand
in between the bacteria and the fungus
okay they stand in between they they're
considered as the transformation from a
bacteria to the fungus and of course it
is a gram positive non sporulating non
motile no organisms no extra organisms
two organs to move non capsulated not
acid fast and the two important bacteria
are this just making out most of your
questions will move around these two
back here and these are normally present
in your mouth intestine Brezina as a
conscious and the mode of the mode of
entry of these organisms is by the by
the breakdown of the disturbance or or
the crack or the basically the entry of
these organisms into the body is by
breaking the mucosal barrier
in all these areas that is a mouth sorry
that is a mouth intestine and the Vezina
and basically the etiology in most of
the cases can be a trauma a foreign body
or a poor oral hygiene and most of your
case description questions related to
this they can give a description of
recently recently extraction extraction
of trauma trauma to that of the mandible
or recent extraction of impaction or the
most common histories are given
regularly for this infection these are
considered as endogenous infections okay
you can see the sulfur granules ok-sun
red ray like okay so it's the most
common picture based description of this
particular bacteria so next comes is the
clinical features of this and most
commonly seen in ten to thirty years of
age you can consider this as a chronic
granulomatous infection and you can see
injury rates well and you can see clear
in generated swelling at the angle of
the mandible okay so your questions in
your general path even in your general
path this was the most commonly asked
question which was chronic granulomatous
infection you can go for that as
actinomycosis
and the discharge contains the sulfur
granules most of them they give a
beautiful description based question or
they can simply give this diagram and
they can tell upon upon the examination
of the specimen or the biopsy we can
clearly clearly see a sulphur granules
you can directly go for acne or mycosis
as the answer so coming to the clinical
types and few textbooks they give three
clinical types but there are few
textbooks giving it as a for clinical
types
okay the clinical types goes as
following the one is eros serviço facial
which is the most common again this is
the most commonly asked question or a
cervical facial is the most common and
the most common occurence area of this
actinomycosis in the oral cervical
facial is the
angle of the mandible okay so I mean
questions commonly asked what a slump
beach' okay
lumping ja rule and pizza okay the
answer is actinomycosis okay so they can
give a description based question this
is the most common at the angle of the
mandible that is the auto cervical
fascia so the next types goes the type
two is thoracic thoracic is mainly
concerned with the lesion in the lungs
and the pleura and affecting the
pericardium okay all these areas are
involved in the case of the thoracic
type and the next third one is abdominal
type in which the abdominal wall is most
commonly affected okay and following the
last one that is the pelvic type which
is most commonly seen with with with a
woman or people who are using
intrabrand devices and basically you can
see the abscess around around the bone
and the soft tissue and the very
important peculiar feature of this act
no mycosis and the question is chronic
draining sinuses okay so they can ask
you like sulfur granules is a common
finding apart from that multiple okay
multiple sinus openings the multiple
sinus openings or multiple sinus
openings with abscess you can go for
active microcells don't get confused
multiple periodontal abscess is in the
case of your diabetes mellitus okay it's
our most commonly asked questions of
dental students multiple periodontal
abscess if you see an individual in the
oral cavity oral manifestation then you
can diagnose it as diabetes mellitus
multiple pulp stones on radiograph okay
you can you can diagnose fit as a rubber
band syndrome
Robin man syndrome will have multiple
pulp stones on the radiographs multiple
periodontal abscess are seen the case of
diabetes minute I'd assigned multiple
sinus opening split abscess and with the
silver sulfur granules are seen in the
case of your actinomycosis
the most important microscopic feature
that you have to make a notice sulfur
granules you can see that like even if
you're taking the abscess out few times
you can see small small granule like
things okay they are selfish and and
morphologically you can see the bacteria
are long branched mycelium like they
look like a fungus okay so these are the
diagram based things that you need to
focus on particularly for this type of
bacteria you can see in the first
diagram when you're opening your sinus
is opening out and when you are removing
the pus or the discharges you can see
some some sort of sulfur like granules
in this in these patients okay and of
course the most important diagnostic
future microscopically used to identify
this particular organisms is the
presence of sulfur granules okay so
that's an important point to be added
this is the most important future
okay and the next important notes to be
added is the sulfur granules are
bacteria colonies basically which are
found in dense network with
gram-positive filaments okay you can see
this gram positive a filament like
structures okay
and this gives a sunray appearance okay
this gives a sunray evidence okay
so upon radiograph you can see sunray
appearance in osteosarcoma okay in most
of the bone cancers you can see sundry
appearance okay of course
and upon microscopic examination you can
see sundry parents in at you know
mitosis okay
I hope you're clear okay and you can see
the colonies in the form of molars okay
they appear like molar tooth appearance
the colonies appears like molar tooth
appearance you can see molar tooth like
appearance okay I hope you're very clear
this diagram based things one is sulfur
gland is the most important microscopic
method by which you can identify the
next one is called the sunray appearance
is seen in the case of microscopic
picture of these organisms and the
colonies on on on on the agar plate
sorry the colonies on the culture medium
their beards like a monarch tooth like
appearance okay and mostly the granules
of your actinomycosis they appear a low
colored okay they reappeared a low
current okay so these are the very
important points that you have to make a
note particularly to these type of
bacteria so apart from that I want you
guys to make a note about the culture
medium okay the culture medium used for
this bacteria so one is you can use
brain heart infusion agar okay so the
brain heart infusion agar
is one culture medium that is used most
commonly for these bacteria and the
second one is tayo glycolate liquid
medium so one is brain heart infusion
other and the second one is you can use
diode like kool-aid a liquid medium so
these two mediums are used in diagnosis
so apart from the molar tooth like
appearance or sunray appearance or
presence of sulfur granules there are
few cases where you are where you of at
no mycosis can be found as small spider
equalness you can see it here apart from
apart from the sunray appearance you can
you can diagnosis it roughly looks like
a spider spider like colonies okay
spider like koala nice okay so these are
the important points that you have to
make a note related to this particular
bacteria and you can make a note again
this is the most commonly asked question
that is the drug of choice for this is
the pencil ins okay the insulins are the
drug of choice for example if a person
is having a history of allergic to the
pencil in and diagnosed with this
particular disease then you can think of
giving tetracycline okay so these are
the points to bed there is one beautiful
case based question given in your extra
book okay so it's very easy to identify
the case based question is very good and
most of the points whatever we have
discussed right now are already covered
at night okay I'm just going to repeat
it the case based question a 20 year old
woman presented to the surgical
outpatient department with a soft tissue
swelling on the left channel okay which
was painless which was cover covered
with exudate on examination it
discharging sinus was found she has a
history of trauma to that area and the
pus was sent for the culture test
upon macroscopic examination a sulphur
granule was fouled in the exited and
Gram stain of the these granules shows
the presence of some branching
gram-positive filament like structure
and the patient was diagnosis with
cervical actinomycosis i and and the
drug of choice that is given to this
particular patient is the penicillin
i hope we are very clear so this is how
a diagram based a clinical approach
question can be made in this particular
area okay so that is that is that is of
more important okay so just for your
sake i want you guys to add few more
important points this particular disease
actinomycosis is most commonly seen in
ruler areas okay so it's less in urban
areas it is more in the low developed
areas and eng males
okaying male surface ten to thirty years
old are the most commonly affected at
the end males of ten to thirty year-old
are most commonly affected and the
reason for this is not known okay about
60 percentage of the cases are serviço
facial okay and 20 percent is cases are
abdominal okay so that these are the
points to better and out of all the
types of this actinomycosis what we have
discussed pelvic at no mycosis are most
commonly seen in the women because
they're the main reason by occurrence of
pelvic actinomycosis is basically do the
use of intrauterine drugs i hope you are
very clear about this particular
organism okay i'll go back and just have
a quick decent recap okay so these are
gram positive sporulating non motile
sorry grandpa's two non motile non
sporulating non capsulated non acid-fast
and the entries by a trauma or by some
invasion into the body
okay and make a note most commonly seen
in the mails 10 to 30 years of phase
except the pelvic type which is most
commonly seen in the case of females ok
the type 1 that is most common is hora
serviço facial it's also called as lamb
feature it's most commonly seen at the
angle of the mandible and rest all types
of this and questions may move around
this type ok so all these are clear so
diagram based everything is very clear
Maillard shape okay you can spider
spider web-like thing like some rare
parents ok and the culture mediums that
are used and everything drug of choice
is pencil and if it doesn't work or
analytic then you can think of
tetracycline okay thank you so now this

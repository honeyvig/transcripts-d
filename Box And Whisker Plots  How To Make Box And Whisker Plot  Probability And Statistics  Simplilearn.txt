hello everyone
welcome to another interesting video by
simply learn
as you know the graphical variation of
data constitutes a discipline within the
data science universe
this practice has become an important
milestone throughout the history in data
analytics
so keeping that in mind in this video we
are going to discuss an important graph
that is a boss in the risk of plot but
before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
so let's discuss the agenda for this
tutorial
we'll begin this video by discussing
what is box and whisker plot
and some important terms involved with
the box and whisker plot
after this
we'll look into the way in which you can
construct a box and a visco plot by
taking an example
after this we will move on to the python
and see how you can create a box and a
visual plot so without further ado let's
get started
so what are box and whisker plot
a box in a viscous plot is a graphical
representation of variation in a set of
data a histogram analysis is usually
sufficient but a box in a list of plot
can add more detail while also allowing
multiple sets of data to be displayed in
the same graph let us understand the
terms involved here
so the first one is the minimum value is
the smallest value in the data set
the q1 which is the lower quartile is
the value below which the lower 25
percent of the data are contained the
median value is a middle number in a
range of numbers the q3 which is also
the third quartile is the value over
which the about 25 percent of the data
are contained
and at last the maximum value which is
largest value in the data set
now that we know about what is box and
whisker plots
and the key terms that are required to
construct a plot
let's move on to an example to see how
you can construct a plot in the
systematic manner
here we have a sample age of 10 students
at a training center so the first step
would be to arrange the data in the
ascending order the second step is to
find the median of the data set since
there are even number of terms we'll
find the average of the middle two terms
to find the average of the data set
so adding 20 plus 24 and dividing it by
2 we get the average as 22 which is also
the median of our data side
now that we have find our median of the
data set
let's move on to the next step so the
next step is to find the median of the
lower half and the upper half
the lower half median is 19 which is
also the q1 of the data set and the
upper half median is 25 which is the q3
of the data set so our five number
summary will look like this
the minimum value is 15 the q1 is 19
the median which is also the q2 is 22
and the upper half meter is 25 and
finally the maximum value which is 28
now we have all the required values to
make a box plot so let's go ahead and
create one so to create the box plot the
first step would be to make a number
line to the proper scaling
after this you just have to draw the
whisker from q1 to the minimum and q3 to
the maximum age value now that we have
created the box plot let's understand
what these value actually means
so
the lowest age among the students at the
training center is 15 excluding the
outliers
about 25 students are under 19 years of
age and close to 50 percent of the
students are between 19 and 25 years of
age nearly 75 percent of the students
have an age less than 25 and the maximum
age among the students is 28 extremely
outlaws
now that we know how to create a box
plot let's move on to python compiler to
see how you can create a box plot using
a matplot and a numpy library so here i
am on an online compiler so let's start
by importing matplotlib and numpy
library
i plot as plot
import
numpy as
np
now that we have imported both the
libraries
let's generate some random numbers
for that we use the function
random
so np dot random and will limit random
integers
so the first value we are going to enter
is the lowest value our data set can
have
so 0 the 100 will be the maximum value
the data set can have
and there should be 100 terms in our
data set
now
to make a box plot just use the plot
dot box plot function
and pass it to sequence
make sure you spell it right
now
to get the graph use plot dot show now
just run it
you can see we have our box plot ready
so in this way you can create the box
plot in a python so with this we come to
an end of this tutorial
in conclusion you can summarize the data
from multiple sources and display a
result in a single graph
which other graph and visualization
method do you feel is useful let us know

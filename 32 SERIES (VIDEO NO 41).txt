hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss about numerical
scene
oral radiology point number one fill in
size for panoramic radiograph is find it
well or 6 into 12 inches number to fill
him size for little oblique and TMJ uses
5 to 7 inches
number three filling size for
supplementary is 18 to 12 inches number
for swelling size first call radiography
10 to 12 inches number 5 intensifying
screen makes image receptor 10 to 60
times more sensitive to x-rays than the
door for him alone
point number 6 the base material of
intensifying screen sees polyester
plastic which is about 0.25 mm thick
number 7 light emission from lonex trail
earth intensifying screens ranges from
375 to 600 nanometers and Peaks sharply
545 nanometers that is a green color
number 8 a protective polymer coat less
than or equal to 15 micrometers placed
over the phosphor layer in intensifying
screen for number 9 the pH of activator
that is sodium or potassium hydroxide in
developing solution is 10 point number
10 developer replenisher consists of 8
ounces of fresh developer per galloon of
developing solution it is useful to make
30 periapical or 5 panoramic films per
day number 11 the pH of SD fire that is
acetic acid in 6 the solution is 4 point
5 point number 12
safe light should have a frosted 15 watt
bulb or a clear 7.5 watt bulb number 13
safe light should be at least four feet
from work surface area number 14 film
handling under a safe flight should be
limited to 5 minutes because film
emulsion shows some sensitivity
when number 15 manual processing time
temperature is 60 degree foreign heat
and 75 degree foreign heat number 16
master time flies for dental offices of
20 centimeters to 25 centimeters that is
of 8 inches to 10 inches number 17 the
tank holds 3.8 liters of developer or
fixer which is equal to 1 gallon point
number 18 here we are going to discuss
about crossing temperature and relative
development time that is its sixth year
degree foreign heat the developing time
is of five minutes unless 70 degree
foreign heat for and off minutes 72
degree foreign heat 4 minutes 76 degree
foreign heat is of three minutes and at
80 degree foreign he the development
time is 200 minutes
phone number nineteen automatic process
requires four to six minutes to develop
fix wash and dry a film number twenty a
film of great diagnostic value is
between point six to three optical
density units number twenty one minimal
density is called
base plus fog and is soft typically
point 2 to point 3 number twenty two
speed of the film is fourteen to twenty
seven point nine reciprocal draw engines
point number twenty three speed of a
film is twenty eight to fifty five point
nine reciprocal draw engines where a
speed of F film is 56 to one eleven
point land reciprocal dimensions number
25 in ideal radiograph at least two mm
of periapical bone must be visibly
number 26 when placing a CCD or CMOS
sensor remember to account for the two
to 4 mm non-imaging area found at the
end of sensor point number 27 film not
set of film radiographs include 21
radiographs in with 17 or of Perea Pikul
and for off bite wings number 28 in
parallel onion technique central ray is
at 90 degrees to the teeth and receptor
whereas in bisecting angle technique
central rays 90 degrees to the imaginary
bisector
for number 30 here we are going to
discuss about angulations in the
bisecting angle technique for Manx Larry
incisors projection is plus 40 degrees
and for mandibular incisors the
projection is minus 15 degrees for
maxillary canine cities of plus 45
degrees and for mandibular canines is
minus 20 degrees for mites larry
premolars plus 30 degrees and for
mandibular premolars minus 10 degrees
for maxillary molars the projection is
plus 20 degrees and for Magda Blair
Mulas the projection is minus 5 degrees
for number 31 in between projection beam
is angulated plus 7/2 plus 10 degrees
vertically to preclude the overlap of
the cusps onto the occlusal surface
point number 32 the molar
piping receptor is placed 1 or 2 mm
beyond the most distal erupted molar
that's it for today's session guys this
is the third video I made on numeric
dates in oral radiology go and said the
first two videos to note on all these
points and keep on revising them all the
points discussed here are very important
in need and aims point of view all the
best thank you

hello everyone welcome to an amazing
video of simply learn on azure devops
this video will help you understand the
use of devops in azure as well as it
will help you explore the in-depth
services and features provided to you by
azure devops so without doing any
further ado let's start with the video
but before moving ahead please do
subscribe to our youtube channel and hit
the bell icon for more updates from
simply learn
so let's see what we are going to cover
in this video
first we will understand what is azure
devops
followed by features of azure devops
then we will dive into and explore azure
develop services followed by azure
develop server and then we will look
into the azure develop services and
azure develop server differences
and at last we will explore azure
develops labs with proper demonstration
so let's get started
so what is azure devops azure devops
enables teams to organize work
collaborate on code development and
build and deploy applications using
developer services
azure develops the culture and set of
protocols that brings together
developers project managers and
contributors to collaborate on software
development it enables businesses to
create and enhance products more quickly
than they could with additional software
development methods you can use azure
devops services in the cloud or azure
develop server on premises
azure devops has built-in functionality
that you may access via a web browser or
an id client depending on your business
needs you can use one or more of the
following standalone services
azure repos azure develops a building
functionality so for source management
of your code azure repos
offer git repositories or team
foundation version control
azure pipelines build and release
services provided by azure pipelines to
assess continuous integration and
delivery of your applications
azure boards
using kanban and scrum methodologies
azure boards provides a set of agile
tools for planning and tracking for code
bugs and issues
as your test plans manual and
exploratory testing and continuous
testing are among the options available
in azure test plans for testing your
applications
and at last azure artifacts this allows
teams to share packages from public and
private sources including
marvin npm nuget and more and
incorporate packet sharing into their
pipelines so this brings us to the
features of devops
first we have is dashboard control you
can rapidly navigate to different
regions of the project build and manage
dashboards and set dashboard widgets
using the devops dashboard functionality
then we have improved source control git
and team foundation version control a
centralized client server system which
are two prominent methods of source
control supported by azure develop
solution to observe change history you
can add and manage azure git tags
reviews downloads and modify files
following that we have planned and
tracked your work you can utilize azure
devops systems to track features
requirements user stories tasks issues
and more using a variety of work items
then we have integrated collaboration
servers the tool that allows teams to
collaborate throughout the whole azure
develops feature set including team
dashboards project wiki discussion
within work item forms and many others
then we have support for exploratory
testing manual exploratory and
continuous testing are made easier with
azure develop which include workflow
customization end-to-end traceability
criteria-based selection and real-time
visualization that show the test
activities and at last comes continuous
integration and deployment many
developers use cicd and azure devops
makes it so easy to do so developers may
automate various design activities with
azure pipelines including defining and
building association steps writing test
instructions and managing simultaneous
releases
well this brings us to azure develop
services
you get an integrated set of services
and tools with azure develops to manage
your software project from planning to
development to testing and deployment a
client or server model is used to
deliver these services many of them are
offered via a user friendly web
interface that works with all major
browsers the source control bill
pipelines and work tracking are just a
few of the services that may be managed
through a client you can see the left
pane is where you access azure develop
services as demonstrated in the figure
below so now that we have covered azure
develop services
let's move on to azure devops server
version control reporting requirements
management project management automated
bills testing and release management are
all capabilities of azure develop server
a microsoft product it provides devops
features and spans the complete
application cycle so now that we know
what i should develop services and i
should have observer on so let's have a
crisp comparison between them to know
how exactly they differ from each other
despite the fact that azure develop
service is a hosted version of azure
develop server there are several
features that differ some functions of
azure developer server aren't available
in azure develop services
so when deciding which platform to use
or considering a transition from
on-premises to the cloud keep the
following points in mind cope and scale
data authentication
users and groups and manage use access
so first is scope and scale data azure
develop services and azure develop
server are slightly different
organizations and projects are currently
the only alternatives for scoping and
scaling data azure developer services
organization get their own urls and
always have exactly one project
collection whereas deployment project
collection and projects are the three
methods for scoping and scaling data in
azure develop server then we have
authentication to connect to azure
develop services using the public
internet depending on your
organization's arrangement you can use
microsoft account credentials or azure
ad credentials to log in you can also
configure
azure ad to require multi-factor
authentication ip address restrictions
and other security features but you
connect to an intranet serving using
azure develop server windows
authentication and your active directory
domain credentials are used to login so
this method is completely open and you
will never be asked to sign in next we
have users and group you may use a
similar technique to grant access to
groups of users and azure developer
services azure ad groups can be added to
azure develop services group so you must
add users one at a time if you utilize
microsoft account instead of azure ad on
the other hand by adding active
directory groups to multiple azure
developer groups you make grant user
access to deployment in azure develop
server the membership of ad groups are
kept in sync so users gain and lose
access to azure devops server as they
are added and withdrawn in ed and at
last there is manage user access you
manage access to features in azure
devops and azure develop server by
signing users to an access level each
user in your azure develop services
organization
must be assigned an access level as
usual as visual studio subscriber sign
in azure develop services verifies them
so without a visual studio subscription
you can give basic access to five users
for free whereas all use of azure
developer server is on the honor system
specify the access levels on the
administrative administration page to
set access levels for users based on
their license and assign unlicensed user
stakeholder access only so now that we
have covered all the important features
and concepts of azure develop now let's
move on to the next very important
aspect of azure develop which is
azure devops lab
the azure develop lab is a place where
you can learn about software development
and operations with azure devops
services you can simplify and speed up
the devops process it explains how to
use azure develop services to automate
software delivery and satisfy business
requirements so to understand it in a
better way let's have a demo of azure
developer lab so let's start with our
azure develops demo so first what we
need to do is navigate to this
website
ashore.microsoft.in or we can directly
uh log in through
dev.azure.com also so first what we need
to do is sign into a microsoft azure
account
so
after
signing in
you'll be led to this page
you just need to click on continue
and here what you need to do is create
an
organization under which you're gonna
create your
projects
multiple projects and you're gonna
attach your team members to it or group
members to it and you want to get the
access
to your projects
so what is the difference between
organization and project is
if you have given anybody access to your
organization or somebody is a part of
your organization then
then that particular individual will
have access to all of your projects but
if you have given somebody only access
to your project then you'll be only
restricted to that particular project
you won't be able to access any other
project that is present under that
particular organization
that you both are part of so basically
organization is something that is used
to connect to groups of a related
project or somebody who is already a
part of a particular organization so
here we will give it a name so i am
giving
simply
demo
as the organization name
and here you can see that the projects
under this organization will be hosted
under the south india
region
and
we need to enter the capture
and click on continue
just a second
so now you can see this saying that it
is taking you to an organization
okay so we already have an organization
of the same name so let's just change it
to something else
let's give it
simply demo
a large
so here you can see that i see this
thing that if it's taken to your azure
devops organization where you'll be
creating your projects
so now you can see
your organization name
here
and here you just need to create a
project name
so i'm giving it a
simply
demo
project
now below you can see
visibility we can opt either public or
private so what is public or private so
basically
if
you keep it keep the project of
keep the visibility of the project
public
then once
you copy this
url
so
as i was saying once you copy this url
into some other browser or incognito
mode
you will be able to have the access to
the project
but if you keep its visibility private
then only the people who have real
access to your organization or to your
project they'll be able to access that
project or will be able to see that
project or work on it
as you can see uh public projects are
visible for our organization so
we can't uh
select public
so we'll go for private
and click on create project
now here or you can see
the home page of your organization where
you have
this project
and here you can access the statistics
of project how it is performing how much
time you have contributed to it or what
all services you have added to your
project
and down below you will be able to see
that there is just one member which is
the
root user of this project
and
once you start adding more members to
your project it will their details will
be
added to this particular
block so
now here you can see
these are the services boards reports
pipelines test plans
and artifacts services that is
provided to you to add to your
project so
now let's have a
look
at them one by one
so first one is boards
as we click on boards you can see
multiple options
your work items boards backlogs sprints
queries delivery plans
here you can see this all empty as we
haven't added any service or we haven't
worked on our project yet
so let's just click on
new work item
so here you can see one is epic issue
and task
so epic is an option that is uh
you can see a pro
option
for work items
so basically epic represents the
business initiative to be complete and
it is basically available for basis
agile scrum
and cmmi process templates
so what it exactly does is increases
customer engagement that whoever
whatever your project is if it's
the engagement
of your project that how it's performing
and how it is performing towards
the people
whom you have given access to the
project also helps to
create new architecture to improve the
performance of your project
and
it also support mobile applications so
basically when you're deploying any
mobile application in your project or
creating a mobile application as a
project so it will be able to
support that as well
let's click on epic
so here you can see you need to
enter a title for your
epic option
so here you need to add the title of
your effect like
for say
we are creating a health care or an
e-commerce application so obviously it
will be segmented into different parts
like you'll be having search options or
support options
or home page so we just need to give
it a name
and here you can see its state is to do
for now we just have to do because we
haven't
actually created anything in our project
and we haven't given any input
so it's a to-do list and
once we start working on it it gets we
can change the state it
can be in progress or completing
so there are multiple states for your
epic
and here you can see the area is simply
demo project that means that we want to
assign
this
search you know epic into this project
and we can also click description over
here that what exactly our new effect is
about like for search options we need to
specify or give a description that
you know this is for searching options
related to our application like for
healthcare one can type for
medicines
or
doctors
or sloths
so
that is
that that is thing that we can add in a
description
that it will help the user to understand
what this feature is about
so this will epic and
once done we can click on save
so here you can see other
stuffs also like priority
so we can select priority according to
our
will
so here by default it is priority two
so friday basically is
which function will come first
and here you can mention start date
target date
so once it's done you can click on save
now let's move
to the next one
second what we have is issue
so basically issues are
for you to that's your work
and the epics are used to
track the group work and the large
scenarios
but
this is
track like like we saw the project
statistics so it will
help you to understand the individual
progress
so basically issues are raised when
you
find any obstacle in your
progress or in your work so it can be
compared to impediments also so when
you're working with agile or
you need to deal with issues so by
default we have agile
to our project assign
so
like for example we can see that uh
we have a meeting so during the meeting
members report if they have encountered
any bug or any any impairments
so
what next we have to do is we have to
track them and resolve it so these are
the issues that can uh
one can find
like possibilities
so you can assign here
and give it a description again
and just save it so
once a user faces these issues
we can keep a track of it
and
once it is raised we can resolve it
coming to the
next one
next we have is task
by the name only we can uh
well understand what task is
so a task is a smaller item or a
smaller segment to track activity that
contains all the information needed to
accomplish a part of
an issue
or you can say user story requirements
so this option is available for basic
agile scrum and cmmi process templates
so again we can give it a name
what task we want to assign
and give it a description
and according to that we can
select the priority
and save it
so the task will be added to your
project
we are not
assigning any task right now because as
i said we haven't added any
uh particular
project or particular details or
application or we haven't deployed any
application yet in our project
so
that is why we are not adding anything
over here again
because first we need to understand what
these services are and what these
services are used for
next we have backlots
so
backlogs helps you
to understand the flow of your problem
like today you have contributed 10
of
your time and
you have completed the 10 of the work or
you have worked on certain segments of
the project like for
say
you have worked in the support area
so
it helps you
to
understand and keep the track of the
flow of your project how it is
performing and how it is developing and
how it is built every day
next we have a sprint
so sprints are basically a time box
interval that supports your team's
ability
to work using the agile processes and
tools so what you can do is whether
you're having let's say you're having a
healthcare application so you just
need to
have a segment of it and drop it over
here
so what would what it will do is uh it
will get the attention of all the team
members so basically what it does it it
makes your project more manageable
it uh increases the quality of your
project and also makes it work even more
faster and more frequently once you add
the segment to the sprint
so you can see it in one way it gets the
priority and people need to work on it
and it gives the project more
flexibility to adapt to change
now now sometimes what happens is many
associates scrum sprints
with agile software development
so
sometimes
agile are often thought to be the same
thing
coming to the next one we have queries
so the query page basically remembers
the view you have
last navigated
and when you log in again or when you
come back again
to the same portal it returns you to
that very particular view only
so it can
you can say that it runs with azure
devops command line interface
and
all the
open uh like all the pages that you have
gone through you can
keep a track of it over here
you just need to click over here all and
you can just see all the queries you
have
defined
in all this while and
also you can
share the queries with the team members
so they can also know that where you
have been working lately
or which segment you have been working
on
or what was the last navigation
which you have been going through in
this whole project
so it can help you manage your project
in a more efficient way
and keep a track of
how
and what all segments you have been
working on and what are the segments you
need to work on in your project
coming to the next one we have delivery
plans
so here you can see uh we haven't
created any plan yet so basically
delivery plans are a calendar view of
multiple
teams or team backlogs or individual
backlogs from different projects
so basically it replaces the delivery
plans marketplace extension
and it is only available for azure
develop services
so here you can
you can you can say it's a summary or
a time summary of all the projects you
have been working on in a particular
organization
so now that we have covered both uh
let's
move to the next one which is
repose
so with the name itself we can uh well
understand that repo stands for
repositories
so basically it is a set of repositories
that allows you to control and manage
your project code like for say you're
deploying a healthcare application so
these
repos options
help you create repositories and
manage your code of that particular
application and more efficient way
so
what you can do is you can connect
project solutions by using the repos
link
uh as you can see here it is shown
so let's look into its option one by one
first we have files
so in files your project solution will
be available in this section
so
repositories can create manage and
import those solutions
okay so you just need to upload your
solutions
of
code or your project
here and
it will
just create repositories for it
and it will help you create manage those
solutions in a better way
you can see these
clone to your computer push an existing
repository from command line and import
repositories if you want to import any
uh solution
like here you can just
click on import and add the solution to
a repository
so
this is what files
do
basically you can see it say uh it is a
it's like a physical folder itself where
you have all your
mini files or repositories or solutions
you can say of
data so basically it's it functions like
a
physical folder itself
so it helps you keep a track of
your codes and
everything
next comes is comments
so uh
in commit section you can manage commit
history
for your repositories that you have
created and files
so it just commits those uh repositories
with author details from branches like
for say we have a team
one from uh
spot branch and
one from management branch
so
whoever creates that repositories and
have the solution it commits that
repositories under that under that
particular member of the team
with the branch name
then comes pushes
so push histories are available in this
section
from each pull request done by the
developers developers per say the team
members who have been working on this
particular project and creating
repositories and solutions
so what is full request
so full requests or prs are a way to
change or review or merge
code in our repositories
so
basically team uses these pias to review
code and get feedbacks or changes
whether like
for say you are deploying a code or a
solution
so one can review them what all changes
needs to be made or what all application
needs to be made or whether the code is
already fine or not
so basically teams use these prs to
review the solutions and codes storing
these repositories
or
you can merge multiple solutions or
multiple codes into the main branch
so basically the viewers can step
through the proposed changes and leave
those comments
and what to approve or reject that
particular code
or you can say to upgrade or whatever
changes you want to make it they vote
for it that whether that needs to be
made to that particular solution or not
so these are the prs
next
we have branches so
we can manage multiple branching
information in this particular section
you can create create or release
branches
from master to death
okay so all users
can actually
can actually
create or release branches from
branching information available in this
particular section
next come
tags
so
tags are
used to point out specific comments
like uh
giving message tags and data information
to branches you can create your name in
conventions to branches by using
commit tags
and
the second the next one is pull request
which we have already discussed
the pr's that are basically
in pushes
so now we have commit
completed repose also
so let's move on to the next one which
is
pipelines
so here you can see see that we don't
have any pi pipeline
created for us yet so let's have a look
at the
provided options one by one
the first one is environments
so basically it is a collection of
resources where you actually deploy your
application that you're working on
so it contain you can say it contains
one or more virtual machines containers
web apps etc whatever
resources you have actually used for
deploying your application
or whatever services you have used for
creating the environment for the
deployment of your application of course
we need to
deploy our
application and it needs an
windows
java environment so
whatever
resources you need to
create that environment
that will be added to this environment
list that will be listed over
this section
next we have releases option
so basically this
pipeline stores the data of your
pipelines or stages
or
tasks
and
deployments in azure pipelines that
departments you have done so far
in your applications
for your applications actually
so you can say that
it helps your team continuously deliver
software to your customers at a
faster pace
with a very minimum
you can say lower risk
so
if you can fully automate and
automate the testing and the delivery of
your
software or applications
on
multiple
stages
or you can also set up an automated
process with approvals and on-demand
deployments
then comes
library
so again you can see the pages blank
from the name itself you can scrutinize
that will be a collection
of assets from
azure devops projects
so basically it is a collection of build
and release assets of a particular
project
so assets defined in the library can be
used in multiple bills and multiple
releases pipelines of the project
okay so all assets that are defined you
know library share a common security
model
so you can control who can define new
items in a library and you can use an
existing item that you have already
added in this library
roles are defined for eye library items
for say you have added a particular
asset a particular item
to this library segment
and you can assign a particular member
who will be working on this item
okay so
the roles are defined here for these
and these governs the operation you can
perform on those items
that person will be keeping track of
whatever changes have been made
or whatever upgradation has been made to
the particular item that has been added
to this
segment library segment
so then comes task groups
so
task groups are a way to standardize and
centrally manage deployment steps for
all applications
in your projects
so when you include a task group in your
definition and then make a change
centrally to the task group the changes
automatically reflected in all the
definitions
so we can conclude with this that a task
group allows you to encapsulate a
sequence of tasks
already defined in
you can say build or release pipelines
or into a single task group
so it just encapsulate all those
sequences of task
so you can choose to extract the
parameters from those encapsulated tasks
as configured variables
and
abstract the rest of the task
information
so what happens is the new task group is
automatically added to the task catalog
and it is ready to be added to other
release and build pipelines
so task groups are stored at the project
level and are not accessible outside the
projects group so
the task groups
will be only limited to the members who
you have assigned in this project and it
won't be
accessible to the other people or other
team members from different projects
even though they are
the member of the same organization so
you can say it's more of a private
segment
now that we have covered task groups
next we have deployment groups
so
deployment groups are only available
with classic release pipelines
and it is totally different from the
deployment jobs
it is basically a collection of
deployment related steps
defined in a yaml file to accomplish a
specific task
so
in nutshell it is a logical set of
deployment target machines
that have agents installed on each one
the deployment groups represent the
physical environment for example
testing or development or production
environment
so a development group is just another
grouping of agents much like an
agent pool you can say
so what you can do with this is you can
specify the security context and runtime
targets for the agents or you can
let yourself view live logs for each
server as a deployment take place
or you can also enable you to use
machine tags to limit deployment
to a specific set of
servers
so this was about deployment groups now
that we have covered one more service
let's move on to the next one that is
test plans
so
test plans the first one we have
is progress report
so you can
analyze with this only the progress
report will be the
progress of the
project you have been working on or the
deployments you have been
doing or the tasks you have been
performing
so
so basically it lets you
analyze and view data for
more than one or an individual test
plans in a particular project
so data for test plans in migrated can
be migrated from
an on-premises azure develop server
that won't show up in this report
okay so basically this section lets you
drill down by each test plans and give
you summary of each test
plan in it
the section also lets you to navigate to
a test plan or shoot of choice by double
clicking on it okay
so
this was the progress report next we
have
runs
so basically it represents the execution
of pipelines
during the run the pipeline is processed
and agents process one or more jobs
so when you run a pipeline many things
happen under the copper while you often
won't need to know about them
occasionally
it's useful to
have the bigger picture right
so
azure
pipelines
will get processed under this
test runs
segment so you will be able to see water
performance
is happening over here like while you're
running a pipeline you can see
uh the running state
the date you have started that
or what all that
running pipeline includes like jobs
steps and tasks
runs power both continuous integration
and continuous delivery pipelines
next we have
load test
so basically assure load testing is a
fully managed as azure service
that enables developers and testers to
generate high scale load with custom
apache j meter strips
and gain actionable insights
to catch and fix performance bottlenecks
at scale
basically application performance and
resiliency are more important than ever
before
so how you can
run an azure devops test
so first you need to click on it and
select a test suit that contains all the
automated tests
and
you can just choose the run test option
and it will start processing it so the
service this service basically simulates
traffic for your application
you can say regardless of
on which platform or
where it is actually hosted
so now that we have covered test plans
as well let's move on to the next one
that is artifacts so this is the last
service that is provided to your project
by azure devops
so artifacts is a
product produced during the software
development process
so it mainly consists of the project
source code dependency or binaries or
resources
that could be represented in different
layout depending on the particular
technology
so it's like an extension that makes it
easier
to discover install or publish
and may even packages in azure devops
it's basically deeply integrated with
other hubs like build so that package
management can become a seamless part
for your existing workflows
so what is exactly it is used for
so it
basically it can be used
for both public and private organization
with teams of any size it
it basically
manages your
npm or
new get packages via feeds and it allows
you to create and share your making
it's a package management solution
indicated with your azure device
this was all about the services that is
provided to your projects so now that
you know what all services
do for your project and what are their
benefits and how they function now you
can actually plan your project and start
creating and working on it and start
deploying with the users and
what all services you want for your
particular project so what you can do is
click here on project setting
just a second
you can just click on
project settings
so now what you can do is you can add in
description that uh what your actual
project is about so for say like i said
if you're creating you know a health
care application so you can just give me
the description that it is related to
issues queries and the helps needed and
like you're trying that particular
application with different hospitals or
healthcare organizations so you can
actually add those
information in this description
and the process which basically it is
basic or private one
but you
do get a range of
process
for your project when it depending on
the visibility of it like for a child or
scrum you can say
so now here you can see that only my uh
id is
attached to it as i'm the only member
here and i'm the administrator so you
can add members
here
and
scrolling down you can
now that you know what all services
uh provide you or what they provide to
your project depending on the need of
your project you can just uh select the
services you want to assign to your
particular project like per se if i
don't want both assigned to it or
you can say if i don't want the
services provided by the code
pipelines
artifacts but i don't have
uh test plans and boards as you can see
basically all the
collection of whatever you're managing
which is indirectly assigned to the
boards
so as
you remove the both the test plans also
get
removed
okay
and once
like this you can just
select what all services you want
and
if you want to delete your project you
can just go ahead and delete it
so this was all about
azure developer services
and i'll show them what the studio you
can see and how the demonstration of
how a project actually functions in this
virtual studio
well this was all about azure devops

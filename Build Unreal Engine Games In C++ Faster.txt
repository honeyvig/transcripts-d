ever wanted to write your own game and
did you know that you could write it in
visual studio with ease find out more on
this episode of Visual Studio toolbox
[Music]
hello everyone and welcome to another
episode of Visual Studio toolbox I'm
your host Leslie Richardson and today
I'm excited because we're gonna be
talking about video games today so
joining me is David Lee from the C plus
team who's going to be sharing how we
can all be more productive developing
games in digital studio with C plus plus
hey David
hey Leslie how's it going I'm good how
are you doing great I'm super excited to
show everyone some of these Unreal
Engine Integrations that we have been
building in Visual Studio
sweet so before we dive in would you
care to tell us a little bit more about
yourself and what you typically work on
of course so um as you said before I am
in the C plus plus team uh I am the game
developer product manager in visual
studio so everything from building games
in Visual Studio to msvc compiler for
all of you watching
um just send me a tweet my my Twitter
handle is there at the CBP PPM for any
feedback
so yeah
awesome
right so video games very popular Topic
in the development world I know a lot of
people initially started coding just
because they wanted to write their own
games and stuff so
can you tell us a little bit more about
um you know how
developing video games can have its
challenges and maybe what using visual
studio and C plus can do to alleviate
some of that
yeah Leslie
um
I've chatted with quite a lot of game
developers out there and really
understand their needs so from in the
developers to students to all of our
first party game developers and you know
as more I learned in our lessons a lot
of pains have circuits from game
development I think one of the biggest
things that I've heard is
the mental task switching a lot of
developers out there when they work on a
game whether it's using their
proprietary engine or um or Unreal
Engine
sometimes they have to switch back and
forth between visual studio and you know
each time you
open up the unreal editor switch back to
visual studio and then close it that
takes time and instead of having a
smooth flowing
um work then you're you give a lot of
unnecessary mental energy by getting
distracted and not be as productive
so this is one of the few things that
the team at C plus plus in Visual Studio
has set out to tackle
awesome yeah I I can relate I did write
like one video game in college and
specifically I was using a combo of
unity and I think IntelliJ at the time
and it's just having to jump between
those back and forth neither were like
seamlessly incorporated into the other
was definitely time consuming especially
when your game is a buggy mess and
you're trying to deal with that you know
yeah would you care to show us how
Visual Studio can save the day in that
sense and you talk about unreal which is
going to be the focus for today right
yes so today we're going to be focused
on Unreal Engine specific features that
we have built in visual studio
um just to give everyone a brief
overview we'll be going over how to see
if blueprint references in visual studio
um there we have added code analysis we
have added Unreal Engine lock streaming
so all those things you don't have to
keep going to the Unreal Engine editor
for
um including adding a class there's a
few templates out there
um so quite a lot of features that we're
introducing in Visual Studio 2022 17.5
with some of the features currently in
preview in 17.6 preview 1.
um yeah to get started
um I definitely want to show everyone
how to enable these
features so one of the things that is
absolutely needed for uh for you to see
on blueprint references is the visual
studio integration tool
um it is an Unreal Engine plugin so here
I'm going to show you two steps to get
your sources
so one is
from GitHub
we have open sources
plug-in on GitHub so
we welcome Community to contribute to
this extension
and you can
if your project has a custom Unreal
Engine or
um if the marketplace installer doesn't
work
um this is the way to get
um get your features working
so the simplest way is there's a whole
bunch of instructions so you're going to
read me but basically you just clone
this extension make sure the plugin is
enabled in numero engine and you should
be all set to go
now for most of you out there
um you might find installing it
through the Unreal Engine Marketplace a
little bit easier
so in the Unreal Engine Marketplace the
tool is called Visual Studio integration
tool is published on Microsoft and all
you gotta do is download and we support
um a real 4.27 and the newest revenge of
5 versions so once you've downloaded
this
um you go to your unreal editor and make
sure you enable this
integration tool
um for if you have any issues whatsoever
we do have a troubleshooting page
so
it's on the GitHub
there's this troubleshooting section and
there are some common steps you can take
to basically diagnose any potential
issues you might run into
so without further Ado let me switch
over to visual studio
so Leslie have you played with Unreal
Engine before I have not I'm more of a
Unity
person or I've been more of a Unity
person in the past
yeah I
I am by no means a game developer I know
a little bit on my own time
um but I think one of the things that we
heard from our developers is
um blueprints is a virtual scripting
language you can use to build your game
um with bigger production games
eventually you want to
migrate those blueprints to actual C
plus plus code
um for
example you can prototype something
really quick in Blueprints and when you
find out the thing works
um you ask your devs or yourself to
refactor and remove the blueprint and
previously
the only way to see your blueprints was
to open up the Unreal Engine editor
um and go and search for your blueprints
here we have added some koblin's hits
so you can see
right here class lyricame API by the way
this is one of the unreal sample
projects
once you click on blueprint references
you'll get a list of blueprints and
their Associated asset packs
that's awesome so before you just had to
go back into the Unreal Engine and just
double check
um what group what blueprints in there
correct area paths that you needed
exactly yeah
if you
um you had to wait
which you know it's not good to wait
so
if you see These Blueprints and they
have Associated asset paths you can
actually double click on them
and see your asset information
so here we have some properties uh with
different categories
um you know you can
collapse them you can sort
you can even filter out what you want to
see so here's a list of all the things
if this list gets too long
um so this is a great way to reference
um your blueprint usages without going
to the armo editor that's awesome I love
I'm loving the integration
definitely not having to swap between
two different pieces of software in this
case yeah
so
before we
um talk about another feature I
want to show that if you might need to
refresh your blueprints to do so is
under the project menu
and here
rescan blue UD blueprint for your
starting name
all right so which is your your data and
stuff
I'm sorry does that just refresh your
data like have you updated and um unreal
while you have this blueprint yeah I'll
refresh
to if we do that
um so another thing I wanted to show you
is we added some code analysis into
um
into Visual Studio
um
this first round of code analysis
leverages the unreal header tool which
here it's basically a tool that is
used one billion Unreal Engine game
um let's say you make some mistakes and
you don't even call this super important
on real macro
um once you hit save
the color analysis are run the unreal
header tool and give you some hints of
why things are not working so here you
can see purple Squid goes
it says unreal header tool unknown
specifier so there before you even
compile you can see to save you some
time that this is not the right thing
right this super important macro
for example
it says expected and a generated body
functioning at the start of the class
that's because I commented out but you
know typically you might make some
mistakes that not catch until compile
time
analysis is designed to save your time
so the next feature that I want to show
you is also in this whole realm of oh
let's not rely on the unreal editor I
just want to
stay in Visual Studio
in this next
um feature that I want to show you is
the UE lock streaming so now you don't
even have to go look inside your unaro
editor for any logs
um in this line 543 I've added a UE lock
to capture every time we shoot the
weapon
um you have some log taxes
so let's run this
and boot up
the game
yeah so
while that's building I mean it is
really nice to just to see little things
like just being able to check your logs
in visual studio and all these other
things you're just not constantly
swapping back and forth right
right
going back to the um the assets page
like when you double clicked on a
blueprint it displayed all the data
related to the blueprint can you
or are there plans to if not already are
there plans to be able to update your
data via that window
um they're not current plans
um I think typically the you don't need
to refresh that many times
um
but um if the community wants it we will
build it awesome
cool here's the unreal editor building
up
all right now we're in the game Let's
Play and
try to win this game
oh no
that was quick
actually
so let's go back to video studio
um as you can see here um different now
there's a new window called UE log
preview here
we can have two options for you
um with all the logs that's generated
throughout your entire game you can now
filter it
um remember we the log we added is log
Lara ability system
unselect everything select this
and then look
every time I shot
it says PPP
and of course
if you want to see more of the logs you
can also check this
verbosity option to really display what
whatever you need
yeah
that is
really
um
this really Nifty definitely just to
have
your typical console logs and stuff all
in one spot like you know you're already
using a lot of vlogging to debug chances
are so
making sure it's all in one spot instead
of having to add the extra time it takes
to again go back to unreal
and if you um if you for some reason
close the window and you can find it um
it's in view
other windows
and UE lock so if you click this then
you can see the login
excellent
um so let's
let's talk about another thing that I
have learned with um when talking to
um all the unreal developers is a real
engine has a lot of complicated macros
um I'm real engine there's unique macros
everywhere
but previously you can have a macro for
example something like this a u-function
you have to remember every
um all the parameters you need to put in
but now if you
hover over this we have
we have added macro expansion
and when you say macros can you explain
what you mean by that
yeah these macros are
um instead of typical functions
um Unreal Engine uses
um a bunch of
heavy macros one by line
um
in order to achieve a lot of a lot of
things more quickly than you know
writing lines and lines of code
awesome
so this is an example of a pretty
complicated macro that previously
um you weren't able to see the entirety
of it
so now you can either expand online or
copy so you can paste it to another
um their editor window
and
so you don't have to remember all the
things that it needs for example
see your function we have some of the
other
maybe you property macro
so these are the macro expansions that
we have added
um
the last thing I want to show you is
um how's it out of class and now we've
been on
Unreal Engine 5 for quite a while
um let's switch over to a Unreal Engine
4 project
so the classic action RPG you can see
all of the
um all the features here work you can
see your blueprints
you can see um your app get information
but you can also add class
once again we heard from developers
it used to be that you have to open up
the unreal editor add a specific
C plus plus class and then open up
visual studio again but now you can
right click on your solution Explorer
add
UE class
and we have provided four templates for
you to choose from so for example if I
add I want to want to add a new part
let's just say my Pawn click add
um you can see the path information
once you click OK because studio will
generate that template file for you
um in both the C plus and the header
files
so file modification detected we click
reload all
and now if you see in the solution
Explorer my pawn and cpp.mypawn.h
awesome
yeah so so dang you even had to create
your classes via unreal first before uh
playing around with them in BS
yeah
um a lot of the things I showed everyone
today was only achievable in the unreal
order but yeah unreal like once and that
was just to play the the game so that's
really exciting just to be able to stick
to one spot
right
yeah so I think this is all the features
that we have today
um the team is working hard to build uh
more and more of unreal integration into
visual studio so if you have a great
idea please let us know on developer
Community or you can even trade at me
well great so if people want to go learn
more about how you can get started
writing your own C plus games or using
the Unreal Engine within Visual Studio
you can get started with all the links
that we're posting Below in the
description so take a look at that and
start making your own games yeah there
is
um a block that I've wrote I'm
describing in more detail about holidays
Integrations
um that is now available in digital
Studio
good stuff
well David thank you so much for being
on the show I can't wait to see what
comes next for game development and C
plus plus and how it just integrates
itself into Visual Studio that's really
exciting
and yeah
thanks think again David
thanks Leslie I'm happy to be here
sweet and thanks for joining us audience
and with that happy gaming and happy
coding
[Music]
thank you

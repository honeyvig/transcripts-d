hey everyone this is harsh bhardwaj and
welcome to this c plus plus tutorial for
beginners by simply learn
in this session we will learn about
history of c plus uses of c plus plus
programming language its features then
we learn about variables and types after
that we will cover arrays in c plus plus
later we will go through loops in c plus
plus then switch case statements
followed by strings then there are
functions in c plus plus then pointers
after that oops concept and finally we
learn about recursion
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go ahead to our first topic
that is history of c plus plus
c plus plus programming was created by
john strawstrom in 1979 at bell labs
it was created as an extension to the c
programming language the goal was to add
object oriented features to the c
language
and back then it was called
see with classes
in the year 1982
several new features were added
the most important were virtual
functions operator overloading constants
single line comments etc
and the name of the language is changed
from c with classes to c plus plus
here plus plus is the increment operator
which gives the idea that c plus plus is
evolved from the c language
now coming to uses of c plus plus
c plus plus programming language has
many uses
some of them are
it is used in developing operating
systems operating systems like windows
mac operating system etc all of these
have some parts that are written in c
plus
c plus helps in making web browsers it
helps the browsers to carry out the task
with speed and efficiency
mozarella firefox google chrome safari
are some examples of it
c plus plus is widely used for
developing games because it is fast
programming language
c plus plus is used for creating games
like counter strike and gaming consoles
like xbox and playstation
c plus plus is generally used for
embedded systems like medical devices
tvs smart watches etc it helps the
programmers to control how these systems
run more efficiently
now moving forward to features of c plus
c plus plus is regarded as simple
language because it has a rich library
with a variety of data types and its
syntax is almost similar to c language
c plus is object oriented programming
language that makes it easier to manage
and features like polymorphism
abstraction etc helps in making the
application secured and efficient
c plus is portable language we can
easily write the same code on different
operating systems but it is not fully
platform independent like java
it has both the features of low level
and high level language it can easily be
used to develop applications or software
based on the required level of
programming language
and that is why it is called mid-level
language
c plus programming language is way
faster than any other programming
language its compilation time and
execution time is fast
memory management is easy in c plus it
supports dynamic memory allocation and
we can free memory anytime we want by
using the free function
c
has rich library it has a lot of inbuilt
functions that helps in programming by
making things easy for developments and
save time for development purpose
now let's learn about variables and
types
a variable in c plus is used to store
values and every variable has a data
type
some of the basic data types includes
integer
double
character
float and next is void
so let's start
integer
this data type is used when we want to
store numeric values like 2
4 5 8 20 30 etc
second is double or double floating
point
this data type is used for storing
double preceding floating point values
example
24.75
5.94 etc
next is character
as the name suggests character data type
is used for storing characters for
example a b c etc
then there is float or floating point
this data type is used for storing
single precision floating point values
for example 2.1 5.7 4.2 etc
next is void
this word data type is used when there
is nothing to return
in mind that every variable is declared
with its type
now syntax of variable is
data type of variable
then the name of the variable
here int num is the example
and over here in the integer variable
var
we are storing the value 10
and in character variable ch we are
storing the character e
now let's move to arrays in c plus
an array can be defined as collection of
variables of a similar data type
that are stored sequentially
it is easy to access elements of an
array using its index number
and each element of the array is
identified by the index number which
starts from 0.
elements are placed at these index
numbers for example first element of
array that is 12 is stored at index 0
and second element that is 4
is at index 1 and so on
the syntax for array declaration is type
then array name
along with the size of array
here type is the data type of elements
that are stored in the array
array name is the name of the array
and size is the number of elements that
are stored in the array
now
coming to loops in c plus
loops are repetition control structures
that are generally used to repeat the
block or section of code instead of
repeating the entire code
there are three types of loops in c plus
plus
for loop
while loop and do while loop
so let's start with for loop
for loop is used when we know the exact
number of times the loop should repeat
its syntax has three parts
initialization
condition and updation
first the initialization take place
in this part we initialize and declare
loop control variables
this part takes place only once
second part is condition
in this part the condition of the loop
is evaluated if it's true then only the
body of loop executes
once the condition evaluates to be true
and the blue body is executed
then updation takes place
this part
increments or decrements loop variables
for example here in i equal to 0 is
initialization
i less than 10 is the condition and i
plus plus is the updation
now next is while loop
this loop is used when we don't know the
exact number of times the loop should
repeat
this loop execution terminates based on
the test condition
the syntax while loop is
while keyword and the test condition
in this part the condition is checked
if it's true
then the body of loop executes and goes
to the updation part
the updation part is responsible for
continuation of loop
this part increments or decrements the
loop variable
for example
here first we have initialized variable
n with 0
and then we have used while loop and put
the condition n less than 4
now the loop will execute till the value
of n is less than 4
and after every iteration the value of n
will increment because we are updating
it using the increment operator
coming to do while loop
in do while loop test condition is at
the bottom of the loop and the body of
loop comes before the test condition
hence the body of loop execute at least
once before the condition is even
evaluated
this loop is used when we don't have the
idea about the number of iterations and
the loop must execute for it at least
once
its syntax is do block and after the
block there is while with the condition
this do block executes first before the
condition is checked and after that the
condition of while is evaluated
if it's true then only the loop will
further execute
it means even if the condition is not
true then also the loop will execute for
once
now coming to switch statements
switch statements helps in checking the
quality of variable against some number
of values and these values are called
cases
it compares the value of the variable
with these cases and whichever case
matches with the variable that
particular case will execute
this is the syntax for switch case
statement here variable is the one for
which the comparison is to be done
case refers to the different cases with
which the comparison will take place
break keyword prevents the execution
from going to the next case statement
now coming to strings in c plus
a string is a sequence of characters
they are used to represent text in the
program
there are two types of strings
c style strings and string class
c style strings in c programming the
collection of characters are stored in
the form of arrays
c plus plus also allows this style
it is a one dimensional array of
characters followed by a null character
now string class
c plus plus string is an object of
string class
this is a part of standard namespace
and is defined in the header
let's have a look at the syntax
c style string declaration
care keyword then the name of string
and size inside the brackets then there
are four characters
s a m i semi following a null character
the size of string is 5 the one extra
space is for holding the null character
now in order to use string class of c
plus we must include string as a header
the syntax is string keyword
the name of string
then we can write whatsoever string we
want to store for example here we are
storing semi
now let's move on to c
functions
functions can be defined as a group of
statements designed to perform specific
tasks and return an output
we can also pass arguments to the
function
the intent of the function is to combine
common task and perform them
we can invoke the function by calling it
using the name of the function and round
brackets
these are user defined functions
we can also pass arguments to the
function if you want to
the syntax of a function definition is
data type
along with the function name then
arguments inside the brackets
every c plus program has at least one
function known as main function
this is where the execution of program
starts from
there are both built-in and user-defined
functions in c plus
the built-in functions are in the c plus
standard library if you want to use them
then we can simply call them
now let's have a look at this example
in this example over here we are
defining the function add is the name of
the function integer is the data type
and n1 and 2 are the arguments
this function is doing the addition of
two variables and is returning the
output
and inside the main function we are
calling this add function and passing
the arguments
coming to pointers in c plus
pointers can be defined as reference to
a variable it holds the memory address
of another variable
now this memory address is a particular
location in a computer's memory
where the data is stored and the pointer
stores these memory addresses
pointers must have the data type that
matches with the reference variable
the reference operator returns the
memory address of the variable and the
dereference operator displays the value
that is stored at that memory address
the syntax of the pointer is
data type
then the dereference operator with the
variable name
now coming to object oriented
programming
object-oriented programming or oops is a
programming model that uses the concept
of classes and objects
in oops programming revolves around
objects rather than logic and functions
now let's have a look at the oops
concept
that is polymorphism inheritance
encapsulation
abstraction
let's start with polymorphism
polymorphism is the ability to perform a
task in more than one way
it provides different meanings to
operators and functions or in other
words it redefines the way how things
work
next is inheritance it can be defined as
a process in which one object acquires
all the properties and behavior of a
parent object
the inherited class is called base class
and the class that inherits is called
the derived class
now coming to
encapsulation
it can be defined as binding data
variables and functions together into a
single unit now coming to abstraction
abstraction can be defined as hiding the
internal details and showing the
functionality to the user
in c plus it is easy to access class
variables and methods and abstraction
keeps them hidden from direct access
now moving to the last topic that is
recursion
recursion can be defined as a process in
which a function calls itself again and
again until a certain condition is met
we can define the condition using if
else statements or similar approaches
for example here we are calling a
function named data which is calling
itself again within the same function
here we are calling the function data
and here is the function data calling
itself
this part where the function data is
calling itself is called recursive call
and
the part where we are calling data
function from the main
function is function call
so as we have covered all these topics
so let's go ahead and do some examples
on these topics in our code editor that
is vs code now here we will do a basic
example of array in which we declare and
initialize an array and print the
elements of array using for loop
so let's start
first of all let's create a new file
now let's name this file
c plus plus tube dot cpp
so first of all we'll include the header
files
hash include iostream
then we'll use using namespace standard
now we'll write int main
now we'll declare and initialize an
array
the array name is err
the size of array is 5
and now the elements of array
let's write 12
40
22
any random elements 75
and 80
all right
now
[Music]
we'll write the for loop because we want
to print the elements so we have to
write for loop and i equal to 0 we'll
initialize the for loop with 0
then we put the condition
i less than
5 which is the size of array
i plus plus increment operator
now we'll display the elements to
display those elements we'll write arr
and inside the bracket we'll write i
after that and line
here we are printing array of i
this means one by one each and every
element from 0 to five will get printed
as the loop will execute further
like first zero will be there
then
one index will be there then two index
three index four index up to five
so one by one all the elements of array
12 to 80 all the elements will be
printed
now after that let's try to return 0
and let's try to run this program
we'll press this play button
to run the program
so here is our output
elements 12 40 20 to 75 80.
these are the elements which you want to
print
so this is how we can do it
and if we want to print a particular
element as well so we can do that also
all we have to do is to write the index
number of that particular element
let's say i want to print 40 so i will
write the index number of 40 which is
one
now
i'll save this by pressing ctrl s
and now i'll run this
here it is
40 40 40 it is because
we are using the for loop so that is why
it is printing 45 times but if we don't
use for loop
let's say
and now if we try to run this by
pressing ctrl save
and
running the program
see the output here it is 40.
as you can see we have wrote the index
number of a particular element
and that element is getting printed
let's try
three
at index 3 we can see 75 is there 0 1 2
3 75
is the element at index 3
so let's save it and run again
75 will be printed
here it is 75
now let's move on to our next example
let's create a new file
and let's name it
c plus plus
tute
2 dot cpp
we'll save this
okay now here we will do a program
of array in which we will do the sum of
all the elements of the area
so let's start
first of all hash include iostream enter
file
now using namespace standard
now we'll write the main function
and we'll initialize an array
two
i'll write random numbers to four
uh 10
8
3
11
and again 2.
all right now
there are total seven elements then i'll
write
the size equals seven
we can also take the input from the user
but let's do it in this way
all right now
we'll declare a variable sum and
initialize it with zero
now we'll write the for loop
now we'll initialize it with zero
i less than size
which is the size of array
now we'll increment the loop i plus plus
now
as we know that we have initialized the
variable sum equal to 0
because we want to store the sum of all
the elements of array into this variable
so let's write down sum equals
sum plus
array of i
now here one by one all the elements
from zero to the size of the array that
is 7 all the element
will be added to this sum variable one
by one
so
now let's print this variable
we'll write the message the sum
[Music]
of
array is
sum variable
now
return 0
over here from 0 to
7 all the elements will be added to this
sum variable we know sum is 0
but when 2 will be added then the sum
becomes 2 and then 4 will be added to it
then 10 will be added to it so as 8 3 11
and 2. so one by one all the elements
will get added to the sum variable and
here we are printing the sum variable
so let's see how it works
now let's save this by pressing ctrl and
s together
and now let's try to run this program
as you can see the sum of array is 40
so let's count
2 plus 4 6 6 10 16
16 plus 8
equals 24
24 plus 327
27 plus 11 equals 38 plus 240
so this is the right answer
so now let's do another example of if
else statement
so let's make a new file
we'll go to new file and let's name it
tut3 dot cpp
we'll save it
now we'll write the hash include
iostream
now we'll write the namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
in this program we'll use the if-else
statement
to check whether the person is senior
citizen or not
so let's start
first of all we'll declare the variable
age
so now we'll take the input from the
user
so we'll ask them to enter the age so
we'll write the age variable
the user entered the age now we'll use
the if condition
that if the age of a person
is greater than
60
then
will print the person is senior citizen
so let's write
person is
senior
citizen
we have put the condition age greater
than 60 and so it means that if a person
enters
the number greater than 60 then he is a
senior citizen
okay now
in the else block
will print
the person is not a senior citizen
person
is not
a senior citizen
now we'll write return 0
so this is a basic example to understand
if else statements so let's try to run
this program but let's first save it by
pressing ctrl and s together
now let's
run this program
so here we have to enter the age of the
person let's say the age of the person
is 67
and now we'll press enter
as you can see person is a senior
citizen we can see
now
let's try
to run it again
now this time we'll enter the age 50.
so here we can see person is not a
senior citizen when we enter 50 age
all right so this is
the right output
so let's do an example of for loop
let's name this one as
for
dot cpp
let's save it
now here we will do an example in which
we will enter a number and the sum of
all the numbers up to that number will
be its output for example let's say we
have entered 4
so its output would be 4 plus 3 plus 2
plus 1
that is equal to 10 the sum of all the
numbers up to that number
so let's start we'll do this example
with for loop and while loop as well so
let's start it
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
right and main
now
we'll declare two variables into num
and
end sum and initialize sum with zero
all right
now
we'll display a message that enter a
positive number
and we'll take the input
num
all right
now here we have to write the for loop
because we want to do the sum of all the
numbers
so we have to write for keyword
and i equals one
we'll start with one
i
less than equal to num
this is the condition
and this is the
updation
now
all we have to do is write sum equals
sum plus
i
because we know that we have initialized
sum
as 0 earlier and
the loop is running from i equal to 1 up
to the number we have
entered like let's say 5 then the loop
will run from 1 to 5
and sum is 0
so when 1 will be there then sum becomes
1 and then plus 2 that is 3 plus 3 that
is
5 up to so on so this is the way how
this loop will work
now
after this all we have to do is to print
the sum variable
so we'll write first of all we'll write
sum
equals
and now some variable
and l
now at last return 0
now let's try to run this
and first
we'll save it by pressing ctrl ns
enter a positive number
all right
let's say
5
sum is 15 so let's check
1 plus 2 equals to 3 3 plus 3 equals to
6 6 plus 4 equals to 10
and 10 plus 5 equals to 15 so this is
the correct output
so this is how we can do this example
with the help of for loop
now let's try the same example this
example only with the help of while loop
so
let's remove this part
now
we'll write
while keyword
and num
which is the variable
that is the positive number that is
entered by the user
will write not equal to
zero
explain this
now
here we'll write sum equals
sum
plus
num
and then
num equals to num
minus 1
here what we are doing is
we have taken the input from the user
that is num let's say it is 5
and we have put the condition inside
while that num not equal to 0
and inside the loop we have used the
decrement we are decrementing num by 1.
so 5
will be added to the sum variable which
is initially 0
after that num will be decremented as we
can see num equal to num minus 1 so it
will become 4 and now
4 is added to sum
so sum becomes 5 plus 4 equal to 9
and then again
num will decrement and this goes on
till num becomes equal to 0 because in
while loop there is a condition saying
the loop will keep on repeating till n
is not equal to 0
and when it becomes equal to 0 the loop
will terminate
so now let's try to run this program
by pressing ctrl s and now
click on this play button
enter a positive number
let's write 5 again
to check whether it is
so it's correct sum is 15
so this program can be done with the
help of for loop as well as while loop
and let's move to another example
so now let's do one another example
in this example we'll simply swap two
numbers
using function
so
let's save this first of all name it c
plus plus
two
four
dot c people
so let's start with header files
hash include iostream
now namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
inside the main function first of all we
will declare both the variables
n1 and n2
now
we'll display a message saying that
enter two numbers that you want to swap
so we'll write enter
two numbers
that you want to swap
all right
now we'll take the input from the user
of those two numbers so we'll write
n1
n2
c in n1 n2 here we are taking the input
from the user
now
all we have to do is to display the
numbers that we have taken the input off
from the user because we want to compare
it later
so let's write
n1
and
and one variable
after that end l so that
looks good
now
same for n2 will do
now we have to call a function let's
name that function swap and we'll create
that function later onwards
and
in this function we are passing the
arguments n1 and n2
this is the calling part now we have to
create
we have to define the function
so let's start we'll write void which is
the data type swap
is the name of the function
now inside the function
we are
writing the arguments int n1 n2 which we
have passed from swap over here
these are those arguments
now here we will swap the both the
numbers
for that we have to create a temporary
variable t
and now
will pass the value of n1 to this
temporary variable t
so when n1 gets empty
will pass the value of n2 to n1
now n2 gets free
now we'll pass the value of t temporary
variable to n2
so this is how it is getting swapped
now
we'll print a message
slash and first of all we'll write
slash in
and
after swapping slash and we have used
because of
we want to create some space so that it
looks good
now after swapping
now
will display the variables that is n1
and n2
we will do it the same way
n1
and now the variable n1
and line
so that looks good now
same for n2
and it's done now all we have to do is
run this program
so first of all let's save this program
by control and s
now let's try to run this
here we can see enter two numbers that
you want to swap
so let's write
6
and
8.
so n1 is our six and two is our eight
after swapping n1 becomes eight and n2
becomes six
so our output is correct and the program
is working fine
so now let's do one example of
inheritance
so let's
create a new file
and now
name this file
c plus plus tute5
dot
cpp and let's save this
so as we know that in inheritance there
is a parent child relationship between
two classes
so let's start
first of all let's include the header
file
hash include iostream
now we'll use using name space
standard
now
in this question we'll start with parent
class so let's write class keyword
now let's name the class as parent
itself
all
right now
the access modifier public
and
the function let's say
car
void car
now in this function we will print
access to car
access to cars
all right this is one function let's
create another one
wide
villa
these both are the properties of a
parent class
so
here i'll write
access to
the villa
so these are the two functions in the
class
and make sure to put the semicolon in
the end of the class
now we will create the child class and
we know that the child class inherits
the parent class so it can access the
functions and variables
all right
so let's create this
child class
right class keyword
and name it as child itself
now we'll put colon
and write the parent class
this shows that the
child class is inherited from the base
class that is parent
now
we'll write public access modifier
now write a function
savings
now the savings function is inside the
child class
so
so here we'll
display
access to the savings
and line
now here we'll put the semicolon as the
class is ending
now we'll start with int main
inside int main
will create an object of child class
and will try to access the
functions of the parent class
so let's do this
child
name of the class now the object of
child class
c1
now we'll try to call this
parent class functions that is car and
villa
let's see if the child class has access
to
the functions of parent class that is
car and villa
all right
c1
object name dot
car that is the function name
now
object name dot function name
that is villa
here we are calling these two functions
and after that c1 dot savings
which is the
function of child itself child class
now return
0. now let's see that
if child class can access these two
functions of parent class
let's save it by pressing control and s
at the same time
now let's run this
as you can see access to cars access to
will and access to savings
access to cars access to villa and
access to savings
so this proves that
child class inherits from the parent
class because here we have created the
object of child class and we are calling
the functions of parent class
and
the functions of parent class whatsoever
is written or displayed inside those
functions is getting printed so this
proves that
child class inherits from the parent
class
so this is the example of inheritance
and we have done five to six examples on
different topics
you can try some more examples on these
topics

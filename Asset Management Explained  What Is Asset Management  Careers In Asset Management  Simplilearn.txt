exciting video by simply learn
today we are going to discover the realm
of asset management what it is and what
career advancements it has to offer
if you have a strong interest in the
financial market and want to learn more
about it then we urge you to stay tuned
until the end of this video
let's look at the agenda for this
session
we are going to begin this session with
an introduction to asset management what
it is and how it works after that we'll
tell over details about career
opportunities in the field of asset
management
i think i have made myself clear with
the agenda so without wasting any time
let's get started with the first topic
what is asset management
asset management is about managing
clients investments and providing them
with the strategies and expertise that
would allow them to achieve their goals
and secure their financial future
simply put asset management within the
world of banking and finance is all
about managing and investing large sums
of money on behalf of their client in
order to get a positive return over the
long period of time
in other words asset management is a
financial industry that uses money to
make more money
clients that contact these asset
management firms have large income that
if left alone will depreciate in value
and to refrain that from happening asset
management businesses provide these
clients with expertise across a wide
range of asset classes depending on
their investment portfolio this
investment portfolio is nothing more
than the information and what the
customer expects in the long term how
much risk he is willing to take and so
on
now let's look at the client classes of
these asset management firms the asset
management clientele is segregated into
two parts the first one is individual
client and second one is financial
institution individual clients are
people with huge amount of money whereas
institutional clients are insurance
companies government entities charities
or even corporate pension funds
asset management companies offer
expertise across a wide spectrum of
asset classes such as stocks bonds
commodities real estate private equity
etc moreover these large corporations
have branches all over the world and are
able to offer geographical expertise as
well
since these companies closely follow the
financial market they can offer high
quality advice and superior risk return
investments
initially these firms study client needs
create an actionable investment
portfolio implement the investment
strategy in practice and oversee its
development through the time
the portfolios focus on all segments of
the financial market the research about
the small cap and large cap stocks blue
chip and dividend stocks stocks from
growth regions such as brick countries
there is more to this list of stocks
however all of it depends on the risk
profile of the client the next
investment sector bonds also have
different instances such as short
maturity and long maturity bonds
corporate and government bonds in
addition to that we have commodities
real estate and some other alternative
investment sectors such as hedge funds
or private equity
moving forward we'll discuss how these
asset management firms actually work
we'll discover asset management's
functioning with the help and pension
fund example now you must be wondering
what a pension fund is well consider
pension fund as a large pot in which
employees or private companies put some
amount of their salary to secure their
financial future
this superannuation fund or port
provides for the expenses of employees
once they retire
let's say apple inc has this scheme up
pension fund and since it has huge
employee base the amount of money going
into this pension fund
on a monthly basis will be huge
and since we are dealing with an
enormous amount of money there is a
possibility that things like political
imbalance in a country currency
fluctuation change in countries economic
policies or inflation can impact this
fund and decrease the value of money in
it over a period of time
that is why these funds needs to be
invested into the financial markets to
refrain from loss of economy
and to grow this money even further so
that the employees can rely on this
scheme
in addition to this pension fund example
the clients of asset management firms
include insurance companies who also
have a lot of money let's say you have
bought yourself bike insurance and you
pay a premium on a yearly basis for the
same
however you don't actually utilize the
insurance claim throughout the year you
only take insurance to mitigate risk if
any accident happens in the future
so consider thousands of people doing
the same thing as you
the premiums these insurance companies
going to receive is going to be quite
substantial right
so these companies will have to invest
this capital to generate more money and
mitigate any significant future risk
events or catastrophes if they show up
another large institutional customer of
these asset management firms are
sovereign wealth funds and non-profit
charitable organizations sovereign
wealth funds are basically large pools
of money owned by governments charities
can also have large pools of money lying
around because they don't know what to
do with it at the present moment or they
might be thinking that it's not the best
time to invest it into charity because
because of some reasons and hence that
huge money might be sitting idle so
rather than keeping it idle they invest
it into financial markets with the help
of an asset management firms
having said that let's discover the job
opportunities you can get in this asset
management industry there is a wide
range of job roles within an asset
management organization however there
are three main profiles around which the
whole asset management revolves
the first one is sales
the sales post is responsible for
establishing clients relationships and
understanding clients needs these are
the people who will actually bring
clients to the firm and will also create
investment profiles
next we have is research team the
research team comprise a professional
research analyst help investment team
locate best financial plans available in
the market which have a tendency to grow
over a period of time
finally we have portfolio management the
portfolio managers are the people who
are ultimately responsible for making
investment decisions also these people
create and manage client portfolios
according to their needs mentioned by
sales team
they also make sure that the assets are
on the path of growth
according to glassdoor the average
annual salary for an asset management
professional ranges between dollars 71
000 to 132 000 in u.s whereas it lies in
between
7.2 lpa to 35 lpa in india the top asset
management companies across the world

million dollars worth of assets
talking about work-life balance asset
management has more flexible hours than
most investment banking and consulting
job roles people do work hard but 16
hours of work shift

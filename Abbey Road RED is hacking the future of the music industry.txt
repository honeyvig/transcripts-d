>> Welcome to the very first
Abbey Road Hackathon.
>> We're trying to look
at nascent technologies,
the cognitive APIs which
we're using in partnership
with Microsoft,
for example, to put down
a bridge into the future
of music technology.
>> Hackathon is all about
a creative environment that
allows people to come up
with brand new ideas,
things that we've never seen before.
>> The amount of innovation history
that is in this building
that we're surrounded by,
is astounding to the point
of overwhelming.
>> You're looking at
music tech history,
the patenting of stereo,
the creation of the Red 17.
It was the first recording
studios complex.
>> We are building
the Microsoft Vision API.
It takes emotions of
people's faces and then
generates music recommendations
based on their emotion.
>> The ideas that someone
was going to rap,
the algorithm is going
to understand it and
it's going to rap back a punchline.
>> So, we use the 3D
from Microsoft API.
We got them really into the flow
of what we wanted to do.
>> Sometime around midnight,
two O'clock, they just
have to go to sleep.
So, they'll pass out on a beanbag,
short nap, get back up and start
the process all over again.
>> Hey, guys [inaudible]
>> We are all turned up,
here's the facial
recognition software
capturing the mood of the crowd.
>> We hope you enjoy our products.
>> Now, I have the pleasure
to present record to you.
We'll use the Microsoft API
to understand the speech.
It was trained to generate
appropriate response.
>> Impress with some rhymes.
>> My homies' in
Abbey Road. Check it out.
>> We are really glad to
present to you, LYRA.
With LYRA, you just input a word,
to be viewed a LYRA suggestion.
>> The price goes to.
>> Team Rocket.
>> Can we do it tomorrow again?

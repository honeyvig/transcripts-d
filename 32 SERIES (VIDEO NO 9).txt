hello everyone today we are going to see
32 important points of oral microbiology
point number one the metabolic acids
produced by mutant streptococci
demineralized the tooth surface on later
dental caries point number two the major
cariogenic property of streptococcus
mutans appears to be its ability to
produce the in glucose will transferase
point number three along with
streptococcus mutans streptococcus
anguish salivary as' and lactobacillus
species also produce glucose l
transferase member for actin ah -
viscose s and s lindakhaas root surface
caries point number five at no bacillus
species are gram-negative Coco buzz
Larry rods point number six properties
of streptococci essential for caries
formation are they are there to tooth
surface and colonized they produce
lactic acid which dissolve the enamel of
the tooth and they produce a polymeric
substance which causes the acid to
remain contact with the tooth point
number seven
streptococcus anguish and septic occurs
Midas produced hydrogen peroxide number
eight streptococcus mutans sees as a
Jurek and produces lactic acid number
nine streptococcus ala various is found
consistently in saliva and an oral soft
tissue
number ten streptococci are Grampa's
choco-pie that are facultative anaerobes
under the most numerous group of
bacteria in the oral cavity
number eleven the organic constituents
of plaque include polysaccharides like
dextran proteins glycoproteins and lipid
material point number twelve the
inorganic components of block are
predominantly calcium and phosphorus
with trace amounts of other materials
including sodium potassium and fluoride
number 13 the source of inner conic
constraints of sucrose gingival placas
primarily saliva number 14 the dominant
WBC noted in the inflammatory infiltrate
of energy's
neutrophil now let's study about block
formation point number 15 on day one and
two in claw consists primarily of coke I
from second day to fourth day coca still
dominate but there are increasing number
of filamentous forms and slender rods
gradually the filamentous forms replace
many of the coca from this four to seven
filaments increase in number and a more
mixed flora begins to appear with rods
filamentous forms and fuse of bacteria
point number 18 from day 7 to 14 with
Rios and spirochetes appear and the
number of WBC increases the science of
inflammation begin to appear image in
Java point number 19 from this 14 to 21
with Rios and spirochetes are prevalent
in older block along with filamentous
forms gingivitis is evident clinically
number 20 as block increases the number
of Kukai decreases and the number of
rods filaments on spirochetes gates
increases the number of aerobic bacteria
decreases and the number of anaerobic
bacteria gets increases and also the
number of gram positive organisms
decreases and the number of gram
negative will increase number 21 the
bacterias are predominant in mature
clock are anaerobic and Asakura I take
and use amino acids and small peptides
as energy sources number 22 as clock
matures
there is a shift from a predominance of
facultative Grampa's to bacteria to
gram-negative in aerobic bacteria
point number 23 in cervical o'clock they
do associated with gram posture Autzen
foci and tissue associated with
gram-negative rods and cocci filaments
flagellated rods and spirochetes point
number 24 in deeper parts of pocket
tooth is associated with gram-negative
rods and tissue gets associated with
gram-negative rods coca flagellated rots
and spirochetes point number 25 the
apical part of tooth dominated by
spirochetes coca and rots
whereas in coronal
more filaments are observed number26
saliva is the source of mineralization
first Supra general colliculus whereas
the serum translate called GCF furnishes
the minerals for sub gingival calculus
poly number 27 an egg is a condition
which represents rather patent ohmic
characteristic of single disease
clinical signs and symptoms point number
28 important clinical signs are
interproximal necrosis and pseudo
membrane formation on marginal tissues
history of soreness and bleeding gums
caused by eating and brushing point
number 29 other signs and symptoms
include a sweet aurorus a low-grade
fever inferred no potty and malice
number 30 anak most commonly occurs in
adults between the ages of eighteen to
thirty number 31 factors which seem to
predispose someone to an ER include a
history of gingivitis tobacco smoking
grass necklace Friday and stress number
32 the following bacteria are associated
with Anna
they are intermediate sized spirochetes
prevotella intermedia fuse or bacterium
species and Salmonella species that's it

hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in today's session we
will be talking some of the important
topics in seashop that is c sharp loops
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
in this session we will be introducing
you to the c-sharp loops then we will go
over all the different loops in c sharp
with detailed explanations and code
examples
so i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with
introduction to c-sharp loops
programming frequently necessitates the
repeated execution of a sequence of
operations a loop is a basic programming
construct that allows the execution of a
piece of software code to be repeated
depending on the loop's type its code is
repeated a set of number of times or
until a certain time is reached the
condition is correct
next we will look at the various types
of loops in c sharp
first we will look at while loop then we
will have do while loop after that we
have follow following that we have for
each loop in c sharp then we have nested
loops after that then break and continue
and finally we will have switch
statements in c sharp
we will look at these different types of
c sharp loops in depth including an
introduction syntax flowchart diagram
and code example first we will look at
the while loop while the condition is
any expression that returns a boolean
result true or false and one is the
simplest and most used loops is known as
the loop condition because it determines
how long the loop body will be repeated
the loop body in this example is the
programming code executed at each
iteration of the loop that is whenever
the input is true here is the syntax of
a while loop we have the keyword while
we have the condition we have the code
body inside the brackets
the while loop flow diagram is shown
below now let's look at how a while loop
works
in the while loop the boolean expression
is first calculated and if it's true the
sequence of operations in the loop body
are executed the input condition is then
checked again and if it's true the loop
body is executed once more all of this
is repeated until the conditional
expression returns false at some point
at this point the loop is terminated and
the program proceeds to the next line
immediately following the loop's body
if the cycle condition returns false at
start the body of the while loop may not
be executed even once if the cycle's
condition is never broken the loop will
continue indefinitely
let's look at a simple example of why
loop in action the loop's purpose is to
print the numbers 1 through 15 in
ascending order on the console
let's put the program to test and see
how it performs
in this program we have a constructor
variable called i and we initialize it
to 1 and execute the loop body while the
loop condition is true after that we run
our while loop up to 15 times and then
we print that counter variable and
increment by 1 at the same time now
let's quickly execute the program and
say the output
there you go the program got
successfully executed and you can see
the output right on my screen
next we will look at the do while loop
and try to understand it
the do while loop is like a while loop
but it checks the condition after each
loop body execution
this loop type is also known as loop
with the condition at the end or post
test loop
a do while loop appears as follows here
is the syntax
in the do while syntax we have the
keyword do first then the code body to
execute and finally the condition
following the while keyword
here is the flow diagram of do while
loop let us see how do while flow
diagram works
the loop body is executed first and its
condition is evaluated later if it is
true the loop's body is repeated
otherwise it is terminated this logic is
repeated until the loop's condition is
broken
the loop's body is executed at least
once if the loop's condition is always
true the loop will never end
let's look at an example of do while
loop
in this example we will calculate the
factorial of given number x again but
instead of an infinite while loop we
will use a do while loop
let's put this program to test and see
how it performs
in this program we have a number x we
have to find the factorial of this
number we initialize the factorial
number as 1 and then a loop to perform
the factorial of the given number and
decrease the number by 1 simultaneously
after we have determined the variable x
must be greater than 0 we will compare
the factorial to the given number of the
value x
now let's execute this program and say
the output there you go the program got
successfully executed and now it is
asking for the value of x let us provide
5 instead of 1.
the factorial of 5 is 120 so that's how
the factorial and the do-while loop
executes
now let's look at the next type of loop
the next type of loop is the for loop
while the functionality of a for loop is
like that of a while loop the syntax is
a little different when loop statements
are to be executed are known ahead of
the time for loops are preferred the
loop variable initialization condition
to be tested and increment or decrement
of the loop variable are all done in one
line in the for loop resulting in a
shorter easier to debug looping
structure
the following is the scheme that
describes for loops the syntax is given
below in this loop syntax we have the
loop initialization test condition
increment or decrement and statements to
be executed
let's go over the syntax of for loops
the variable controlling the loop is
initialized here which defines variable
loop execution it's the starting point
of a for loop a previously declared
variable can be used or a new variable
that is only local to the loop can be
declared and then we have a testing loop
the testing condition asserts the
circumstance in which loop statements
are executed it is used to test the exit
condition of the loop it must either
return true or false when the condition
is false the control is removed from the
loop and program is terminated and
finally we have increments or decrements
as well as the loop variable is
incremented or decremented as needed and
the control is returned to the testing
condition let us look at how the flow
diagram of for loop works
first the initialization statement is
executed typically the variable is
declared and initialized here this
variable is a count of lag because it
controls the number of iterations the
for loop will perform
the following steps in evaluating the
for condition the condition is a boolean
expression which returns true or false
the statements or programs within the
for loop are executed if the condition
is true these iterations are repeated
until the condition is determined to be
false when the condition evaluates to be
false the flow shifts from the inside to
the outside of the loop
let's look at the example let's look at
an example we will write a program that
raises the number a to power of b and we
will use a for loop to accomplish this
in this example we have two variables a
and b with a base number and b as
exponent next we ask the user to enter
the value for a and b and we run the
loop for 0 to exponent b then we perform
how can we calculate the power of a rise
to b and finally we will display the
power of given numbers
let's execute the program and see the
output
there you go the program was
successfully executed now it's asking to
enter a number let's enter 2
let's enter another number that is power
let's enter it as 2 to the power 3 there
you go the answer is 8
that's how the for loop works
now following that we have for each loop
let's try to figure out what is for each
loop
for each loop and c sharp iterates
through a collection of items an array
or a list when each loop is executed it
executes a block of code on a collection
of items passing through the items in
the collection and finally displaying
them one by one the syntax for for each
loop is as follows we have the for each
keyword then we have
type of variable in collection then we
have a code for execution that resides
inside the braces
the flow diagram of forage loop is shown
below let's look at how the flow diagram
of for each loop works the forage loop
iterates through the elements in a
collection when using a for each loop it
is mandatory to enclose statements in
curly places
when declaring a lower counter variable
we can use same type of as array based
type
let's look at an example for for each
loop
in this example we create an array of
numbers which is then looped through and
elements are printed on the console then
the array of town names strings is
created and proceeds in the same way
with elements printed in the console as
a result of the example let's get back
to the practical mode and execute a
practical one in this program we have an
array as the number we have numbered as
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 and 16 then we have for
each loop while we run for an array of
numbers with counter variable i then we
have the town name as london paris usa
and new york again we have for each loop
we have while for running town names and
finally we will print both arrays and
string let's quickly execute the program
and see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and we have our
outputs on our screens
following that we have our next c sharp
loop that is nested loop let's try and
understand nested loops in c sharp
nested loops are programming constructs
made up of several nested loops within
each other the innermost loop is
executed more frequently while the auto
most is executed less frequently let's
look at two nested loops the syntax of a
nested for loop is same as that of a for
loop with two for loops with the same
variable initialization testing
condition and increment or decrement
here is the flow diagram of nested for
loops and we will now see how it works
following the initialization of first
follow the execution of its body which
contains the second nested loop we will
begin
its variable will be initialized its
condition will be checked and the code
execution within the body is executed
following by the variable being updated
and execution containing until the
condition is false following that the
second iteration of the first for loop
will continue its variable will be
updated and the entire second loop will
be repeated the inner loop will be
executed as many times as the outer loop
body is true here is an example of
printing the triangle shape of a given
number x to triangle with x lines on the
console app using for each loop
now let's get back to the practical mode
in this program we attempted to create a
right angle triangle with an asterisk
and height of five we have value five
because we will make a triangle
up to five we have two variables that
will handle row and column and finally
we will have k for height so the first
for loop is running for row and the
second for loop is running for column
then we have another loop that will run
up to five that is the height of the
triangle finally we will print the hash
trick to create a right angle shaped
triangle
now let's quickly execute the program
and see the output
so there you go we have a right angle
triangle made up of hash tricks
after the nested loop we have the
continue and break statements we will
see what the continued statement is
continue as one of many conditional
statements in c programming language
that can be used inside a conditional
loop block to function as a clause to
continue the loop execution after the
iterative condition is executed to move
on to the next execution of the next
iteration in the conditional loop it is
commonly used with iterative conditional
loops such as four while loop or do
while loop and for each loop let's look
at the flow diagram of the continue
statement and to see how it works
when the loop begins if there is a
continue statement it will stop at the
current iteration and pass control to
the next iteration by returning to the
loop beginning we will look at
using the continue operator in the
following example using the for loop we
will compute the sum of all odd integers
in the range 1 to x that is not
divisible by 9.
now let's execute the example for
continue followed by that we will go
ahead with break
so there you go the program has executed
and you have the output on my screen now
let's continue with the break
first we set the variable of loop to 1
because it is the first odd integer in
the range 1 to x after each loop
iteration we check to see if we have yet
exceeded n i is equals to x
in the expression for updating the
variable we multiply it by 2 to ensure
that it only passes through odd numbers
we check whether the current number is
divisible by 9 within the loop body
if this is the case we use the continue
operator which escapes the rest of the
loop's body adding the current number to
the sum if the number is not divisible
by 9 the sum is updated to the current
number after that we will have a break
statement let's go over what it is the
break statement is used at the end of
the for loop and that is present in if
it is present the control will be passed
to the statements that flow the big
statement if the break statement is
present in the nested loop it only
terminates the loop that contains the
break statement the syntax is as follows
it is very simple because we only need
to write break keyword following that we
have the flow diagram of the break
keyword and we will try to understand
how it works it checks for the specific
condition at the start of the flow if it
is satisfied the loop is continued at
the point where the loop gets break
statement or the condition where it gets
out of the loop with break statement
let's see an example of using break
statement first we initialize the
variable factorial with 1 and rate x
from the console we construct an endless
while loop by using true as condition of
the loop we use the break operator to
terminate the loop when x reaches a
value less than or equal to 1. otherwise
we multiply the current result by x and
reduce x with one unit practically the
first iteration of the loop the variable
factorial has a value n in the second
that is x into x minus 1 and so on in
the last iteration of the loop the
factorial value is the product of x into
x minus 1 into x minus 2 and so on which
is the desired result of factorial x
let's quickly execute the program and
see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and we have 5 into
4 into 3 into 1 which is equals to 120.
finally we have the switch statement the
switch statement in c sharp is a
multi-wave branch statement it provides
an efficient method for transferring
execution to different parts of a code
based on the expression value the switch
expression is an integer type end care
byte short enumeration or string type
the expression is checked for various
causes and only one which matches is
executed here the syntax of switch
statement where the switch keyword
follows an expression then we have
different cases starting with case 1 and
go on up to case n then we have break
keyword and finally with the default
case which generally has default set of
sequences here in this statement flow
diagram and let us try to understand how
it works
with a switch statement and expression
is passed equally to one of the case
values if the value is not equal the
default case is used this expression
value is then compared to the case
identifier or the first case if the
first case matches the code associated
with that case is executed when you
reach break the execution will halt and
exit the switch statement if the case
does not match the execution moves on to
the next case if the case matches the
second code block is executed otherwise
the flow proceeds to the next case in
the same manner finally the default code
block is executed if no case matches
let's see an example of switch case the
user is asked to enter an alphabet in
this example if the alphabet is in
uppercase it is converted to lowercase
using the to lower method now we are on
the practical mode and that's the code
on my screen the switch statement checks
to see if the alphabet entered by you as
any of the given that is a eiou
if you have the cases matched then the
given character is a vowel then it is
printed as output otherwise the control
returns the default block and the given
character is not available and that
message will be printed on your screen
now let's quickly execute the statement
and see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed now let's enter
a e i o u any of the one of those so
i'll enter a
and there you go the given character is
a vocal and if i had entered any other
than eiou the
default message would have been printed
that is the alphabet entered is not
available now that's how the switch
statement works with that we have

- So a lot of corporate leadership coaches
ask this question.
I'd like to get your feedback on it.
- Oh, yeah?
- If you had to pick you
know, one Golden Girl
which one would you be?
- Rue McClanahan, she was the sassy one.
- Uh huh, that would be you.
- That'd be me.
- It's lunchtime, and this is
Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Whenever I can I try to take advantage
of both of these things and I grab lunch
with some of the tech
industry's best and brightest.
(upbeat peppy music)
Okay, so let's have a little fun.
You and I can play this
game called This or That.
- [Nicole] Okay, fantastic.
- [Brad] Epic.
- I said fantastic.
This could go off the rails.
- Oh, this is fine.
So I'm gonna give you like two topics,
and then I'll give you some
kind of word or description.
You're gonna tell me is
it one, two, or both.
- Okay.
- Okay?
So your two terms are
transatlantic flights.
- Okay.
- Or World of Warcraft.
Okay, do you know much
about World of Warcraft?
- A little bit.
- [Brad] Alright.
- I had to stop playing so that I could
finish writing my
dissertation, yes. (laughing)
- Okay, alright, here we go.
You would do something unspeakable
in an exchange for an upgrade.
- Transatlantic flight.
- Okay, I think my boys would say both.
You have too much personal baggage
to be able to sit comfortably.
(laughing)
- Um, World of Warcraft.
- Walking the floor at a tech conference.
- Yes?
- Or joining a fight club.
People get more aggressive
the longer they're there.
- [Tim] I guess the fight club.
- Yeah, I don't know.
That could be both.
I've seen people at the
tech conference before.
- It could be both.
Yeah, it could be both.
- There ya go, okay.
You go back home and brag about
how many sessions you were in.
- [Tim] That could be both.
- Yeah, so a big part
of the work that you do
is really deepening and broadening
the partnerships that Microsoft has.
- Right.
- And so, you know, there will be a lot
of CIOs and senior leaders
who will be watching
you know, what we're talking about here.
How does the work that
you do impact their lives
and make them better and
their organizations better?
- [Peggy] I think we've had more of a focus
over the last several years
on the partnership aspect
and kind of moving from this
transactional relationship
to more of a strategic
partnership relationship,
and that's opened up a lot of
doors for us and our partners.
And rather than, you know,
approaching it from a transaction
we can say, you know, what
do our joint customers need?
What problems are they trying to solve?
And then that helps us look at areas
of collaboration that
we can do with partners,
and I think the opportunities
for both sides have increased.
- [Brad] Totally.
- Yeah, we take a lot of the
friction out of it for them
so if they have to do something manually
that sort of integrates our two products
our partner's and our own and we can
put them together in a seamless fashion.
Um, that's sort of a
win for all three of us.
- So over the years you've interviewed
a ton of like, the tech heavy stars.
- Yeah.
- Right?
- Yes.
- Any one of them leave you totally
like wow that was amazing?
- [Tim] I did interview Steve Ballmer.
- Yeah.
- Um, so that was quite
fun, and his character
was not quite what I expected
when I first met him.
He was uh--
- Lot more low key in an interview?
- Yeah, I guess so, yes.
Yes, and I liked him actually.
I think he was full of life
and full of enthusiasm.
I really appreciated that.
- Yeah, well people know Steve for kind of
like the stage presence, but when you're
in a small group you know, and you just
have this conversation,
he really is a great--
- Yeah, and very sharp.
- Exactly, just a great guy.
I always loved those times I got to
spend with Steve like that.
We talk a lot about this
transition to the cloud
and the culture change that
it is for our customers.
We've had to go through that internally.
You know, I've gotten hundreds
and hundreds of engineers
who have built on prem
products for, you know,
for some of them for decades.
Now some of that skill set
is implacable in the cloud,
but we've had to fundamentally relearn
different aspects of what it means
to build cloud services, to operate them,
you know, the architecture is different
than a client server architecture.
So we've had to go through that same
cultural transition
internally that many customers
right now are facing as we're helping them
and pushing them to move to the cloud,
but we've had to go through it first.
- [Jeff] I have started, and I think
people would be surprised
about this from the SharePoint guy,
I start when I'm sitting down with the CIO
or I'm on my phone, let me show you how.
Look, here's, you know, see all my email,
my calendar, but wait, it gets better.
Here's OneDrive bring up all my docs.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Here's how I share things.
You know, let's keep going.
Let me show you the new SharePoint app
where I can show you my intranet,
and I can show you my collab
sites and the publishing sites,
and search on people and documents
and that blows people's mind.
They say wow if I could deliver all that
just to our users they'd be great.
And they say on top of that it is secure.
- [Ben] This stuff isn't really
a technology barrier.
This isn't really a technology change
It's a cultural change.
It's a huge change.
- Massive culture change.
- And you know, if we talk about tools
or if we talk about technology first
without actually addressing the fact
that this about people, because we hear
every company has their
Uber moment coming.
It's actually about how do
you think about your business
in terms of what your customers want
and will want into the future
and what your people can
fundamentally deliver.
So it's really about that human element
and just spending time kind of thinking
about the future and your future.

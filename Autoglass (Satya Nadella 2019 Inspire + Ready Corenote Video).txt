>> My name is Martin Lee,
I work for Autoglass.
I've been with the company
for about five years.
So when I first started at Autoglass,
I started as a dispatcher.
I did the reporting side of it.
I'd do all these reports every day,
and it's just time consuming and
that was making most of my day.
I thought if I can shorten my time,
I can get on with other things.
That's where PowerApps come in.
So I started looking into it.
I thought, "Oh, yeah,
it's quite easy."
I was actually started
to build an app and it
was actually really great.
I built an app called
Technician Weekly Vehicle Check.
A technician used to have to fill
a form and take a picture of it,
send it to his Operations Manager.
He'd have to put it on
an Excel spreadsheet
and it was just a long process.
Now, that's just put it in
an app. Technicians love it.
It just literally
save their time from
half an hour per job to 10 minutes,
saving us $1.6 million a
year in potential revenue.
I felt excited.
Everyone's using this app I
created, and I'm like, "Oh, wow.
I've done that." People just
kept coming to me to
build these apps.
Now, I'm going into IT,
which is a different role.
This is amazing where
my career has gone now.
I've built about 40 apps now
deployed in the company.
The apps are working so
well here in the UK.
Safelite now wants to deploy
our Technical Helpdesk in the USA.
Just the thought of
my apps being used
around the world gives
me such a proud feeling.

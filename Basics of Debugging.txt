[Music]
hey everyone welcome to another episode
of Visual Studio toolbox I'm your host
Leslie Richardson and today I'm excited
because we're talking about one of my
favorite topics good old debugging you
know the the topic that everyone dreads
but we're all having to do as developers
but uh yeah we're going to start from
square one today talking to all about
how to get started debugging for the
first time in visual studio and joining
me to do that today is Nick
hey Nick hi Leslie nice to see you nice
to see you too so before we uh jump into
debugging do you want to tell us a
little bit about
yourself yeah sure so um my name is Nick
I'm a software developer from the UK uh
near Manchester uh I'm currently working
as a director of software engineering
for a uh robotic process automation
company we use a lot of net in our stack
um and yeah just excited to talk about
uh debu B okay awesome I'm excited too I
used to work on the visual studio
debugger so yeah debugging is near and
dear to my
heart yeah definitely yeah so for those
who don't know what that is or maybe are
getting started in their coding Journey
what is debugging and why are we stuck
doing
it yeah yeah so unfortunately like it
will be like a really common practice
for you you know so many times people
say what you working on I'm just
debugging this I'm bugging that um and
it's it's kind of quite a negative
connotation to it but it's actually it's
essential and um it the the simplest way
I could describe it is you're tracking
down that pesky buug you know you're
trying to find the root cause of a
behavior that's um happening that's
unexpected uh and so using visual studio
we can um rather than let the code just
run through in its normal State we can
actually pause the code and inspect it
to see what the current state is and how
that might be contributing to the issue
that you
see awesome yeah I think that's a great
definition so yeah should we hop into
visual studio and see how to get started
yeah let's go for
[Music]
it so I've just created uh a typical
console application so whenever I do a
demo I find it really easy to just build
a a normal C console application with a
main method uh and then to to jump right
into it and so the first thing that I
want to talk about is um the compilation
modes that you can see in visual studio
uh so you've probably seen already that
you've got this debug drop down and you
get the debug or release options in
there and now for the purposes of what
we're doing we obviously want to be in
debug but it's not obvious what the
reason for that is um so there's
different modes of compilation for uh
for C in particular um in visual studio
and the difference being that when
you're in debug mode which will be your
um default mode there's a there's a
little bit of a difference in terms of
the way things are compiled we have
things called symbols uh that allow the
application will allow Visual Studio to
know where you are in the code uh and
it's less optimized it's quite I mean as
you know Leslie it's quite a complicated
subject I won't go too deep on that but
just so you're aware of its existence
the default mode will be debug uh and
then on the flip side of that release
mode is it's kind of the opposite of
that there's less optimiz there's sorry
more optimization uh you don't have
those symbols uh that are telling you
where you are in the code simply because
you aren't expected to be debugging in
release mode uh so so that's the
difference between the
two um and the reason I talk about this
is because one of the uh debugging
aspects that you can take advantage of
in Visual Studio is something called uh
pre-processor directives uh so these are
the lines you see here where we've got
this little hashtag symbol um and this
is where you're adding a condition into
the way the application is being
compiled so it's not the same as like a
conventional if statement uh it's
something that sort of sits outside of
the code it's more for visual studios's
benefit uh so for here for example we're
simply saying that if the current mode
is debug then we want to execute some
spefic specific code uh otherwise it's
going to be in release mode and we can
execute this code so I can demonstrate
that and it will also demonstrate a
break point so we're kind of killing two
birds with one stone there
hopefully
great so I'm currently in debug so I
would expect to uh put a breakpoint in
here um a breakpoint is what we were
saying before about pausing your code it
say um it's a point in the code where
you can say I don't want you to run
further than this point I want you to
stop at that point so I can take a look
around and see what's happening in the
application now obviously if your
breakpoint is inside an if statement and
that if statement uh doesn't evaluate to
true you won't hit your breakpoint so
we're kind of testing the if debug
scenario by saying we're expecting this
to hit that break point because we're in
debug
Y and so in Visual Studio to kick the
program off uh and start debugging we
can go to the top here and click the
play
button and let the application fire up
and then as you can see we've hit our
break point and as we said the reason
we've hit that is because we're saying
only go to that break point sorry only
write out this line to the console if
we're in debug and we are and we've also
put a break point there so we're now
paused
great pretty simple also I gotta say
shout out to the debugger team for uh
make for adding the ability to see that
you can actually add a breakpoint in the
first place by hovering over the gutter
where you just added that break point
that used to not exist and I can imagine
if you're like brand new because a lot
of schools and a lot of uh classes that
you take don't always teach debugging so
if you're just trying to figure this out
on your own it's like not very intuitive
maybe to to know that oh a breakpoint is
here so yeah yeah absolutely Echo that
and you know you guys uh if you're
picking up visual studio for the first
time you know you got kind of spoiled to
be honest the featur feature sets
amazing I was writing uh VB6 in the old
Visual Basic and it was a fantastic tool
but it's come so far the debugging
experience has since then so oh yeah
yeah it's super
powerful uh and obviously if um we want
to test our theory around um whether the
release uh breakpoint would hit we can
add another break point here uh and then
change the mode over to release so now
this pre-process cessor uh for if debug
it should evaluate to false so we
shouldn't see it hit that break point so
I'll just click play there and there we
go we've hit the other break point
instead because we're now in release
mode so you can see the way that break
points can be affected by the position
you you put them in if they're inside
some logic which wouldn't normally be
hit in the code you can guarantee the
break point won't be hit
either Okay so we've talked a lot about
break point
um so along this part of Visual Studio
you can tap those in and they'll uh
appear and disappear um you can also um
this quite a handy function that you can
use in the debug um part of the ribbon
where you can say I just want to turn
off my break points I don't want to
delete them uh but I just want to
disable them and I find that quite
useful if I've been uh debugging
something um for a specific change
because there's a common um misconcep
ception around debugging in my opinion
that it's always to do with bugs it's
actually sometimes around testing as
well you've got a a feature that you're
adding you want to make sure that the
codes running the way you want it to um
and I find that using break points for
that is a fantastic way to to verify
what I'm doing and so when I've made
that change I want to see that it
carries on through without um me
stopping it all the time so being able
to disable things in one place and then
reenable them is really really
useful
so I want to talk about uh steps so
there's lots of different ways uh you
can perform these steps and steps for me
um essentially are ways that you can
move around uh the code once you've
break pointed so once you paused the
execution of your overall application
you've got lots of different options you
can either step into something you can
step over something and you can step out
of something
when I say step into something it has to
be something that you're capable of
stepping into so if it's a variable if
it's just a uh a variable like this
where we're specifying or defining an
integer um you're not going to be able
to step into that because there's
nothing inside to uh step into as far as
debugging goes but for a method or a
function you've got code inside that so
you can choose to either step over it
and Skip uh going through every single
bit of code inside that method or you
can step into it but don't forget that
the code inside it if you go over it it
will still run it will it's not saying
we're not going to run this code we're
just not going to follow it through for
the purposes of
debugging so I've got a method here
called step into method and if I go to
the definition of that everything I'm
doing here is really super simple I'm
just writing things out to the console
uh but if I'm debugging I can choose
whether I want to see uh the code go
into this method or if I want to just
step over it so I'm going to set a
breakpoint here and then I'm going to
run the application and let it just
breakpoint onto that method and then up
on the top left here are your step
actions uh and as you get really good at
debugging um and it becomes second
nature I'm sure Leslie this is you
you're just tapping the key combination
F10 F10 F10 f11 step in it just becomes
like muscle memory right it's just it's
amazing how quickly that can just become
uh done without thinking oh yeah and
plus I mean again you're probably gonna
be de debugging a lot in your coding
career coding Journey so yeah you're
probably gonna learn those keyboard
shortcuts very quickly as somebody who
does not usually remember keyboard
shortcuts f 10 F 11 yeah yeah because I
was thinking about the um disable all
break points and delete all break points
all that sort of stuff and I was like
what is the
keyboard
but yeah stepping in stepping around is
that is like just one tap it's and it's
sometimes you can go a little bit too
fast as well I can just step through
things and go oh I've gone past it and
yeah luckily there are additional
Advanced debugging Tools in VSS that can
help you backtrack if you do that but we
won't get into it that's thinking of
everything
[Laughter]
great so for this one um I want to step
into it so I want to actually go in and
see the code that's going to execute so
um I'm going to hit this step into
button or I can press
f11 and you can see we've actually gone
into that method and then we can do the
same thing for the lines of code that
are inside the method so you may have a
method within a method and so you step
into the first method and then you
decide actually I want to look inside
that method as well or you might think
no I I know that one's good I've tested
that one I'm going to step over it in
which case you can just do the step over
here so you can see these arrows handy
little arrows that just explain uh what
kind of Step we're doing and there you
go we've come out of that now because it
was the last line of code for that
method and we're on to our next
one so I I'm sure you can guess what I'm
going to do next for step over method uh
I'm going to decide that I don't want to
look inside this so I'm just going to
click step over and the last one is one
that I I think a lot of developers in my
opinion I don't know what what you think
Leslie but they potentially use the
least
yeah yeah it scared me a little bit when
I first uh when I first got into into
code because I was I wasn't sure where
it was going to go even though now it's
more obvious to me with experience but
um I don't know I think there's a
tendency to rather than stepping out
once you've decided that your code is
good
um that I you just keep going through is
that the same for you yeah I kind of
feel the same way I I Rely you step out
and Par because I get worried I'm like I
mean I think I'm pretty sure I know
where it's gonna go but let's just go
through the rest of this method anyway
exactly it's just safer to keep
going yeah that 2% un uncertainty is
like yeah but that's really interesting
because it it shows that there's people
have their own debugging habits there's
different debugging Styles and um you
will get that person who will be stepp
to everything and that's fine you know
that's absolutely fine uh because if
that's going to give you the the
information you need that's that's the
way but just to explain step out
essentially it's whichever um method or
function you stepped into uh by pressing
step out you can essentially go back up
into the um the next uh level up
basically so like with um if I look at
at step
into so another handy thing you can do
just press the method and then press F12
and you can go to its definition we
stepped into this but say this had a a
long um block of code and we got halfway
down um and thought you know I'm I'm
okay I don't need to look at this
anymore you can press step out and it
would go back up to the point you were
in the next level up uh obviously not me
and Leslie because we want to play it
safe yeah but it's cool something I do
want to point out is that um breakpoints
and the stepping tools those are pretty
commonplace in the IDE world so yeah if
for whatever reason you're deciding to
use something other than visual cudio
whether that's vs code or uh another IDE
or Advanced editor experience like BS
code those tools will at the very least
be there in some Capac capacity so
you'll always have break points you'll
always have ways to step through to see
what you want to see yeah and in the in
the browser as well that's a that's one
that a lot of um I find that a lot of
developers that I I bring in who are
fairly new um they're less exposed to
the browser debugging experience but the
concept is the same essentially a lot of
the same tools
too cool right this is one of my
favorite features because it helps
is so good it helps you to debug very
very specific uh edge cases you might be
trying to figure out what would be
causing a bug but you know that it's
only in a very specific situation and
this is the conditional breakpoints um
and this is a breakpoint where it starts
off as a normal breakpoint um but then
once you've created it you can then
specify that it is conditional so I'm
just going to get rid of this one here
and I'm going to put a a conditional
break point inside this for Loop uh so
this is a loop where we're going to be
iterating until we've reached uh our top
index and inside the body of this loop
we're going to be multiplying a variable
by two um but what I want to do is say I
don't want to be hitting this breake
point for every single iteration I only
want to hit the breake point if a
certain condition is
true uh and that condition for me could
be
uh that the variable condition demo
value is greater than five because for
some reason I've got a theory that
something breaks when it gets to that
that value
essentially so the way we can do this is
once you've already set your uh break
point you can hover over it and you'll
see there's a settings button uh and if
you click that settings button you get
some uh really cool features that you
can uh take advantage of so in here we
want to first look at conditions so I
can check this conditions
box and it will give you lots of
different options for the condition but
I think the most common one is going to
be conditional expression so this is a
condition Builder that you can use to
say if this condition is true that's the
only time I expect you to hit the break
point you can also do it based on how
many times it it's already hit that line
of code so that's a similar sort of sort
of deal you could say if this line of
code gets hit x times then stop the flow
of the application I want to debug it um
filter this is one I I don't think I've
ever used it Leslie do you want to share
some insights into this one oh goodness
oh filter I because I barely demo that
one either so um I'm blinking out I feel
like it's a slightly it's it's kind of
like hit count and that it's a slightly
different variation of a conditional
expression last time I I checked except
okay it it looks like it's like um a com
just hit my mic sorry it looks like it's
a combination of conditional Expressions
yeah based on because the debugging team
put a handy example in there so there
you
go pretty great and uh I do want to
point out you can add multiple
conditions if you want so like there is
the add
condition uh yeah the add condition
button right below it where you can add
more than one condition for whatever
reason that is an option as well I think
I need to I think I need to put one in
before I can do that don't I so if I did
I think so
yeah so if I said so it's kind of like a
Boolean expression isn't it so it would
be condition demo value is greater than
five and then press enter and then I
should be able to add another one and
the hit count is two um which it would
be or at least one yeah math is is
failing on me today it's nearly nearly
night time in the
UK but but yeah for this one we're
essentially saying the condition is I
only want you to hit that break point if
my variable condition demo value is
greater than five um so for that uh we
can test that out you can see oh I've
just deleted it that's always
good put that in
again okay Enter and then close there we
go and you can see when you've got a
conditional break point because you'll
have a little cross in the middle of it
uh so from that you'll always be able to
see uh that it's slightly different and
also hovering over it gives you uh the
conditions that you set up as
well uh so I'm going to let this
continue to run so because we're already
breakpoint um the play button says that
we want to gives you the option to
continue um and then you might be
thinking how do we know that it's
actually a above five at this point sure
could it not just be highlighting it uh
on its first iteration and this brings
us to inspecting variables so what we
can do to verify that it is actually
hitting that condition is we can hover
over a variable while we're break
pointed uh and you can see here that it
shows a little tool tip telling you what
the current value of that variable is so
we have indeed met that condition that
variable is 10 so it's greater than five
and it hasn't breakpoint did before that
so our conditional breakpoint was
successful okay so I'm going to stop the
application otherwise we're going to be
constantly shifting down also before you
uh go on as we pivot away from break
points those aren't the only break
points fun fact so the lesson here is to
definitely take a minute to explore the
visual studio debugger because there's
tons of additional break points yeah we
got like Trace points uh which is what
Nick just highlighted there's dependent
break points there's uh function
breakpoints data
breakpoints so many to explore that can
help you be a lot more productive in
your debugging Journey that are worth
checking out absolutely absolutely it's
um it's so important isn't it you know
it's all very well and good being good
at of solving problems through your
design of code but if you don't know how
to use the debugging features you're
going to be a a little bit of a
disadvantage um but um the the sort of
the very there's so many Advanced
features like you said yeah like I can't
speak for every IDE but Visual Studio I
mean the debugger is a lot of what makes
Visual Studio really cool if you take
the the time to check out some of its
more advanced features it's awesome yeah
it it blows my mind because it it's the
team has has built something that's
working on a running application that's
like next level for me um how how do you
interrupt the flow of the comp of the
application I I wouldn't even know where
to
start uh so another really cool feature
um is uh the watch feature and a watch
is essentially where you've got uh a
variable of some sort um and you want to
know while the application is running uh
what its value is so it's the it's
similar to where we hovered over that
variable and said you know what's the
value U but we were only doing it for
that specific point that break point we
were on um but if you're break pointing
something else or you're debugging
something else in the application and
you want to keep one eye on another
value to see if something's changing it
and a watch is often a good shout um so
for example if if I wanted to just keep
an eye on this variable and make sure
that it's definitely just 10 uh while
things are running I can rightclick it
and then I can go over
to I may need to be debugging to
actually see this so I'll just put a
break point on it um there's several
ways of doing it as is always the case
with visual
studio um but if I get
to I'm in release now that's probably
why
there we go so I can actually see it in
this watch window here but I'll just
demonstrate here if you right click
while you're break pointed you can see
there's an add watch uh option if you
just click that it will take you to the
watch screen I already had it in there
by the looks of it so I think I can
rightclick it
and delete Watch there we go um but
essentially that's a screen that gives
you all your watches so it's everything
you've flagged as I want to keep an eye
on that basically uh so we've got the
the the variable name the current value
and its type um now obviously we've set
that to 10 and we're break pointed on it
and this is really uh interesting the
value here is zero which is not the same
as what the value is in the code uh and
the reason for this is that because when
we hit a break point we're on that line
of code but the code hasn't actually
executed yet so we have a watch demo
value but because uh we haven't executed
we haven't initialized it with a value
it's got its default value which is zero
for the integer so if I then step over
this and go to the next line that code
has then executed the variable has been
initialized to its value and we can see
here the value in the watches screen has
also changed so you can see how this
would be really useful if you had other
code which could potentially affect that
variable uh I find this really useful
when I'm iterating through uh lots of
different data structures um I think
recently I had uh a big array of Json
objects and I was going through it U and
there was an external variable that got
set based on a very particular uh field
inside these Json objects uh and I
wanted to see the point at which that
variable changed uh and so I could just
put a watch against that variable run
through the iteration and then I could
see ah okay it changed at that point
that's the bit that's setting it
[Music]
basically okay so immediates um so these
are probably after the sort of usual
break pointing aspects this is probably
one of the things I use the most uh I
don't know whether it's because uh I'm
more of a backend engineer um but uh I
don't know whether that that affects it
or not but essentially immediates are
kind of like um for the web developers
they're kind of like the console in the
browser it's kind of like where you can
interact with the uh the code base while
it's paused uh so by that I mean if I
was to type um a variable which is in
the code that has gone past the
execution point
so say watch demo value we're past that
point now say I type that into here I
get intell sense for that as well
because the compiler knows that it's
part of the uh the code base and I can
say watch demo value press enter if I
want to and it will give me the value of
that um but I can so that is essentially
me interacting with the code base um
while it's in a paused State uh and this
is uh valuable for lots of different
different reasons it allows you to test
different theories uh while the the code
is paused so for example uh if you
haven't got a watch on uh the watch demo
value and you think oh I need to make
sure that that is equal to 10 and um
maybe it's not in view so you can't just
hover over it and see it from there I'm
just trying to find an example of why
you would use this um in such a small
application what you could do is say
watch demo value and then similar to
that conditional expression we used in
the uh conditional break points you can
use a Boolean expression so you can say
watch demo value demo value is equal to
10 and that will return a true or false
so we can see here that's returned true
so it's really useful I use this all the
time when I'm looking to just check in
on something that's still uh available
to me as part of the code it's still in
scope to some point uh but I'm probably
halfway down the screen it's out of view
I don't want to scroll back up to it I
just want to quickly use the immediates
to have more of a console
experience you should also be able to
set the value of things so you can start
to um mess around with the state uh of
the application while you're debugging
it so if I did watch demo value equals 4
it will just return the value that I've
set but then if I hover over it you can
see we've just set that to four so we've
intervened in the state of the
application while it's paused it's so
powerful uh and and that allows you to
test lots of different scenarios uh so
very often you could say uh you might
have an application which is um running
only if an invoice value is over say
$10,000 but the data you've got is all
just below that and you want to try and
test that other scenario well you could
quite easily take a variable like
invoice total and then change it inside
the immediates window to test that um
flow of
code you can also do that from the
variable itself uh in most cases so you
can say change it from here and then if
I go back and type this in again and you
can press up as well just like you can
in the command line to get what you've
recently typed in I can see it's six
because I've just set it from elsewhere
in the code base so it's
again this is where debugging gets a
little bit um it's not just looking for
bugs you might also be using it to
influence uh State
mhm yeah the immediate window is pretty
powerful in its own
right there there are lots of people who
really kind of do all of their debugging
in the immediate window a lot of the
time I I'm personally one of those who
doesn't really use it that much but yeah
again whatever floats your boat there's
lots of options in Visual
Studio yeah yeah I mean if you if you
were looking at say again I'll use the
example of Json or or XML it might be
just too much to look at in the debugger
but there's nothing stopping you from
doing a file. write all text in the
immediate window and just then dumping
all that information into a text file or
or XML or Json file so that you can then
look at it all the same time the
application is still paused just giving
yourself a bit more of a an opportunity
to view it in something like Visual
Studio code for
example so it's just for me it's just
super flexible that's I've got options
all the time when I'm debugging in
visual
studio uh so inspecting variables we'
we've pretty much covered uh that is
where you can just hover over them you
can see as we said this is still zero
until uh we actually execute
it and then we get on to something that
has thrown me before honestly um because
they I feel like they're quite similar I
don't know where you are on this Lesly
gosh I still struggle with it too
sometimes
um honestly I I think in most cases it's
okay to lump autos and locals window
together but if the watch window is like
your inspection window for being a but
you have to manually select which
variables do you want to have persist
and take a look at as you're going
through your code the locals and Autos
Windows automatically give you the
variables that are currently in the
scope of where you're at so if you
swapped over to the locals or AOS window
right now then you'd be getting a lot of
the variables that are both within a
scope or in proximity and I think the
Autos window is really just more
proximity focused more so than so it
takes the nearby variables not
necessarily all the the variables that
are currently relevant so yeah I sorry
Leslie you go no go ahead I was just
gonna say I thought that was a really
good explanation um I I think I looked
for a definition before the show because
I like to be prepared um but you know
Autos it was It was kind of defined as
um a a reference to any code which is
relevant to the current line but that's
a really vague definition isn't it it's
really hard to to make that accessible I
I agree so that is my best
interpretation of it anyway just through
observation but I think at the end of
the day a lot of the time the autos and
locals are windows are pretty much one
and the same I I prefer the locals
window because again you usually get
more uh info that you'll probably need
but yeah both are giving you the most
relevant variables in some capacity in
addition to other default Expressions
that might come about which I talk about
in uh other demos that I've done that
are really cool stuff like return value
uh which can tell you the the value of u
a return statement in your method
without having to necessarily set an
arbitrary variable like the locals
window and the Autos window can tell you
that automatically the moment you step
over that line which is really nice
super cool it's really
nice
one thing I do really love as well that
you guys have put in is this idea that
um you can't get away with changing
something and not being found out so
here if you remember I've changed these
values while the application was um
paused uh and visual studio is flagging
those in red to say hey these were
changed uh which again is it's super
important I think this this idea of
traceability in debugging um it's it's
got to be forensic hasn't it you've got
to know absolutely every single thing
that's happened and has changed so just
that simple feature of coloring those in
red I I love that feature I think it's
really Co I
agree so I think we've agreed most of
the time we're going to use locals but
again totally your choice but you know
it's just about having as much
visibility as possible and um I know
that when I go to I'm always going to
see things that are in scope which is
most of the time what I'm concerned
with so this brings me on to my my last
example which is um one that definitely
tripped me up when I was a junior
developer I hated looking at it not
because it was a visual studio thing but
it was just a programming thing
it just a wall of
text but um it becomes less scary over
time but and that's the call stack
uh and actually Visual Studio does a
really good job of visualizing it
whereas the traditional call stack is
just like a big line of text um block of
text sorry but the the idea on the call
stack is
simply um the everything that's happened
up until this current point and a
representation of that so you'll often
see these in exceptions so when you do a
try catch uh and you hit that that catch
there's going to be some kind of
exception object and that exception
object will have a call stack in it uh
and that will say that the exception
threw at uh a certain point in the code
but before that lots of other things
happened and those things could be other
threads they could be parent functions
but the the common denominator there is
that it's before the current Point yeah
I think timeline of yeah events that are
going on in your code in a lot of ways a
much nicer way of referring to a
timeline um so what I've done here is uh
just created uh a means of viewing the
call stack so we've got a method here
called call stack demo and I'm going to
step into it so I want to go into the
actual method I pressed f11 for that uh
and then I'm going to let these uh
pieces of code run so I'm going to press
F10 to step over I'm going to step over
again to get to this method so we've got
method inside a method and then I'm
going to step into that and we're going
to run that method and then I'm going to
pause it there for a second if I wanted
to see the timeline as Leslie said uh
which is the the call stack uh I can go
again into debug and we've got a really
uh useful Windows section here which
gives us loads of different features
some things that are more advanced uh
than than this in the scope of this uh
video I think uh but uh the one we're
interested in is call stack and you can
see here you can select it and it will
open up the call stack
window uh so I'm just going to move this
I'm going to try and dock it up here
there we go and just bring that across
and so this gives us our timeline this
is the stack of events that have
happened to bring us to this point and
at the top you'll have the method that
you currently in or the break point that
you're currently on so you can see here
we're in call stack sub method at line
73 but before that to get there we'd hit
line 67 and if I double click it will
take me to that line and again we can
see at the bottom of the call stack that
is going to be the first point of entry
our entry point uh because it's the
first thing we went into uh and that's
main as it would be for our uh console
application
uh I think it just hasn't there we
go oh sorry it's uh I am in main yes of
course so it's highlighting call stack
demo but that is in the scope of main so
you can use this to trace back what's
happened to that point uh so I often
find it's a useful refreshing Tool uh if
I'm doing a very long debugging session
so and if I'm doing a long debugging
session it's probably a pretty
complicated bug um but what I mean by
that is if you've spent a lot of time
going through lots of different break
points it's quite easy to sometimes
forget what's happened up until that
point and that might be really important
because uh you might not be seeing any
exceptions throwing but the data that
you've passed through up to that point
might be critical to understanding why
something isn't running uh the way it
should be so if you're in that really
annoying situation where you know
there's a bug but everything looks good
uh the call Stack's really useful
because you can say okay I'm going to
retrace my steps uh and I guess that
that's the main use case for me uh I
don't know Leslie any other sort of
go-to use cases for the call stack that
from from your side yeah a kind of Niche
one that I use it for is in the event
you've got a variable that's being
changed in a spot that you did not
expect it to change but you act but you
also don't really know where that change
could be coming from there one of the
breakpoints I hinted at earlier there's
one called the data breakpoint that lets
you break your uh at your or it lets you
pause your application when a specified
variable changes at any time so it's
really nice because it'll take you to
that exact place where that break where
that variable was changed but there um
there's a speci specific instance where
in the event that variable is actually
like a property in a class or something
it's usually going to take you to like
the setter that you probably set up for
it but that's when you can use the call
stack to figure out who you can really
blame figure out what method just
incremented that uh variable without
your permission and navigate to it that
way which is very helpful so in some
ways the call stack is like the git
blame equivalent of um debugging where
it's like okay what what happened
through my code and could there be a
spot where I I didn't want that to
happen or method to be called in a place
that I did not expect it to be called so
there you go so this no there's no
escaping in Visual Studio forensic data
everywhere you go everything's traceable
yeah and you did mention also threads
and stuff I I think the call stack is
really useful for if you're dealing with
multi-threaded or asynchronous
applications there's lots of instances
where you just want to be able to break
down what is happening on a specific
thread or across multiple threads uh
having a call stack window for that is
extremely important I think absolutely
and and debugging multiple or parallel
execution or concurrency is that's
probably a video in itself isn't it that
that's a oh yeah it's pretty Advanced
but it's uh and it still hurts my brain
but um you know there's a million
different tools that I disposal here so
it always makes it just that bit
easier uh so I mean that's that's my My
overall set of examples for um an
introduction to debugging um but um I
think key takeaways there are that uh
the emphasis is as I said on being as
forensic as possible and making um the
state of any application available to
you uh at that point in time and and I
would my advice to any new developers or
any uh people using uh visual studio for
the first time would be to just start
with breakpoints and and work your way
up through these examples we've we've
locked up um I'd say you know m around
with the immediates figure out how you
can influence the state of the
application uh and break it essentially
uh and maybe create some weird edge
cases and I think once you've had that
hands-on experience you become so much
better at debugging in general um and uh
and it's often a a process of
elimination as well uh so you know you
test your theories you you think I've
got a bug I think it might be this let's
try and disprove that uh and hopefully
you're right and you don't have to
disprove it so you can just put the fix
in yeah I think something that helps me
with debugging is just the whole
expectations versus reality so like
you're thinking about the
meme like that's kind of the thought
process with a lot of debugging it's
like okay what did you expect to happen
but what did you actually end up getting
and that gives you a good starting where
okay how do we get to that cake looking
like what it was supposed to look like
instead of my
mess kind of looks like a tennis court
but really it just looks like a
blob that's yes definitely when I'm
baking cakes for sure oh yeah
yeah awesome well Nick that I thought
that was a great introduction to
debugging I think that's something that
everyone needs like whether you're being
formally taught it or not like I I was
never formally taught how to use the
debugger and then like I joined a
debugger team fresh out of college and I
was freaking out because I was like um
yeah I just statements
when I was debugging in school so like I
don't know um yeah but I I think these
are really useful tools that really you
can take anywhere um whether you're in
BS or in another IDE but you should
totally use vs because the debugger is
amazing um but yeah that's awesome so
where can people go to learn even more
about debugging
Nick um well of course you can go over
to to Microsoft learn um you've got lots
of different videos there and
documentation um and um I mean I think
I've got a few videos on on debugging
you want to head over to Nick proud
programmer Shameless plug um but uh yeah
the documentation for visual studio in
general is is fantastic um you know I'm
using Microsoft learn a lot myself uh
spe specifically for the AO stuff as
well um and you can you know there's
nothing worse than poor documentation
and I've just never had that issue uh
with visual studio uh so um and
obviously the help function in Visual
Studio itself you can get through to all
the documentation you need from the
application uh in a lot of cases as well
uh I've noticed in recently there's been
um links to GitHub repos for specific uh
items as well which is just so cool you
know if you if you want to get some
information on a specific element of net
for example which is largely open source
you can get straight through to the repo
from visual studio so um you can't
really go wrong with with the with the
official docs and then um obviously
resources on YouTube and uh places like
that are probably an
expert yeah awesome and then also more
Shameless plugs on my end I know uh it's
been a minute but this show the visual
studio toolbox show actually we did do a
couple episodes way back when about
debugging so if you uh if you're on
YouTube right now and you do vs toolbox
debugging then there should be several
videos that pop up including one that I
did on more of those Advanced tips and
tricks that we talked about most of them
I I haven't done that talk on the show
since BS 2019 but a lot of those tools
are still very relevant uh for VSS 2022
and also if you're on Twitter go to uh
make sure you subscribe to vsor debugger
that is a great Twitter channel that um
that's run by the debugger team on
visual studio and they drop just cool
tips and tricks at random or sometimes
not at random sometimes they're talking
about new features because we're always
working on new stuff too that are worth
checking out so make sure you subscribe
to
that and yeah I think that's all of our
resources for now hopefully that gets
people started so yeah Nick thank you
yeah but Nick thank you so much for
coming on the show super informative
very important stuff absolute pleasure
thank you so much awesome and thanks to
everyone who's been watching this and is
ready to Kickstart their debugger
journey and until next time happy coding

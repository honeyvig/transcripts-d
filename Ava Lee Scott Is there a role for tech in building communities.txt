My name is Ava Lee Scott
and I am an actor, a creator, 
What exists in me is pure story. 
What our technology does 
for someone like me
is it allows me to create 
the worlds that I have always 
seen, but I had limitations.
AltspaceVR is a virtual
reality social platform
I'm excited about AltspaceVR
because of the simplicity
of bringing people together.
Giving people the power 
in their own hands.
Having people from all over the
world come together for free,
speak of things that they can't 
speak in their country.
Have the freedom to talk about 
their preferences of
the way they want to
live their life
And that AltspaceVR actually
provided a sacred platform
where people can come together
And have these 
beautiful experiences
So I think it's a very 
safe space for
people who are vulnerable and
are trying to find a voice.
This is an exciting time for 
creators in technology
And I feel so honored to be
amongst the group of people
that see outside the box.
With AltspaceVR I felt that I 
can open their hearts.

me Jane a software developer working
late into the night to meet the project
deadlines exhausted and overwhelmed by
the repetitive task and complex
debugging Jane talked about this problem
to her friend and she suggested to use
AI powered coding assistant tools Jane
took the help of AI powered coding
assistant tools which offered her
realtime code suggestions and
explanations allowing her to stay
focused and efficient with its free
powerful autocomplete features it saved
Jane from typing out boilerplate code
and remembering functional arguments
Jane's app security also improved
dramatically with precise vulnerability
detection and oneclick fixes and finally
Jane effortlessly generated functions
debugged and rote documentation with the
help of AI assistant tools Jane met her
deadline and delivered a high quality

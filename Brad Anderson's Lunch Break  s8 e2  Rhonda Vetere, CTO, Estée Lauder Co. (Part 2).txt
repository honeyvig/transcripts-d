- [Narrator] It's lunch time,
and this is Bard Anderson's lunch break.
Here in Redmond,
we're visited by some
of the smartest people
on the planet pretty much everyday.
Every chance I get,
I meet up with them for lunch.
Today I finish talking with
the CTO of Estee Lauder,
a very smart and always
fabulous Rhonda Vetere.
So now let's take a look
at your team itself.
And, you now, the IT department.
How has the morale gone
now that you've moved
so much to the cloud,
how has that morale gone up?
Do people say that their
jobs are more impactful,
or have they this,
this fear that they have, well
maybe my job gets eliminated?
What's been that impact?
- That's been an interesting transition.
And really worked with a team
on the mental model shift.
Their mental model on
growing and spring boarding
into what we call the
new technology world.
The morale is up.
At first you have what I call going
the valley of despair.
And then it goes back up,
just like things in life.
But as you lead and show
them how things come
more productive, how they're giving back,
how they can free up
their time, quite frankly,
and work on more fun things.
And not so fingers on the
keyboard on operational issues.
Their morale goes up.
And we're proud of that.
And there's a lot of rock stars
that have developed out of that.
- So that topic of staying
relevant is really important.
You know, during your career,
you spent time at CompuServe and WorldCom
and MCI.
You've had a front row seat at companies
who were at the pinnacle of
driving different portions
of the industry,
and then kind of fell away, right?
What can technology
leaders learn from that?
What did you take away
from those experiences?
- Being relevant and that you
become obsolete overnight.
And not realize it.
No matter what field that you're in.
Being in technology, you can be merged,
acquisitions, everything happens.
And things are coming
at you from all angles
and you need to be able
to manage that change.
So I took that as a learning experience,
and stayed through all
the different merges
and acquisitions to be
that constant denominator
to drive that change
in making the companies
more relevant as the world changed.
- I read an article where
you listed your top ten
list of business standards.
And there were three of
them that just like really
hit home with me because
I value these three
as much as you do.
One of them is what you
called managerial courage.
- Very good.
- Recognize your team.
And then know your metrics.
- Yes. Recognize your team.
So I'm always about it's the team.
And recognizing them.
It's celebrating success as
most people forget to celebrate.
- It can be little successes
that you celebrate.
That have a tremendous
impact on the culture.
- Absolutely.
- Give me an example.
You talk about leadership courage.
- Leadership courage is the
ability to step up and say
the power of no in a nice way.
I don't agree with this,
this is what it means,
we're doing the wrong thing,
and even on a team and
partners I look for that.
Someone who has a challenging spirit
that can tell you you're
going down a wrong way.
- All too often,
people are afraid to say no.
And most times, you know,
who you're talking to,
they just wanna know what the answer is,
and no is okay.
But it takes courage, and for many people,
that's a courage that has to be developed.
That's actually one of
the interview questions
that I asked when I'm
interviewing senior leaders.
Tell me about a time
when you had to say no
and were convicted that
the right answer was no.
And you knew it was gonna be a challenge
to get the rest of the
organization aligned.
I'll tell you, if people cannot come back
and give me an example of
exactly when they've done that,
they haven't had enough leadership time.
They haven't had enough
leadership experience.
- Great point. That's great.
- It has been a pleasure.
- It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
All right. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
Bye.
- [Brad] Next time on Brad
Anderson's lunch break.
Duckworth-Lewis.
- The Duckworth-Lewis say, I can give a,
it says one of the most
illogical things to happen
in that regard.
Erstwhile, deployment architectures,
you know are a thing of the past.
You can't manage such explosion
with that kind of a thing.

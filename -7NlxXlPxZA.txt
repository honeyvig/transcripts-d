hey Traders guess what you can put chat
GPT directly into your pinescript editor
now with this Chrome browser plugin and
in today's video I'm going to show you
how it works and uh give you an
introduction to this tool it's very very
cool and check this out you can even run
optimizations directly in your browser
uh but more on that later in the
[Music]
video none of the material in this video
is financial advice you should always do
your own research search and due
diligence before engaging in trading or
investing and please seek professional
guidance if you need it so what's this
tool called it is trade sage and it's a
Chrome browser plugin that you can
install for free you can get a free
trial there's a link in the video
description and the pin comment below
it's an affiliate link so if you use my
link it's just a way to support the
channel at no extra cost to you and in
today's video I'm going to show you how
to get started and how to get it set up
so the first thing you'll need to do is
sign up create an account sign in with
Google or create an account here once
you've done that go to the main page and
click add to Chrome now I have already
added this to my Chrome browser uh there
should be a button here to add the
extension to your Chrome browser once
you do that simply jump over to trading
View and the app will be ready to go and
this is what it looks like just down
here this little inconspicuous tab added
to your sidebar you click on that you'll
need to log in I've already signed into
my account but once you've signed in
your account through this uh little
plugin here it's seamlessly integrates
chat GPT directly into your browser and
your trading view Pion script editor
it's pretty cool stuff so what's the
difference between this version of uh
chat GPT and the regular version well
this one is trained on pinescript so
it's actually been taught uh the latest
pinescript documentation and it's custom
built custom tweaked to work
specifically on pin scripts so if you
haven't watched my previous videos on
how I've used chat GPT and pinescript in
the past go and check them out because
um I think it' be really helpful for
those of you who are new to this
technology this tool the vanilla chat
gbt the official um open AI chat gbt
tool isn't very good with pin scripts
it's okay it does a decent job but it's
not fantastic because it's not trained
on pinescript and pinescript is still
somewhat of a niche language I mean only
Traders use it so it's not really you
know even though there's millions of
people using trading view that's still a
niche programming language compared to
things like C C++ python JavaScript all
those sorts of languages so it's not
really good at doing pinescript even
though it can do it okay this on the
other hand is built by a team of Traders
and software developers who have taken
the chat GPT language model and trained
it on pinescript specifically so it's
much much better suited to pinescript
the catch is it's a little bit slower
than the vanilla chat GPT uh but the
trade-off is worth it and I'm sure it'll
get faster over time so in today's video
I just want to introduce you to it I
just want to show you what it's capable
of just some various examples creating
script templates debugging scripts and
playing around with pine script. ideas
um you can see there's some prompts here
just to get started like um explain the
security function if I click on that uh
it will do a better job of explaining
these things probably than the
documentation does or it will at least
give you a second um description that
might help better explain some Concepts
as I've said in the past with tools like
chat GPT and other language models AI
models uh you still need to know what
you're doing if you don't know how
pinescript works these sorts of tools
aren't going to magically solve all your
problems and they are prone to errors
sometimes they will give you incorrect
code or incorrect Solutions sometimes
it'll be complete nonsense and other
times it'll be fantastic 100% accurate
exactly what you need and so if you
don't know the language um at least on
an intermediate level you will probably
still struggle to use these
tools so I still think educating
yourself about pinescript and watching
the other videos on my channel how to
code how to learn um this language is
still important this isn't a crutch that
you can just depend on uh to fix your
lack of knowledge or laziness to not
want to learn U coding and and proper
trading techniques you still need to do
all of that but this tool significantly
speeds up your process I've started
using tools like this almost daily in my
coding process it's become a really uh
really powerful it's like having an
assistant really that's that's the best
way to describe it it's like having an
assistant you don't have to pay and you
you don't have to explain things to you
don't have to uh treat like a human
being that's the world we're heading
into uh but anyway let's break down what
this is capable of let's have a look at
a few examples and again if you want to
play along with this uh play alongside
me doing all of this um go and get this
tool the link is in the video
description and pinned comment below so
here we have clicked The Prompt explain
the use of the security function in
pinescript and here we go let's copy
this code over see if it works paste it
in there I'll jump over to the Daily
chart since this is referencing The
Daily Apple price I'll just go over to
Apple and there you go a hover over uh
last night's close 1733
1733 this AI model has just generated
some code that we can just copy paste
into our script and it's ready to go so
this sidebar tool is really helpful for
exploring ideas asking questions
chatting back and forth with the tool if
you want to iterate on an idea um or
you're trying to understand a concept
better this is a good place to go to do
that if you want help with your actual
script this is where the inline
generator comes in handy so this is
added directly to your Pine editor as
well so you've got two buttons here this
one down here and this one in your Pine
editor if I click on this I can say
something like generate a template
script that
detects uh moving average crossovers
enter now it does take a minute it takes
a little while to generate this code but
there we go click accept it paste that
script into my editor save and we have a
functioning moving average crossover
script let's add some um labels to this
see it's drawing um signals onto the
chart whenever the crossover happens so
now let's ask it to draw labels whenever
there's a buy or sell opportunity on
this um example template um let's
highlight where the signals are detected
and say add text labels to this code on
my chart there we go have a look at that
how quick was that click accept it edits
my script save my code and I should be
now getting labels drawing onto the
chart look at that amazing see what I
mean by how much time this can save
obviously I could have written this out
myself but when it comes to things like
labels I'll often forget what the the
order of the parameters are and I often
have to click the um refer manual and
have a quick look and read through here
and find the find um what I need the
function template add all this code in
with this new tool I can just highlight
some code and say improve it and then
tell it how I want it to go about doing
that let's try something else let's try
asking you to generate a Ballinger band
mean reversion indicator script all
right here we go so we quick look
detecting crossovers of price over the
lower and upper bands okay interesting
let's accept the script save it and add
it to our chart and have a quick look at
what's happening all right not bad
probably using this on bitcoin is not a
good idea you'd probably want to use it
on um on the stock market more than
Bitcoin because Bitcoin doesn't tend to
mean
revert very often this is much better
this is on the S&P 500 you can see these
signals are a lot better than on crypto
um and not not bad not bad here let's
try highlighting this code and say
convert this script into a strategy
script see what
happens let's have a quick look
strategy um entry exit okay not bad it
hasn't added exit signals it's only
going to exit um when an opposite signal
is detected but that's okay for now
let's accept that save the code see how
it looks there we
go interesting let's change our position
size to percentage of equity and drop
this down to a more reasonable
number and click
okay there we go this system uh it's got
a nasty draw down but it's um
technically profitable so that's
interesting now it it needs Improvement
but it's a great template to work with I
can't deny that now it does have some um
deprecated code in here let's get rid of
these and uh save that code let's see if
we can tell it to exit long trades when
when price crosses the middle line and
exit short trades when price crosses
below the middle line see if we can do
that now if you use the tool you'll
learn over time that the quality of the
scripts will depend on the quality of
the prompts and over time you'll learn
um how it responds better and be able to
adapt your prompts based on your
experience with the tool that's been my
experience with the vanilla chat GPT
anyway um all right that looks all right
save our code make sure it's exiting at
the middle
band looks good all right um let's tell
it to remove these
WS um the
when
parameter is
deprecated can you remove it please now
we could obviously remove this ourselves
but I just want to see if we can um ask
questions like this and have it fix the
script so let's have a quick look yep it
removed it awesome accept save the code
and there we have it we have a uh
Ballinger band mean reversion template
system and we wrote barely any code in
this particular script I didn't write
any code I just asked uh prompts
questions so a look at the results a
little bit better but anyway the purpose
of this isn't to create a script it's to
create templates that we can play around
with and we can even run optimizations
directly in the trading view platform
now with this tool so for example if I
wanted to test um this Ballinger band
length from 20 to uh let's say 50 in
steps of five so incrementing this by
five each run I can click Start the tool
is now running several different tests
in the background and when it's done it
will display how those various indicator
options behaved and here we go here's my
list of various profits it even splits
them by long and short and we can even
come down to the bottom here click
export and now I have an Excel
spreadsheet that outputs all of the
various indicator runs or optimization
runs and I can perform additional
analysis on this information but there
you go just some ideas to play around
with it's a pretty cool uh tool there's
a good chance this could become a
regular part of my coding process in the
future uh for example if I'm
experiencing a bug with some code I
could just copy it here um open up the
side panel here paste it in and say uh
explain this code to me and here comes a
detailed description of the code I've um
pasted in here is the most complicated
part of this code um here the standard
deviation of the data series over the
specified length is calculated using the
result Dev represents the deviation
distance that will be added to and
subtracted from the bases to find the
upper and lower bands so yeah you get
the idea this is just a quick
introduction crash course into what this
tool is what it's capable of and in
future videos who knows it might might
uh make another appearance I'll be
leaving this installed and when I'm
working on scripts um if I run into
issues or just want to speed things up I
can use this inline generator to help
with that now again you can get a free
trial for this uh links below so you
don't need to pay anything to play
around with it and see if it's something
that you want to implement into your
coding process now it does need some
work this technology is pretty new
fairly new these language models um but
that's the beauty of uh the way these
things work is that over time they learn
and they get better so this is is just
the beginning of this tool and I'm sure
it's going to improve dramatically in
the years to come if you'd like to learn

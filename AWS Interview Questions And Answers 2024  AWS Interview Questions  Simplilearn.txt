get started as a bonus in this video
along with the top 20 frequently ask
questions we will also cover five
questions based on case studies that you
can definitely expect in your AWS
interview so the first question is what
is AWS and what are its key components
AWS or Amazon web services is a cloud
computing platform offered by Amazon it
provides a wide range of services like
computing power storage options and
networking capabilities key components
include ec2 elastic computer Cloud for
virtual servers S3 or simple storage
service for scalable storage RDS
relational database service for managed
data bases and I am identity and access
management for security you can also
Imagine AWS like a huge toolbox which
has everything you need to build and run
your applications without worrying about
infrastructure you have ec2 which is
like the section for renting virtual
computers S3 for storing your file
securely RDS for managing databases and
I am for controlling who can access what
now what is the difference between ec2
and S3 EC C2 provides resizable compute
capacity in the cloud allowing you to
run applications S3 or simple storage
service on the other hand is storage for
the internet ec2 is like having a
computer in the cloud while S3 is more
like having a hard drive in the cloud
where you can store files think of E2 as
a rented computer in the cloud you can
install software run applications and do
pretty much anything you would do on a
regular computer now S3 on the other
hand is more like a giant external hard
drive
you can store all your files there like
images videos or backups and access them
from anywhere on the internet now let's
move on to the third question explain
the concept of elastic load balancing or
elb now elb automatically distributes
incoming application traffic across
multiple targets such as ec2 instances
containers and IP addresses to ensure no
single resources is overwhelmed elb is
like having a traffic manager for your
website or application it automatically
spreads incoming visitors or requests
across multiple servers so that no
single server gets overwhelmed it's like
having a multiple cash registers open at
a store during rush hour let's move on
to the next question what is auto
scaling in AWS Autos scaling
automatically adjusts the number of ec2
instances in a group based on demand it
helps maintain application availability
and allows you to only pay for the
resources you actually need so Autos
scale SC is like having a magical
elastic band around your servers when
there's a sudden spike in traffic to
your website or application autoscaling
automatically adds more servers to
handle the load and when the traffic
slows down it removes those extra
servers so you don't waste money on
unused resources now describe the
difference between I am users groups and
roles I am users are individuals within
your AWS account where groups are
collections of users roles are similar
to users but they are meant to be
assumed by other AWS services or users
for specific tasks okay imagine you are
the boss of your AWS account I am users
are like your employees they can log in
and do stuff but only what you allow
them to groups select teams of users
with similar permissions and roles are
like special hats that users or even
other services can wear to do specific
tasks now the sixth question is what is
Amazon RDS Amazon RDS are relation
database service is a managed relational
database service that makes it easier to
set up operate and scale a relational
database in the cloud Amazon RDS is like
having a personal database expert on the
call it takes care of all the basic
details of setting up operating and
scaling a relational database like MySQL
or post SQL so you can focus on building
your app instead of worrying about
database management now explain the
difference between Amazon RDS and Amazon
Dynamo DB RDS is for relational
databases and SQL Server while Dynamo DB
is a fully managed no SQL database
service provided by AWS RDS is like a
traditional database with tables rows
and SQL queries while Dynamo DB is more
like a super fast super flexible storage
system for all kinds of data from simple
text to complex jent documents it's like
comparing a filling cabinet to a magic
box that can hold anything you throw at
it now what is Amazon VPC Amazon VPC or
Amazon virtual private cloud is like
having your own private corner of the
AWS Cloud it's a virtual Network that
you can set up and customize to keep
your resources isolated and secure think
of it as creating your own little
neighborhood within the vast city of AWS
now what is the difference between
public and private subnets in Amazon VPC
imagine public subnets or houses with
doors facing the street they're directly
accessible from the internet
private subnets on the other hand are
like houses with backyard entrances
they're shielded from direct internet
access making them perfect for storing
sensitive data or running internal
Services moving on to the 10th question
how does cloud front work and what are
its benefits Cloud front is like having
a network of delivery trucks all around
the world ready to bring your content
closer to your users when someone
requests a file from your website or
application cloudfront finds the nearest
delivery truck or Edge location and
serves the file from there reducing
latency and speeding up the overall
experience for your users now what is
the difference between Amazon S3 and EBS
Amazon S3 is a giant storage locker in
the cloud where you can dump all your
files and they'll be safe and accessible
from anywhere ABS on the other hand is
more like renting a hard drive that you
can attached to your virtual server you
can install your operating system and
applications on it just like you would
on a regular computer now the next
question explain the difference between
the Stop and terminate actions in ec2
when you stop an ec2 instance it's like
putting your computer to sleep all the
data and settings are saved and you can
start it back up later without losing
anything but when you terminate an
instance it's like shutting down your
computer and throwing it away you lose
everything and you can't bring it back
now what is aw's Lambda and how does it
work AWS Lambda is like having a team of
tiny workers waiting in the cloud to
execute your code whenever you need them
you just upload your code to Lambda
Define when you want it to run and
Lambda takes care of everything else
scaling monitoring and billing you only
for the compu time you actually use so
let's move on to the next question how
do you secure your data addressed in AWS
think of securing your data address like
locking it in a safe AWS offers various
encryption options to keep your data
safe from crying eyes whether it's
stored in S3 buckets databases like RDS
or even on your EBS volumes you can use
AWS managed encryption keys or bring
your own keys for added security moving
on what is cloud formation and how does
it work cloud formation is like having a
blueprint for your entire AWS
infrastructure instead of manually
setting up each resource you define
everything you need in a template file
using simple Json or yl syntax
then with a single click cloud formation
creates and configures all the resources
for you saving your time and ensuring
consistency now the next question
explain the differences between Amazon
S3 EBS and EFS Amazon S3 is a versatile
storage solution for the files of all
types accessible from anywhere EBS or
elastic Block store is more like a
traditional hard drive attached to a
single ec2 instance perfect for storing
data that require slow latency access
now EFS or elastic file system on the
other hand is like a shared network
drive that multiple ec2 instances can
access simultaneously making it ideal
for shared file storage across multiple
instances now what is Amazon sqs and how
does it work Amazon sqs or Amazon simple
Q Service is like having a virtual queue
for your messages in the cloud when one
part of your application sends a message
sqs holds on to it until another part of
your application is ready to receive and
process it it helps decouple different
components of your system making them
more resilient and scalable yeah now the
next question is what is the difference
between Amazon S3 and glacia Amazon S3
is like having a storage locker where
you can quickly access your files
whenever you need them glacia on the
other hand is more like putting your
files in Cold Storage it's cheaper but
slower to retrieve it's perfect for data
that you don't need to access frequently
but still want to keep for archival
purposes now what is AWS elastic bean
stock you can relate AWS elastic bean
stock to a personal chef who takes care
of all the cooking and serving while you
focus on enjoying your meal so it
automates the deployment and management
of your web applications handling all
the heavy lifting of provisioning
servers load balancing and scaling so
you can just upload your code and let
elastic beant stock take care of the
rest now coming to the last question on
our list how do you monitor AWS
resources and services monitoring AWS
resources can be explained as having a
dashboard that shows you how your
applications and services are performing
in real time ads offers various
monitoring tools like cloudwatch which
collects and tracks metrics logs and
events from your resources an AWS
trusted advisor which provides
recommendations for optimizing your AWS
environment based on best practices and
cost efficiency and that wraps up a
rundown of the top 20 AWS interview
questions but wait let's have a look at
those five bonus questions now number
one you are setting up a website for a
small shop using AWS how would you
choose the right AWS tools to make sure
the website stays fast and reliable
whether there are only a few visitors or
a lot of people shopping at once during
a big sale your second question imagine
you are like a tech detective
investigating why a website's database
is slow for a busy online shop how would
you use AWS tools to find out what's
causing the problem and make the
database super fast again number three
as the hero for a startup your mission
is to control their AWS costs while
still allowing them to grow how would
you do this making sure they can expand
without spending too much money or
slowing down their operations now your
fourth question a nonprofit organization
needs help migrating their data to AWS
what steps would you take to ensure a
smooth transition considering their
limited budget and Technical expertise
and the last question we have a startup
wants to store their customer data
securely on AWS how would you recommend
they do this considering both cost and
security try answering these questions

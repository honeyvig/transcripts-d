we wanted to create a game of such
massive scale that's never been created
before we really wanted it to run
naturally in the browsers anyone can
play it immediately whether it's your
laptop or your phone or your PC we were
Building A system that could cope with
huge demand and huge concurrency huge
availability around about the same time
service fabric came about say two
alliances suddenly decide to go to war
on a whim they all meet in space at the
same time to Duke it out our
microservices in azur service fabric
will automatically scale up begin
unfolding space and seamlessly
distribute the load across all the nodes
in the system we've tested it up to
50,000 concurrent players in the same
battle arena we were handling 267
million application messages a second
our game microservices are built using
asp.net core it gives us Superior
performance asp.net core is an open
source that allows us to contribute back
to it if we have any performance issues
which then Microsoft review and together
we make a better product our
contributions to castal have reduced
allocations lowered latencies and
allowed it to be already
2,300 faster than previous incarnations
of asp.net and more than six times
faster than no. JS we run public player
versus player Alpha play tests once a
month where anyone can just drop in all
you need is a modern browser that runs
webgl turn up at the website and you can
play the game against other players
around the world

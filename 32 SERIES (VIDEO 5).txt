tumors that also produced diffused
mucocutaneous pigmentation similar to
adrenal insufficiency point number seven
the systemic disease that may increase
oral male noses piece albright syndrome
point number eight hypophosphite Asia is
the condition where deficiency of enzyme
alkaline phosphatase along with
excretion of phosphorus an ala mine in
urine and absence of cementum is seen
whereas hypophosphatemia is vitamin D
resistant rickets
point number nine osteomalacia is a
condition where
is seen in newly-formed organic bone
matrix point number 10
rickets is a condition where defect is
seen in the mineralization of
endochondral new pole point number 11
deficiency of vitamins a CD causes
enamel hypoplasia point number 12
alcoholic patients with chronic thiamine
deficiency shows CNS manifestations such
as vernix encephalopathy now along with
this if there is loss of memory as well

now that's going to be a point number 13
now moving on to point number 14 in
porphyria the sidious and permanent
teeth may show a red or brownish
discoloration and exhibit red
fluorescence point number 15 her
Lascelles or ghazal cells that is
abnormal fibroblasts are the
characteristic histological finding of
furless syndrome
whereas in cytoplasm of circulating
lymphocytes we find metachromatic
granules or rly bodies point number 16
claw hands broadening of mandible with a
widened econo distance are features of
hurler syndrome point number 17 draw a
beefy tongue and ball tongue of Sandwich
is associated with nian deficiency point
number 18 magenta color tongue is
associated with riboflavin deficiency
point number 19 molars glossitis or
hunters glossitis is associated with
vitamin b12 deficiency point number 20
the old term histiocytosis X is replaced
by new term called Langerhans cell
histiocytosis that is LCH the presence
of Burdick's granules is the
characteristic finding in Langerhans
cell histiocytosis point number 21
generalized gingival inflammation
profuse elevation and scalding or skin
from palm and foot is associated with
Hey
metal poisoning or toxicity now LED
mercury bismuth and arsenic are the
metals that cause heavy metal poisoning
or toxicity these get deposited in the
Ural tissues and extravasated in areas
of chronic inflammation
now additional to this the systemic
signs and symptoms that may include our
behavioral changes neurologic disorders
intestinal pain and solarium join number
22 diabetes insipidus bone lesions and
exophthalmos is seen in hand Sheila
Christian disease point number 23 giant

finding in the case of brown tumor of
hyperparathyroidism
point number 24 bone pain bone cyst

level is 9 to 11 milligram percentage
now point number 28 lamina dura is lost
or partially lost in the case of
hyperparathyroidism point number 29
tetiny is associated with a low
concentration of ionized calcium in the
serum point number 30 intestinal
absorption of calcium is decreased by
phytic acid point number 31 amyloid can
be demonstrated by special stains like
Congo red violet and high of Flavin tea
fluorescent technique point number 32
Congo red staining is the gold standard
for the diagnosis of amyloidosis biopsy
is usually taken from the gingiva or the
rectal tissue or any other suspected
involved issue
oh here amyloid shows apple-green
birefringence under polarized light
thank you

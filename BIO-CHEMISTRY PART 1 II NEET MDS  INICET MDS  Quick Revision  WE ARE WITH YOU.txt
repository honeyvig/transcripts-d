yeah happiness
a very good morning
happiness this is dr srikant
from team mds concur now i'll be
discussing biochemistry
so it's already discussed many times
that biochemistry is one
among the list which is rarely or
solidly memory based
okay so conceptual things will be very
very limited
so it's more of a memory based and it
should be the subject of choice
and that should be taken or revised in
the last three days for the preparation
so hope hope you remember that we have
discussed the different types that is
the three types of
performance and out of which euro is
most important they have asked the
question like which is the most soluble
warfare and that is
europe or fire the least is proto
the next goes is the synthesis okay
the biosynthesis of heme so for
basic biosynthesis of heme that is
leading to the formation of
a l a okay the primary enzyme
that can be considered as the enzyme
that is required is
ala synthetase okay so ala synthesis
okay so this is just a combination of
glycine
plus succinyl coa in the presence of ala
synthetase
leading to the formation of l a
which occurs in the case of your
mitochondria
the next comes as we are discussing ala
alas are of two types that is the type
one
and type two so just do make a note
about the difference where typhoon is
present what is the use of typhoon
and type 2 the next comes most of you
are familiar with this cp case
cpk123 these are the three isomers that
are present in the cpk cp
helps in the conversion of
phosphocreatine
to creatine cpk1 is present in the case
of your brain
two is present in the case of your heart
and three is present in the case of your
skeletal muscle most common regularly
asked questions
the next goes uh the enzymes in the case
of your myocardial infarction
that is the first enzyme that you can
see in the myocardial infarction is cpk
and the last that you can see is ldh you
can remember last l
for lldh and the other enzyme that you
can see is
ast or sjot so these are the enzymes
these are the three enzymes primarily
which you can see
apart from this they are something
called as troponins these are the
markers
okay they are cardiac proponents they
can be troponin i and troponin t
okay so these are comparatively i mean
like you can see troponin is first
followed by the cpk followed by
szot followed by ldh
so this is this is one more variation
regularly most of your books just
just stick on to the first marker is
the troponins or uh the next important
aspect that they focus
is cp case okay regularly so apart from
this there is one more thing called as
b fabp what is that f a b p called as
fabp is nothing but
heart type or cardiac type fatty acid
binding protein okay this is the one
which is seen first
which is missing in most of the books
this is just an advancement of the
question
which of the following marker is most
commonly seen in the case of myocardial
infarction
if you don't have the answer troponins
it's better if i mean if you have an
answer to openness yeah you can go for
it
but the advanced option is going to be
fabp that is fatty acid
binding protein you can see this this
again this is this is a
graph that is regularly asked okay so
which are seen first okay if your bb is
followed by troponins followed by cpks
followed by sgot and last but not the
least is ldh
so i was talking about ldh so basing
upon this electrophoresis
uh your your isotopes isotope
iso enzymes are going to be divided like
basing up on the electrophoresis there
is
type 1 type 2 type 3 type 4 and type 5
type 5 is the slowest
type 1 is the fastest type 1 is most
positive
okay and type 1 is present in the case
of your heart muscle type 5 is present
in the case of your skeletal muscle
in a normal individual you have more
type 2 when compared to that of the type
1.
whenever the patient is having cardiac
problems there will be drift to the type
1 this is called as flipping you have
something called as flipping
isotope a flipping isotope of heart is
regularly you'll have two more
whenever the two is drifted and one is
more then is called as flipping
and in the case of liver diseases you
will have ldh5 as the
predominant one and these branchings are
important okay which are
completely memory based uh i hope like
most of this stuff is covered in your pp
books
just go with this okay so i mean like
what what is the branching
and everything okay so do make a note
about uh
what is the branching this is the
branching this is these are the
branchings okay so please do make
another this completely memory waste
make a note of these branchings carbides
are different divided into simple
carbohydrates complex carbohydrates
so regularly as what is which is
disaccharide okay so these are the
disaccharides
these are the monosaccharides
the next course what is the use of dna
helicase enzyme so what is the use of
dna helicase enzyme this is an enzyme
that unwinds the double helix by
breaking the hydrogen bonds between the
complementary so these are the two
complementary things
and these complementary things are
attached by the hydrogen bonds and dna
helicase is enzyme which is going to
break this hydrogen bonds there's
something called as
endonuclease endonuclease is a
restricted enzyme
which recognizes and cleavages the
particular sequence okay in the presence
of
mg plus two factors that are influencing
the enzymes
first the important factor is the
temperature okay so what is going to be
temperature as temperature increases
the velocity of the enzyme increases up
to an optimum level that is something
around like 40 degrees
and then decreases this is this is the
bell bell shaped curve
the next goes is the ph as the ph
increases
it increases and it drops this is also a
bell shape
this is also a bell shaped then goes
with the classification of enzymes i
hope like most of you are familiar with
this classification
make a note about the order the sequence
is very important
o t h l i
l okay so the sequence is very important
they're gonna give you this example and
they're gonna ask you
what type of reaction or they can give
you the examples you can see
uh nad oxidase okay you can see
cytochrome oxidase
you can see d amino acids all this comes
under oxidoreductases
the next one characteristics of the
enzymes enzyme is a protein
enzyme is heat level water level and it
consisting of 16 percentage of nitrogen
so there is something called as term
called as q2 q2 is nothing but
temperature coefficient of the nj so
what does q2 means
it is a factor by which the rate of
enzyme increases
for every 10 degrees increasing the
temperature so as we have discussed like
as temperature increases
the rate of reaction of enzyme increases
right so
how much time it is increased by
increasing 10 degrees how much time it
is increased is nothing but
q10 and more for most of the engines the
q10 value is
2 the next comes is what is v max v max
is the maximum velocity
and what is km km is the substrate level
concentration
km is the substrate level concentration
at which the velocity is going to be
half of the maximum velocity
so k m concentration is the substrate
concentration to produce the
maximum velocity half of the maximum
velocity so
do make a note of these concepts low km
value indicates a strong affinity
between the engine and the substrate so
to have a strong affinity you should
have low km value means
low substrate concentration is going to
produce the maximum velocity
km values are something like a thumb
prints of thumb prints of an enzyme
km value does not depends upon the
concentration of enzymes so these are
the points that you have to
make you node okay normal reaction is
going to be how
you are going to have an active site
substrate is going to come in bond this
is
substrate an enzyme complex so once the
reaction is done the substrate is going
to
go off and enzyme is going to be normal
so there is something called as
competitive
inhibitor non-competitive inhibitor
competitive inhibitor means
your substrate and your inhibitor they
have both structurally they're
same they're same and they compete for
the active site
so what is competitive inhibitor there
is some computation for the active set
that is called as competitive inhibitor
the second one is
the the non-competitive inhibitor this
the substrate
and the inhibitor are structurally
different and they don't fight for the
active sets
as they are not competiting for the
active sites it is called as
non-competitive inhibitor
so you have to make a note about the
differences of competitive or
non-concurrent twitter
which is the most commonly asked
question please do be perfect with each
and every length the concepts regarding
these lines but
discuss when we are going with the
normal classes for now you have to be
thorough with this table if you don't
have concepts even then mug up this this
is
mandatory if they are planning to give a
question on this area
this difference is a very very favorite
area for most of the paper centers
next coming to the structure of enchant
okay hollow enzyme is nothing but the
functional group of engine
what does it contain it consisting of
two parts one is protein part which is
called as apoenzyme
and the second one is non-protein part
which is called as the co-enzyme
and the prosthetic group is the group
which bonds this protein product to
non-protein part
so this is called a central dogma of the
life that is the dna
which is going to i mean undergo
transcription leading to the formation
of rna
which it's going to undergo translation
leading to the form of the
protein so reverse transcriptase means
our dna formed from the rna is called as
reverse transcription
so i hope most of you are familiar with
this what is the difference between the
nucleoside and nucleotide and
what are the uh i mean like what are the
ammonia acids that are present in your
uh
rna dna what is the difference between
here you have your isolate here you have
diamond so next comes the double helical
structure given by watson and click make
you know the nobel prize was given in
the year 1962.
it's one of the major milestone in the
case of your modern biology and
uh the futures of watson and clicker
basically
on on b d and a different types of dna
are there
so their structure is basically bdna so
do make a note they run parallely in a
antiparallel direction
one from five five to three direction
and three from phi two direction
okay so do make a node about three point
four zero point three nanometers
what is this all these very very
important so with what is the width
what is the what each turn the what is
the pitch of each turn of the helix
how many base pairs are present in each
turn what are the bondings
what are the side wise bondings what are
the uh what is the bonding between g
and c number of hydrogen bonds here uh
between a and t
number of hydrogen bonds between the g
and c all these are very very important
this particular rule is again
the most common areas most of of of
these concepts are very familiar to you
so we have discussed many many of these
concepts we have done
many problem solving on these areas i
hope you are and coming to i'm just
going to give a brief idea so this is a
main chain
so they can give you the description of
the main chain and they can ask you the
complementary chain okay
so what's complementary chain is a is
going to be replaced by t t
is going to be replaced by a g is going
to be replaced by c
and c is going to be replaced by g so
this is what the complement residential
is
in the in the question they're gonna
they can give you the main chain they're
gonna ask you the complementary chain
followed by so main chain and
complementary chain we are done with so
next is transcription so what happens in
the transcription
transcription your rna is going to be
formed so what is going to rna so
and one more thing uh your main chain is
in the direction of
5 is to 3 and your complementary chain
will be in the anti parallel it will be
in the direction of 3
3 3 5 whereas your once the
transcription is done
your t's are going to replace by use
that is the only thing because that's
the difference between the dna and rna
so a a t is u replaced by u
c c g is g a is a
and t is replaced by u and g is replaced
by g so this is called as transcription
and the mrn sequence is ready so once
the
mrna sequence is ready so this is a main
chain we are done with the complementary
chain
now your mrna sequence is ready and
three gives rise to formation of one
ammonia acid
right so this is an ammonia acid so they
can ask a number of hydrogen bonds
so a and t has two hydrogen bonds c
and g has three hydrogen bonds by
counting the number of hydrogen bonds
okay they'll give you that this is x
percent x
is the amount of energy required to
break one hydrogen bond
so how much of energy is required to
break this double standard dna so by
counting the number of hydrogen bonds
you'll get the energy levels and glucose
6-phosphate is an important compound
that joins many metabolic pathways
so what are the metabolic pathways which
are linked to the glucose 6 phosphate as
these
and of course you have many questions on
this enzymes recently in the
last neet exam that is ast and
alt that is asperted ammonium
transferase
okay so when you compare these ratios
you can identify most of the liver
diseases
if it is less than one then it it's
going to be hepatocellular damage
if it is more than when it is cirrhosis
of the liver if it is more than three it
is
alcoholic liver disease
and coming to i mean like you have you
have a question on this area also too in
the
direct take and from your offline class
that is the addition of fluoride okay so
what happened to the
addition of the fluoride so when the
fluoride is added fluoride is going to
react to the magnesium
to form magnesium fluoride which results
in the decreasing of the magnesium
available
and that is the major ion which is which
is required
for the activation of analyze engine
okay so fluoride is going to inhibit
is is is going to inhibit the analyze
enzyme
which is which is basically uh helps in
the process of glycolysis
so what happens like what what is the
anticoagulant that is added to this uh
uh in the in the blood blanks is uh that
is potassium oxalate
and what is that glycolytic inhibitor
you you're going to you should prevent
the process of glycolysis
so glycolysis can be prevented by adding
nf because the f is going to react with
the magnesium there and it's going to
inhibit the analyze engine
and do make a note the cancer cells they
divide rapidly and they lack
an excessive capillary network for
oxygen supply and that glycolysis is the
main pathway by which they get the
energy supply
so glutes are important not as in the
last two or three needs but
uh uh it's it's a is of like
in 2001 to 2015 you have many question
every exam has questions on glutes and
this is an important table
that you have to make a note the next
comes are the
uh phosphorylation state
reactions energy phosphorylation
reaction so this is a reaction in
tricarboxylic acid cycle or krebs cycle
and these are the two reactions
in in glycolysis so this is a new
modified generation of atp most of you
in the recent two or three days were
asking so many questions related to the
calculations
in most of the mcq books this still did
not change the updated version but this
is the latest thing
that is available from your satin arena
so please do make a note of these
classifications
make a note about the old
classifications also if you find new
classification option go for a new
classification option
if you don't find new then you can go
for a gold because repeats
are repeats always okay so if they're
giving a repeat over this area you have
to go for
old okay you have to go for old because
if you don't find option
which is related to the new then you can
go for the old options
what is respiratory coefficient so
respiratory coefficient is the volume of
carbon dioxide produced by the volume of
oxygen consumed for unit time
so it's going to be six by six and it's
going to be one for the carbohydrates
what is the difference between the
saturated unsaturated fatty acids and
most of you are well aware of this
so please do make a note and this is a
classification that is very very
important so they can ask you
which of the following is saturated or
all of the following or saturated fatty
acids except
so they can ask even even like the
questions related to the
like the formulas and everything are
being asked in various examinations
okay but do make you know at least the
classifications okay all these
classifications what are saturated what
are unsaturated what they smart and
everything are important
the next comes is the anion gap anyone
gap can be defined as the difference
between the
total number of method cations on one
side to the measured area
on other side that is giving the anion
gap anion gap is nothing but
unmeasured anions in the plasma so
what's going to be it's going to be 36
plus 4
it's going to be 100 plus 25 so total
the anion gap ranges from
8 to 18 milli equivalents per liter so
basing upon this anion gap
most of your acid-base reactions or the
acid-base relationship of the disorders
will be there
please do make a note about this acid
based stuff okay so
2020 neet doesn't have a question on
this but it's a very familiar thing that
they regularly ask i want you to go
to your acid base uh reactions okay uh i
mean like we have
we have one or two lectures on this one
one taken by me and one taken by pradhan
sir
so i want you guys to go just have a
look all the normal values
your partial pressure of oxygen carbon
dioxide bicarbonate values
the many other values that you have to
make a note and you have to conclude
what is what is this okay so whether it
is respiratory alkalosis respiratory
acidosis are all the four options how it
is compensated everything so please do
make another is very very important
so this is next is the catechol
catecholamine biosynthesis so this flow
chart is very very important in enzymes
it starts with phenylalanine in the
presence of hydrolyzed enzyme it's going
to convert into
l-thyroxine and in the presence of again
a engine it's going to convert into l
dopa
in the presence of decarburis it's going
to convert into dopamine in the presence
of hydrolyzed it's going to convert a
non-epinephrine in the place in the
presence of methyl transfer is going to
convert into epinephrine
so all this sequence is important
they're going to ask you which engine
converts this to that or they can ask
you uh the starting product of the
ending products many questions were
there on this particular area which
reaction
for example uh recently in one of the
examination they have asked
what is the type of reaction for
converting the l dopa to that of the
dopamine the answer is
d carboxylase at glycemic index most of
you are familiar with this glycemic
index so please do read
read this is a formula for the glycemic
index and do make a note
glycemic index of a complex carbohydrate
is
lower than refined carbohydrate so for a
refined carbohydrate you have more
glycemic index and these values are very
very important so
more most refined and simplified
carbohydrate is your
glucose so glucose will have more
glycemic index when compared to that of
any of these
okay so they can ask you hi how high
glycemic index
low glycemic index anything can they ask
so i hope most of you are
familiar with this marple syrup
urine what are the what are the ammonia
acids that are present in this what are
the branched chain
thing stuff that are present in this
okay so please do we we learned so much
related to this many questions in your
mock examinations
so please do learn and i hope most of
you are familiar with this western
rotten technique is is to identify the
proteins and it is a
it's a test of choice for your screening
test for your aids
okay and southern blotting technique is
something like it's for dna you can
remember it a south indian dna
and north indian rna okay so please do
make a note of all these contents i mean
most of these contents are well
organized
and arranged in your pp books which are
solidly memory based so yuria cycle most
of your questions will move around this
area
okay so please do make a note the defect
and the enzyme involved in it
and please do make a note about the
lipid storage diseases too
glycogen storage diseases they can ask
you the type because this is a question
that is given in 2018 and 2019 need
also very very important area favorite
area for questions for the pepper status
and of course you're well familiar with
what are essential ammonia acids
okay this is the curd what are the
non-essential amino acids this is a curd
do make it out basing up on the
metabolism ketogenic
ammonia acids ketogenic and glycogenic
glycogenic so what are they please do
make a note there is something called as
semiation shall amino acid that was th
that was the question given
in the recent need according to few of
you okay if you don't find uh the option
uh essential then you can go for semi
essential and essential okay
so please do learn what is what is the
why they are called a semiation shell
okay what are the other names of
essential knowledge please do go through
this this table is going to help you out
what is what is 21st ammonia acid what
is 20 second ammonia acid
what are the uses of this to make a note
if you think
sulfur containing amino acids cmc and
acid common assets will have all the
acids in it
and please do make you know this this
aspectic acid is
helpful in the root is estimation which
is given one of the examination what are
basic amino acids what are aromatic
amino acids
and few functional groups okay which i
have given in the mock examinations if
i'm not wrong in ironic
mock examinations i have given decent
number of mcqs on the functional groups
including the synopsis
so please do check that okay so all
these ammonia acid classifications are
very very important which should not be
skipped
what is this dipolar ion ion which has
both the positive as well as the
negative
charge please do go through this what is
isoelectric ph it is defined as a
ph at the mole molecules exhibit both
the positive and negative having a net
value zero so this isoelectric ph is ph
six
so vitamin a deficiency what is the
first sign that is seen what is the
first symptom that is seen
what are biotic spots and you can see
how they are clinically
many times given and discussed on the
group very very important
for diagram based stuff okay so please
do read this
high concentration of retinol increases
senses of lysozyme
hydroxylase and you can make a note
vitamin a excess of vitamin a
okay can lead to diseases related to the
lysosomes
lysosome cell organelle okay hyper i
mean two vitamins which can be seen as
an
hyper vetaminosis is a and d okay
so please do make a note about the
antioxidant properties
antioxidant properties vitamins are a c
and e
most anti antioxidant properties seen in
the case of an
e the next comes is the vitamin d what
is vitamin
d2 what is d3 okay so what are the
sources of these vitamins okay
these are called as pro vitamins okay
vitamin which acts as a hormone
is preferably d followed by a even a
axis in a hormone according to your
shopping better
reference so they can give you so
regularly
uh vitamin which resembles the steroid
structure and functions like in a
hormone is d
and vitamin which can also act as a
hormone is vitamin a
because of its epithelialization okay so
this is a sequence that you have to make
you know what happens in skin
what happens in liver what happens in
kidney
so the consequences okay so whenever the
plasma uh calcium level is low what
happens
okay your parathyroid hormone increases
calcitrol increases and leading to
all these consequences and this is a
very important thing about the synthesis
of
him okay senses of him and how it it
undergoes
conversion to bilirubin
and enters the hepatic circulation and
excretes in the feces
nowadays your hepatocellular
jaundice obstructed jaundice different
types of jaundice or all these are the
questions which moves around this
concept
so please do make a note about these
vitamin
d deficiency metaphysis okay so please
do make a note about this
uh diagram based stuff okay
regardless the spine is seen in the case
of okay so what does it actually mean
you can see in ct scan then after
this is a typical thing that is called a
sandwich vertebra okay so please do go
with
the sandwich vertebra which is seen in
the case of osteopetrosis
this is also seen in the case of vitamin
d rickets
yeah i'm done for now signing off dr
srikant from
team mds conquer and
all the best guys make a note
biochemistry is important
your pp books and your dental pulse
synopsis your synopsis and your pp books
and dental pulse are mandatory
please do have a glance because there is
a solidly memory based i don't want you
to skip
or miss any question in the final exam
related to the stuff which is
already been done by most of the
competitors
bye take care

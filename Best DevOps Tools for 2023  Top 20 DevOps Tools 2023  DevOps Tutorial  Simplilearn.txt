without further Ado let's get started
before diving into the tools let's
Briefly summarize the devops phases
devops phases are a series of
interconnected steps that streamline
software development and deployment
here's a crisp explanation of each stage
first plan Define project goals
requirements and Milestones plan takes
prioritize work and establish a roadmap
for development next is code developers
write and review code collaboratively
using Version Control Systems to manage
changes and ensure code quality the
third one is build convert the code into
executable software components including
compiling linking and packaging the code
base four-step testing automated testing
is performed to validate the software's
functionality performance and security
and this includes unit testing
integration tests and system tests the
first stage is the release stage prepare
the software for deployment by
finalizing features documentation and
versioning ensure all necessary
approvals and compliance requirements of
meth sixth one and deploy move the
software to Target environment whether
it is on-premises or the cloud this
involves setting up infrastructure
configuring resources and installing the
software now the seventh one operate
minus D is software and infrastructure
in a production environment monitor
system Health address operational issues
and ensure smooth functioning the eighth
one is monitoring phase continuously
monitor the software's performance
availability and security collect
metrics analyze logs and identify and
resolve any anomalies or bottlenecks
these stages form a continuous loop
allowing for iterative development rapid
feedback and continuous Improvement
devops enhances collaboration Automation
and efficiency throughout the software
development life cycle by integrating
development and operations team now
let's discuss the tools the primarily
used and prominent ones in each phase
starting with planning jeera and Trello

lists and cards to represent task
workflows and Milestones these tools
provide teams with the necessary
functionalities to plan organize and
track tasks ensuring Clarity
transparency and alignment of planning
phase of devops projects now proceeding
ahead we will discuss about the next
phase which is the coding phase the
important tools here are get Visual
Studio firstly get git is a widely used
distributed version control system that
plays a crucial role in coding phase of
devops it allows developers to attract

now before we conclude let us hear from
our Learners about their success story
after getting certified by simply learns
postgraduate program from Caltech in
collaboration with IBM
foreign
[Music]
we're actually brothers and we live here
in Alberta Canada we do a lot of things
together
and this time we decided to take a
course in devops from Simply learn the
course proved to be very beneficial for
both our careers yeah I got a promotion
after the course and I got a hire with a
new company
I'm actually a mechanical engineering
graduate and I've been working at my
company for the last four years in 2020
I came to know that my company was
starting the hiring process for devops
infrastructure team at the time I was
working as an implementation specialist
and my colleagues recommend that I take
a course in devops if I wanted to be
part of a team so I started doing my
research and then he came to me saying
that he was also looking for a devops
course yeah funny enough I actually
found the course through Instagram but
you know my situation was slightly
different I had been working as a
geomatic field technician for about four
years but I wanted to change my career
into something that involved more
programming and automation so when I
came across with this course I said you
know what let's take it
and caltex name was definitely a
deciding factor in July 2021 we got our
certifications and I immediately posted
that on my LinkedIn profile you know
coincidentally in November of that same
year we got the good news
and I got hired as a dis developer
which has allowed me to do way more
programming which is what I wanted to do
around that time I got promoted to the
devops infrastructure team and saw a 21
salary hike the overall course was
awesome but the part that I enjoyed the
most was a Docker certification training
you know what I also really enjoyed the
docker certification training I think
there were brothers after all
yeah the experience was amazing and
being able to study together was
definitely very nice yeah it brought us
back to those good old days when we were
going to school together and with and we

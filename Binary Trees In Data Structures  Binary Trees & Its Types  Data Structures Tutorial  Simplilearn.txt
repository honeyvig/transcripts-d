hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about binary trees in data
structures but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies if you are a
tech gig in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
so we shall begin our session by
learning a binary tree and some basic
terms related to binary tree then we
will try to implement it in the code
editor after that we will discuss its
properties then we will discuss
different types of binary trees then we
will try various operations on them like
traversal insertion and deletion
and finally we will take a glance on
what are our final key takeaways from
this session but before we begin make
sure that you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and click on that bell
icon to never miss an update from simply
learn
so without further ado let's get started
with our first topic that is what
exactly is a binary tree
so it is a treated structure in which
each node can have at most two child
nodes these nodes are referred to as
left child node and right child node
next let's discuss about some terms
related to binary tree
first up a node a node consists of data
and a link to its both child nodes
next the root node root node is the
first node of the tree next leaf nodes
these are the nodes which has no child
next parent node apart from the root
node any node which has at least one
child is called as parent to that child
node next up a child node any node with
a parent is called as a child node
next up is the internal node any node
with a child and a parent is called as
an internal node next up is the height
of the binary tree the longest path from
the root to any leaf node is called as
the height of the binary tree
next up is the depth of the binary tree
the depth of the node is the total
number of edges from the root node to
the target node or the
last child node
now let's try to implement the binary
tree in the code editor
as you can see now we are on the code
editor and the code on my screen is an
example for binary tree now here you can
see that we have created a structure for
node followed by that we have a function
where we will print the tree
and this is our main function
now don't worry about the code this
particular code segment will be
available in our description box below
and you can always have access to it and
try to edit and run this code on your
own local system to have a better
learning experience now without further
ado let's try to run this program
quickly and see the output
so there you go the code got
successfully executed and here you can
see the output of this particular binary
tree
now let's get back to the theory part so
as discussed before followed by the
implementation part we will learn about
the properties of a binary tree
now let's discuss the properties of the
binary trees
first up maximum number of nodes at a
level l is 2 to the power l
next up maximum number of nodes in a
binary tree of height h is equals to 2
to the power of h minus 1.
next up minimum possible height in a
binary tree with two nodes is equals to
log of l plus one base two
next up the minimum possible level in a
binary tree with n nodes is equals to
log of l plus 1 base 2.
finally a binary tree with l leaves has
at least
log l base 2 plus 1 levels
now
let's discuss about the different types
of binary trees
first up we have the full binary tree
followed by that we have the complete
binary tree
then we have the perfect binary tree
followed by that we have the balanced
binary tree and lastly the degenerate
binary tree let's discuss about these in
detail first up full binary tree a full
binary tree is a unique tree data
structure in which a node can have
either two children or no child
next a complete binary tree
so a complete binary tree is another
specific binary tree where each node on
all levels except the last level must
have two children and at the lowest
level all leaves should reside possibly
on the left side
the next one is the perfect binary tree
a binary tree is perfect if every node
must have two children and every leaf is
on the same level
the next one is called as the balanced
binary tree
a binary tree is balanced if for each
node the height of the left subtree and
the height of the right subtree varies
at most by just one
at last we have the degenerate binary
tree
a binary tree is said to be degenerate
if every internal node has only one
child
we have now discussed the binary tree
some terms and properties related to
binary trees and types of binary trees
now we will look into the operations
that needs to be performed on the binary
tree so there are basically three types
of operations that can be performed on
binary tree which are traversal
insertion and deletion
so first we'll look into the traversal
operations
there are three different types of
traversal operations possible on binary
tree which are pre-order traversal
in order traversal and finally the post
order traversal
now let's get back into the text editor
mode and try to execute our example
so right now we are on the text editor
and this particular code is for the
traversal operations on our
binary tree and here you can see we have
the structure for node and we have also
the in order function pre-order function
and post order function don't worry
about the code this particular code will
be available in the description box
below and after you have written the
code we have some standard input over
here you can see that we are giving the
number of edges as four and the left
subtree elements are two and one and the
right subtree elements are two and three
and another left subtree elements are
three and five and lastly we have five
and six for another left subtree
now let's try to execute this code
now we have already executed the code
and we also have the output over here
and here you can see we have entered the
number of edges as four and the
traversal is in order traversal which is
one two six five and three and the
pre-order traversal output is two
one three five six and the post order
traversal is one six five three and two
now let's get back to the ppt now we
have the insertion operation
and now let's get back to our text
editor and try to see an example for
insertion operation as well
so on my screen you can see an example
for insertion operation
so here we have the insert function as i
said this particular code will be
available
in the description box below now let's
provide the standard input
so the standard input will be four edges
and we have two and one as the left
subtree and two and three as right
subtree three and five as left subtree
again and
five and six as the left subtree now
let's quickly run this code
and there you go the program got
successfully executed and here we have
the
output
the nodes got inserted and it has
provided an in order traversal that is
one two six five and three
now let's get back to the presentation
and the last type of operation is the
deletion operation let's quickly execute
an example based on deletion operation
as well
now as you can see we are on the text
editor again now here the example is for
deletion operation we have the delete
function over here
now for this particular program we don't
need any standard inputs so just let's
run the program
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and we have the
output over here and in order traversal
before deletion and in order traversal
after the deletion of an element
so the deleted element is element 11.
now with that let's get back to the
presentation mode again so that's how
the element got deleted now we have
reached to the last part of this session
that happens to be the final key
takeaways
so what are the final takeaways
so binary tree is faster at search
operations than other type of tree and
it is easier to find maximum and minimum
elements in the binary tree binary tree
does not allow duplicate values and
graph traversal is done using binary
tree it is used to convert the post
post-fixed expressions into the prefix
expressions so these were the final
takeaways
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on binary trees if you have
any queries regarding the session then
please feel free to ask them away in the
comment section below and our team of
experts will be happy to resolve all
your queries until next time thank you

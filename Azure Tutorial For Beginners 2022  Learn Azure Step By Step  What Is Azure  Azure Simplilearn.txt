Microsoft aure is a growing set of
cloud-based Computing Services offered
to corporations developers government
organizations and anybody else who wants
to build an app or run a business on the
internet without having to install and
manage Hardware or server
software but this much information is
not enough to understand the complete
cycle of its
Concepts and that is what I'm here for
hey everyone welcome to this new video
on simply learn on Azure tutorial for
beginners in this video I'll take you
around crucial Azure services and their
in-depth
Concepts so without doing any further
Ado let's start with the
video but before diving into the Azure
world let's have a quick introduction to
what is cloud computing
so cloud computing is the distribution
of Computing Services VI the internet
including servers storage databases
networking software analytics and
intelligence to provide faster
Innovation more flexible resources and
economies of
scale you usually only pay for the cloud
services you use which helps you cut
cost run your infrastructure more
efficiently and scale as your business
grow
grows so this was all about cloud
computing now let's start with the start
of this video that is
azure first let's understand what is
Microsoft
Azure Microsoft Azure is a growing set
of cloud-based Computing Services
offered to
Corporation developers
government and anybody else who wants to
build an app or run a business on the
internet without having to install and
manage Hardware or server
software in recent years it has eclipsed
both windows and office in terms of
sales making it Microsoft fastest
growing business
sector the Azure platform is designed to
assist organizations in overcoming
obstacles and achieving their objectives
it supports a wide range of Industries
including e-commerce finance and a
number of
organization and it is open-source
compatible
this gives consumers the freedom to use
whatever tools and Technologies they
want now coming to how asure Works
customers who subscribe to Asar get
access to all of the services available
through the Azure
interface these Services allow
subscribers to create cloud-based
resources such as virtual machines and
databases asure comes with five
different customer support Sol solutions
from Microsoft basic developer standard
professional direct and
Premier the scope and cost of these
customer assistance programs vary all
asure accounts get basic assistance for
free however Microsoft charges a premium
for the other Support options developer
support is $29 per month $100 per month
for standard assistants and $1,000 per
month for professional directs bought
Microsoft does not provide pricing
information for Premier
support now that we have covered the
basics of Microsoft Azure let's dive
down and explore the services offered by
Azure well there are multiple services
offered by Azure like machine learning
analytics containers compute databases
developer
tools devox hybrid and multicloud
identity
integration Internet of Things
management media migration mobile
networking Security Storage web and
virtual
desktop but among these we will be
discussing only a few which are widely
used by organizations and
individuals around the world and we will
be vividly discussing these features in
depth and these service are compute
containers databases identity security
networking and
storage now let's start with the first
one that
is
compute asure compute is a service that
allows you to run cloud-based
applications on
demand this CPUs memory networking and
operating systems are among the
Computing resources IT supplies and the
resources are on demand and can be
accessed in minutes or even seconds you
only pay for what you use and for how
long you use it aure offers a variety of
computing solutions for development and
testing application deployment and data
center
expansion Linux Windows Server SQL
Server orle IBM and sap are all
supported by the server
the following are some of the most
well-known Services Azure virtual
machines virtual machine skill sets
Azure container instances Azure app
service and Azure functions are also
serverless
Computing now let's discuss each of this
one by
one first is azure virtual
machines virtual machines are
software-based computer
simulations a virtual processor memory
storage and networking resources are
among the resources
available virtual machines or VMS run on
operating system and allow you to
install and run software much like a
regular computer you can use and operate
the virtual machine as if you were
sitting in front of it by utilizing a
remote desktop
client as for virtual machines allow you
to construct and operate virtual
machines in the cloud infrastructure as
a service is provided through virtual
machines and they can be used in a
variety of ways virtual machines are an
excellent solution when you need
complete control over an operating
system and its surroundings all of the
software running on the VM can be
customized just as on a real
machine also when you're running custom
software or hosting Arrangements this
capability comes in handy
now coming on to the next one that is
virtual machine scale sets scale sets
are an Asher computer resource that may
be used to deploy and manage a group of
identical virtual
machines virtual machine scill sets are
meant to provide real Auto scale when
all VMS are set up the
same virtual machines do not need to be
pre-provisioned as a result developing
large scale services for big Computing
big data and containerized workloads is
easy more VM instances can be added as
demand grows VM instances can be
withdrawn when demand decreases the
procedure might be human automated or a
hybrid of the
two now moving on to the next one that
is azure container
instances container instances are Azure
compute resources for managing and
deploying container ERS containers are
virtualized application environments
that are lightweight they're buil to be
dynamically formed scaled and stop on a
single host machine you can run many
instances of a containerized
application then comes Azure app
Services you can create deploy and scale
Enterprise grade web mobile and API apps
on any platform with Azure app services
while employing a fully managed platform
to handle infrastructure maintenance you
can meet stringent performance
scalability security and compliance
requirements a platform as a service
solution is app
service and following that we have as
job
functions when you simply care about the
code that runs your service and not the
underlying platform or infrastructure
functions are great they're frequently
used when you need to respond to an
event typically via R request a timer or
a message from another Azure service and
the job can be accomplished rapidly in
seconds or
less now that we have completed all the
services offered by compute let's
proceed to the next one that is
containers containers are a type of
virtualization system you can run
several containers on a single phys
physical or virtual host in the same way
that you can run numerous virtual
machines on a single physical
host unlike virtual machines you don't
have control over a container's
operating system containers are
lightweight and designed to be built
scaled out and stopped dynamically
whereas virtual machines appear to be
instance of an operating system that you
can connect to an
administer containers are built to help
you to react to changes on the go
containers allow you to swiftly resume
in the event of a crash of Hardware
failure Docker is one of the most
popular container engines and Azure
supports it containers offer these
particular
service container instances aure
container services and container
registry container instances are the
quickest and easiest method to operate a
container in the ashure without needing
to manage virtual machines or use any
extra Services it's a pass service that
lets you upload your containers and have
them run for
you moving on to the next one are Asha
container
services Asha container services or Asha
kubernetes Services allows users to
manage deploy and control operations of
kubernetes
container orchestration is a term used
to describe the process of automating
managing and interacting with a large
number of
containers a your kubernetes service is
a comprehensive container orchestration
service for distributed architectures
and high volumes of
containers and then comes container
registry a container registry is used to
ease container development by easing
store storage and management of
container
images now that we have covered
containers and their services offered
let's move on to the next Asher service
that is
databases Asher database is a fully
managed platform as a service database
engine that automates the majority of
database management tasks such as
updating patching backups and
monitoring my Microsoft has released a
manage instance aimed at on premises
clients so if we have any SQL databases
on premises that we want to migrate to
Azure without any complex configuration
or
ambiguity we can use manage instances
the most prominent Services Under
database service are as your Cosmos DB
as your SQL database and asure postre
SQL now coming to the Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is a multimodel globally
distributed database
service you may increase throughput and
storage across any number of aure
locations around the world in an elastic
and independent man you can use any way
of several common apis to get single
digigit millisecond data access
throughput latency availability and
consistency assurances are all covered
by asure Cosmos DB service level
agreements now Azure Cosmos DB enables
schema less data allowing you to create
extremely responsive and always on apps
that can handle constantly changing data
this functionality can be used to store
data that has been updated and
maintained by users all around the
world the next comes aure SQL
database aure SQL database is is a
relational database based on the
Microsoft SQL Server database engines
most recent stable
version SQL database is a fast
dependable well-managed and secure
database you may use it to create data
driven applications and websites in your
preferred programming language without
having to worry about
infrastructure so SQL databases pass
capabilities allows you to concentrate
on the domain specific database
Administration
and optimization task that are vital to
your
business SQL database is a fully managed
service with high availability backups
and other typical maintenance features
built in Microsoft is in charge of SQL
and operating system code changes you
don't have to worry about the
infrastructure coming to the next one
the aure post three
SQL now aure database posty
SQL is a cloud-based relational database
solution the server software is based on
the open- source posty SQL database
engines
Community when you use Asha database for
a postc SQL your experience with tools
and knowledge comes in handy more
however it has various benefits like in
comparison to on premisis resources
there is built in high availability to
ensure that your apps are always online
no additional configuration replication
or cost is
necessary pricing is straightforward and
adaptable you can expect consistent
performance thanks to a pricing TR tire
that includes software patching
automatic backups monitoring and
security within seconds scale up or down
as needed to ensure that your service
adapts to usage you can draw computation
and storage
independently as
needed automatic backups can be
customized and restored to a specific
point in time for up to 35 days and
Enterprise level security to safeguard
sensitive data and Transit and at rest
this production includes data encryption
on disk as well as SSL encryption for
Cent server
communication now we have covered one
more crucial service offered by azure
now let's move ahead and explore another
service that is security and
identity these two services are
integrated so we will be discussing them
together identity management in specific
is a process of authenticating first and
then authorizing using security
principles and it involves controlling
information about those principal
identities it provides these important
Services Azure security Center Key and
very important aspect of azure service
that is azure active
directory Azure security Center first
Azure security Center is a collection of
tools for monitoring and managing the
security of virtual machines and other
cloud computing resources in Microsoft's
public
Cloud the Azure security Center is
access through the ashure management
interface by
administrators they may find a number of
security tools in the security Center to
help them prevent identify and respond
to possible security risk to the aure
deployment to use the security Center
organizations must have an aure
subscription next is ashure
keyal ashure keyal is a cloud ser Serv
for storing and accessing secrets in a
secure manner anything you want to
restrict access to such as API Keys
passwords certificates or cryptographic
Keys is a secret Vols a manage and
Hardware security module pools are two
types of containers supported by the key
service software as well as HSM backed
Keys Secrets and certificates can be
stored in WS only EDM back keys are
supported by man
HSM
pools coming to the next one is asure
active
directory aure active directory or aure
ad is a cloud-based identity and access
management service from Microsoft that
allows your employees to sign in and
access resources such as Microsoft 365
the Azure portal and thousands of other
SAS apps internal resources such as apps
on your company's in inet and network as
well as any Cloud apps built by your
company as ad is required for sign in
and identity protection in Microsoft
online business such as Microsoft 365
and
Azure if you sign up for any Microsoft
online businesses you'll be given access
to ashr ad which includes all of the
free
services now we covered one more as your
service let's move on to the next
service which is
networking now Azure provides the
scalability performance High
availability and Enterprise grade
security you need to satisfy your most
extreme workloads requirements with more
than 1 lakh 65,000 M of private fibers
across 60 plus regions and 170 Plus
network poops around the
world customers will have consistent low
latency experience thanks to service and
integrate smoothly across on premises
multicloud and Edge
locations so when you use as your
networking Network as a service you can
concentrate on delivering your
application
logic Network Watcher Express root
monitor ashure monitor or
vnet terminal access point are all asure
networking services that can be used to
monitor your network resources
so the first one we will talk about are
virtual
Network asual virtual networks allow
aure services such as virtual machines
web apps and databases to connect with
one another with internet users and with
on promises client
computers an Asher network is a
collection of resources that connects
other Asher resources isolation and
segment
ation internet communications
communicate among asual resources
communicating with on promises
resources route Network traffic filter
Network traffic and connect virtual
networks are some of the code networking
features provided by Asha virtual
networks next we will talk about VPN
Gateway a virtual Network Gateway or VPN
Gateway is a form of the virtual Network
Gateway as
your instances are install an Azure
virtual Network instances and provide
connectivity for services such as a
sight tosite connection connects on
premisis data centers to Virtual
networks a PO to site link connects
individual devices to Virtual networks
and a network to network connection
connects virtual networks to other
virtual Network
works so now moving on in Express
rout with the support of a connectivity
provider express route allows you to
expand your on promises networks into
the Microsoft cloud over a private
connection you can connect to Microsoft
cloud services such as Microsoft Azure
and Microsoft 365 using express route
and any to any ipvpn network a point too
ethernet Network or a virtual cross
connection through a connectivity
provider at a collocation facility can
all be used for
connectivity so Express root connections
are not made through a public network as
a result Express root connections
provide more reliability quicker speeds
constant latencies and higher security
than traditional internet connections
now we have reached the last service
offered by Asher that we will
discuss
storage Microsoft aure storage platform
is a cloud storage technology designed
for current data storage
scenarios a massive scalable object
stored for data object desk storage for
Asher virtual machines a file system
service for the cloud a messaging store
for Reliable Communications and a nosql
store at all available through core
storage
Services the services offered by are as
your blob storage as your table storage
as your Q storage and aszure file
storage so the first one is azure blob
storage blob storage is a Microsoft
Azure service for storing binary big
objects made up of unstructured material
like text photos and videos and as well
as Associated
metadata blob storage objects can be
accessed through HTTP or https from
anywhere in the globe by users or
clients
applications blob storage objects can be
accessed using the Azure storage rest
API Azure power cell and Azure CLI or a
client library for Azure
storage coming to the next one is azure
table
storage large volume voles of structured
data are stored in Azure table storage
the service is a nosql data store that
takes request from both inside and
outside the Azure
Cloud now Azure tables are great for
storing non- relational structured data
table storage can be used to store and
query large amount of structured non-
relational data and it will scale as
demand
grows moving on to the next one that is
as aure Q
storage aure Q storage is a service that
allows you to store massive amounts of
data authenticated HTTP or https call
allow you access the messages from
anywhere in the world a q message can
have a maximum size of 64 KB a q can
hold millions of messages up to the
storage of account's overall capacity
limit cues are widely used to build a
backlog of work for asynchronous
processing now coming to the last one is
azure file
storage Azure files provides fully
managed cloud files that can be accessed
via the industry standard server message
blog or network file system
protocols cloud and on premisis
deployments can both Mount as your files
file shares at the same time Windows
Linux and Mac OS clients can access SMB
Azure file shares clients running Linux
or Mac OS can access NFS Azure file
shares additionally using aure file
synchronization SMB Azure file shares
can be cached on Windows servers for
Rapid access near where the data is
used so now that we have covered all of
the important services offered by AAR
and the
functionality let's dive deeper into the
into the concept and look into how Azure
is better than other Cloud
platforms so first is Microsoft Azure
PASS gives developers the environment
tools and building blocks they need to
create and deploy new cloud services
quickly it also provides the critical
devops linkages required for monitoring
maintaining and fine-tuning such apps m
roft handles much of the infrastructure
management behind the scenes with Azure
pass as a result Azure deployment allows
for a singular emphasis on
Innovations second is the compatibility
of aure with one of the most beneficial
feature of
asure and that is the net programming
language which gives Microsoft a
significant advantage over AWS and the
rest of the competition
aure was designed and tuned to work
seamlessly with both old and new apps
built on the platform framework for net
programming now aure was built using the
security development cite which is a
leading Assurance process in the
industry it has security at its core
ensuring that private data and services
are kept secure and protected while on
Azure cloud
fourth is on ASO hybrid apps like can be
created that take advantage of resources
in data centers at the service providers
end or within aure itself to increase
usability and speed Asha now offers a
greater selection of hybrid connections
such as virtual private networks caches
content delivery networks and express
rout connections
fifth is if a company already utilizes
Microsoft software it is likely to be
covered by Microsoft Enterprise
agreement it is eligible to discounts on
Microsoft software because Microsoft
frequently modifies their agreements to
reduce Azure pricing as a result of the
Enterprise agreement businesses can
often get large discounts for adopting
Azure let's have a quick demo for Azure
services for the better
understanding so in this demo we will
first create our Resource Group and an
SQL database for it and a server
also so first you need to log in in your
Microsoft as your
account and then click here and go to
Resource
groups click on create
button so for subscription we will have
a free trial option
and uh give it a name according to our
requirement like for now I'm giving it
uh as
your
demo
simply and the region according to your
uh area like where you want to deploy
your apps where you that you will be
publishing here and click on review plus
create here you will get all the
information that you need to review that
all the information here are correct or
not and then click on create
button it will take a few
seconds now you can see this
notification that your resource Group is
created and here you can see that uh
your the name of your resource Group the
subscription and the
location so now what what we need to do
is we will create a SQL database for it
here you can see all the
details so to create our SQL database uh
we will first need to create a web app
so where we need to go
is we will go to app services
and here we will click on create
button and again we need to give it a
first we need to select our Resource
Group so we will click on the resource
Group we just
created and we will uh give it a
name so here uh I'm giving it as
your demo
simply web app and click on code so that
uh while publishing we can upload our
code and runtime stack we can uh select
the language we have created our
application
in again the
reion and click on review plus create so
here you can just review all the details
you just uh
mentioned it's taking a
while yeah so here you can see
subscription Resource Group which you
just created name you gave and uh the
publishing runtime
stack now all you need to do is click on
create you can see it's initializing
deployment
uh you need to be very careful with the
region because sometimes it may create
problem while
deploying you can see deployment is in
progress
now you can see your deployment is
completed
so you just need to go to
resources coming back to the page you
can see uh the name of your application
you just
created now as we are done with the web
app uh now we need to create our uh SQL
database so coming to the SQL database
page we will click on create
button again the subscription we have to
give free trial and the resource Group
we just created because that's what
where we are publishing our web
application and that's where we need to
create uh attach our datab base
with so now we need to give a name to
our database so here I'm
giving so I'm giving it as your demo SQL
DB and uh here you can see that we don't
have any items to select as a server so
we will click on create
new here we will create a server for our
SQL database and uh give it a
name so I'm giving it a
name this
is sorry
I'm giving it a name as your simply
server as you can see it's already taken
so I need to change it so let's take as
your demo
server yeah so now we are done with the
name again for location we need to
mention the region so here you can see
I've selected
now
coming here we have to enter our admin
login so here I'm giving my
organizations
name I need to give it a
password then confirm password
and click on
okay so here you can
see that database name has already been
attached to it the database we just
created
for elastic pool we will go for no
option only and uh then again we will
click on review plus
create so here you can see all of the
information that you just
mentioned whatever privileges you will
have with your SQL database and click on
create
you can see uh deployment has been
initialized it's going to take a
while you can see the
status constantly and track
them here you can see deployment is in
progress and in a while you will see the
name being flashed over here
now you can see your deployment is
completed and in deployment details you
can see your database being created and
the demo server you just
created now going back to your resource
Group the one we created at first
clicking on the
name we can see all the tasks we just
did like creating a web app C creating a
database for it and also a server for
your
database now all you need to do is
publish your uh application that you
created for yourself and deploy it over
here so this is all in our demo I hope
you liked it and learned something from
it and see you in the next
tutorial well this was all about
Microsoft ashure and its revolving
Concepts I hope you find this video

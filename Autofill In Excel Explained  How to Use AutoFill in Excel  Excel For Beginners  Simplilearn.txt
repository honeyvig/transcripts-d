hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel in this session we will
be learning AutoFill in Excel but before
we begin let me tell you guys that we
have daily updates on multiple
Technologies so if you're a tech gig in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply Lear so without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is AutoFill in
Excel now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from 1
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be doing it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one 2 and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as long as you drag this logo
or that ending part where you have a
small square box that will fill all the
numbers until where you have tracked so
that's how autofill works and you might
be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that cell and the result
is it'll copy the same number all the
time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the next type so let
us imagine now the next type of series
you want to add is weeks in a day right
so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of week days
using autofill and Excel as well so drag
that cell and it will give you all the
days or week days in a week now let's
try
January and this will will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut TOA right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current year
right it will now give you all the dates
of that current month or until the end
of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January so how can
you do that it's simple all you need to
do is select the cell go to the fill
option select series and here select
column wise since you w the dates and
columns and here in the type select date
date unit should be weekday and the stop
value should be the next month right
since your manager asked for the week
days of January so your stop value will
be the 1st of February press okay and
there you go so since the 1st of January
is Friday it's selected over here and
the rest to Saturday and Sunday are
eliminated similarly we have all the
dates here of working days only so
that's how you use AutoFill in Excel and

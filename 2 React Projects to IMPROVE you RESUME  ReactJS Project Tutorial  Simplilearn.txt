hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn
this video on react.js helps you build
two fun applications using the library
as you all know react is a widely used
javascript library to build user
interfaces for applications
this video will make you realize why it
is adopted so widely so first we'll
build a calculator app and then we'll
move on to building a spotify clone
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
now i'm sure you're excited to build
these apps so let's begin
this time we're going to introduce you
another very interesting project using
this javascript html css
so called calculator application so
let's get started let me try to delete
first those files which we really do not
need it now
we delete this all
yeah now i will be creating a new folder
now and give the name called
calculator app
and in this calculator app once again we
need some new files which is called
index
dot html
and we also need one more that is called
app.css
and another one that is app dot js
so these three files required now first
of all i would start with
index.html file where we'll be creating
a template of my code
now
let me go and create this template and
here
i have a god body with me
let's start with the
first
tag here that is called h1
and this h1 we are giving the name
called calculator
calculator app so that will be my h1
heading
after that we'll start working with the
div tag
now within this div
i would have to create lot many classes
i may not have lot many css classes but
we can give some classes here so we can
say class equal to
container
okay so within this div tag we're going
to create a table now because i want to
organize it
so i'm starting with the table within
this table
tr tag
and within this tr tag i need a td
now in this td i need few things call
call
span
equal to 3
another value
and here
i want to offer the text box
input type equal to
text
okay input up to text id equal to give
the name called result
that will be the final outcome while
pressing all the different buttons id
equal to result and
class equal to
screen remember i haven't created those
css classes but but we're giving some
names but later on we can utilize it
while creating those css classes
table data is getting closed let's get
started with another td
now insert this td we need another text
box
input type equal to
text
and
here in this input text sorry i would
like to better say button because i'll
be having
buttons
okay
input i'm equal to
button
value
equal to
c
and
on click
equal to i may not have any function
right now but yes i can create
a function but let me give some domain
name here
i'm saying clear
screen
okay so that will be the function will
get called
and after that class
equal to clear
yeah so this is my
button tag
after this the td tag is getting closed
after the td tag the table row is also
getting closed after the table row
which is getting close we're going to
start working with another table row
okay and in this table row i'm going to
create one more td
so let's go ahead and create
another td here
and inside this td i'll be having
another projector we get created
so i'll just say
this is my another button now input
button value equal to
one or click equal to i'll be calling
another function called display
okay
and inside this we're giving the value
call one
okay and class equal to member
plus equal to
number
and here after the tettering tag is
getting closed
okay now you have to start another td
tag here
okay like that we have to keep on
creating the multiple buttons so let me
copy
and paste another table data
now here
again value equal to 2 on click product
display
give the value call 2
and class equal to what
number
like that i'll keep on creating multiple
buttons but first check how it actually
looks like
now i can see the buttons like in c one
two three but yes i'm gonna create few
more buttons one after another
okay so i'll go here
and create few more buttons so this is
where the table data is getting closed
okay i'll copy this
and paste it again
how to create
the button
like in 3 4 something like that
so after this two we're giving the value
called three
here
i'll give the value call three
so val equal to two well equal to three
display three
and then afterwards
just giving the value call
forward slash
and here also we're gonna keep the value
from
forward slash
and here class equal to
operator
operator
after that
you have to do the value call 4
and then followed by 567
so here we give 4.
four
five
five
six
six
after six we're giving call minus
[Music]
okay once again it will be what type of
operator
operator okay after this
minus we'll be talking about call 7
then we have to have 8.
okay nine
okay after that we're giving for plus
and
display
plus plus equal to operator
operator okay so here
you can see the table data is getting
closed and here the table is also
getting closed
and after this table row we can start
working with
another table here
and
after this table row we can start
working with again
td let me have this
again
inside this i'll be giving the option
called decimal which is value equal to
dot and here we get the value called
decimal
okay
now display zero
so after giving this dot basically take
what the value
zero which we haven't put now
we'll be talking about value called zero
so here
the decimal value we have given it td is
getting close let me have another one
zero
zero
so like that we have to keep this now
after that
we'll be once again
taking this and this time rather than
giving this zero
we'll be using this call as a button
and value equal to equal
or click equal to
solve
okay and then this soft will not be
passing anything
it like a normal function
and plus equal to
equal
okay
so
table data is getting closed
so we will be using another table data
now
so here it will be the button only
okay we will be using
well equal to
multiplication
display
plastic and here we'll be using operator
okay
so table data is getting close table
room is getting close table is also
getting closed here
okay so your dev tag is also getting
closed here
okay that's it
okay so that's the only thing which we
wanted to make let me try to refresh and
check
awesome
so we have got
all those
necessary calculator behavior
which uh
we wanted to
reveal
okay
now our next statement will be once
we're giving this c then we have a call
of one two three
and then forward slash
followed by
four five six will come down
okay so let me check whether we have
used six or not
okay so we haven't used six so let me
check here
four five six
so let me go back here
four five six let me copy this
and paste it later on
before
minus
six
equal to
number
okay so we're almost set now
so we are having this uh
look and feel
in this way giving one two three four
five six and after this we have a call
minus and then plus related behavior so
we are all set now and after that we'll
be basically applying the css as well as
the javascript look towards my code okay
thank you
well everybody we are all good to go now
but i just want to first check whether
my
uh this outlook is looking properly or
not see what my expectation is after one
two three forward slash i really want to
bring 456 to the next and then seven
eight nine and again forward still but i
can think this is absolutely unorganized
so after this when we say
this uh forward slash which we have used
after hyphen
okay your tt is getting closed here
okay so here the tr i also want to close
here
okay and after this tr i also want to
start
another tr here
okay so that i can put them into the
another level now
so under this tr i can use this td now
so after this minus
after four five six
minus
once again i would like to start
another table over here
okay so that it let's go to the next row
so here
after td
we're closing this dr and starting
another tier
okay we're starting another tier after
that we talk about 789
okay plus
see here talking about 789 plus here the
table is getting close and it is
starting right now like this
see that looks better now
okay but still few more things which i
would like to make it even more
organized but that's not a problem we
will do it later on
okay because you can see eight is
missing right now
so here
seven we copy this
equal to eight
eight
yeah that looks better now so now they
are basically completely organized so
the moment i expect my application
so we have a call
dot here then zero then equal to and
then multiplication
okay so it looks
better now
now i just would like to perform the
overall look and feel
so i need to go ahead and use what css
because without css i really can't
utilize this in a proper way so i have
to start working with a css friend now
in css front how to start first we will
go back to my code and here in my css we
will start working with
font family but before font fabric i
would like to start with the body part
now
body
background color i'm using
that looks nice
okay so
i will be using this app.css
in my html to see the look how it is
been appeared right now so in my
index.html file
on the top under my head section
link
start sheet
okay now see it looks better now
going forward
in my css
we want to use
some h1 correct tool so here
we would like to use the h1
text align
center
color
white
margin top
margin top we'd like to use 50 pixels
this is for h1 let's check
perfect so it is now coming in between
next statement will be called screen so
we say dot
screen
so in this screen we use the background
color
sorry
border solid
black and two pixels
after that color
white
font size
medium
next width
we're using this
100
then we talk about cursor
what are the default cursor is
okay then padding
we would like to say 10 pixels
and then
margin
save auto
then margin bottom
that i'll be using 10 pixels
so in the proper alignment
okay
look
that's how exactly we want that's for
the screen where the exact outcome will
be visible to me
and rest of the details we'll be showing
you one by one and now we'll be talking
about call input
okay
input
type
equal to button
for input type equal to
button
okay
input
of type
over the
overrun button i say
background color
change to what
right or else i can say
let's walk
okay
and
when the button is active
what i want
let me copy
like this
you can see now how it is basically
looking like it
okay active the color will be like this
okay i'll be talking about color
operators
operator should behave different so i'm
saying dot
operator
in this operator we are saying
background color
background color orange
okay that paddy
want five pixels
okay then i want color
that should be black
after this i'm using call border
sorry
that border
i'm using this called solid
and then black
and
then height
height is 40 pixels
then cursor
it has to be pointed
okay that's it let's check
perfect so they shall turn back to what
to your
orange color
and
you can see the moment you take macros
on the returns to
white perfect and now those were type
number i also want to change them
so for number
for number i want to save the same
option
padding i want 5 pixels
then i need height
of type 40 pixels
then i say color
it looks i want to say called black
then border
border i want solid
black into excess solid
black
two pixels
then width
i would say point width 700
let's check
awesome so they looks nice
now we're left few
other type of options like in dot and
equal to
okay that i'm talking about called
decimal
decimal i need to have a different
options with me
okay so
let me try to copy this
paste it and i say for
does it
so for decimal background color will be
light blue
padding five pixels color black border
solid
okay black two pixels with hundred
percent height forty pixels five cursor
pointer
perfect
okay looks nice but i have changed the
color to light blue
now
i talk about
clear
okay
now come back
and
say clear
okay in this color
background color is i'm changed to light
salmon
light salmon
padding 5 pixels color black
border
height 40 pixels
fine so cursor
pointer
file margin
auto and margin bottom
merging bottom differences
let's check
perfect not looks beautiful
okay
now here after giving these details
we're talking about call equal part dot
equal
so for dot equal also i'm just copying
the same
so we recall
background color adding color
just change to
light green
light green
and
after this
since it is a equal so we say padding
five pixels is okay color black fine
border fine with hundred percent high 40
pixels
color and cursor pointers just i don't
need to
it's for dot equal and i want
for container
container
in this container width i want 40
percent
red 40 percent background color white
okay
now here
writing is 15 pixels
so display block
so first of all you call width
you see
display block
which we're taking margin
okay in margin basic pixels
auto
okay now align cells
go to
center
okay border radius
border radius let's just say 10 pixels
okay now using box shadow
box shadow 5 pixels
and padding
so these are details
okay
we have it background color we are
taking it now
align cell
display block border radius padding
and then
writing 15 pixels we've given audi i
don't need to give it
again okay fine
box shadow let's try
awesome so it's looking beautiful now
okay so this is where exactly my
application
works like that
and table when we talk about
everything with
100
okay
that's it
super
so it's now giving me the proper look of
how
my application should be here i can just
see about the container what we have
done
with 40 we are taking background color
let's bring it below
then align cell
display block
okay margin
okay
and border radius
and uh
fine so i think we're all good now
so
that's it so we'll try and implement the
javascript part well everyone so our css
file is ready our html is ready it's
time to just
go ahead and talk about my
final question that is called gs part
where i want to basically perform some
calculators
now here i just say function
display
function display which takes
val as in parameter and say
document dot
get element by id
here i'm saying
result
okay dot
value
okay
plus
equal to
whatever we are adding it just basically
try to apply
calculation on the top of that
okay there is a function
after that we have another functions
available here called function solved
here in the solve
we just use the value called let x equal
to
document dot get element by id
result
okay
dot
value sorry
dot
value
okay and say
let
y
equal to perform the calculations for
the will be using one function called
eval
and type
axis and parameter
now the next statement will be again
document.
get it runway id
result
dot
value equal to
y
okay
now
later on
i'll write to use another function here
function
clear screen
and here we say
document.
get it in my id
here we say
result
dot
value
equal to
like that
so clear screen
solve
and
display three functions are associated
with me and these three functions
are the part of this javascript file
which i'll be calling it
at the end before
the water tag get closed so here
that's it okay let's try to execute now
here
two you can see the values
i will say plus
six
equal to eight absolutely i say c is
clear the screen
six
divided
by 2
equal to 3 awesome so friends your
calculator application is ready
congratulations to all so it is a very
simplest form which we have developed
this is your html which is a template
for you this is the css which is your
complete
the area of like how the look and feel
will look like in of this template
beautification and here last year for js
which is smaller logic but really
meaningful
okay if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
let's start with creating a simple demo
on react.js and we are going to create a
simple application
that will connect to an online music
streaming service called spotify and we
will call our application music app so
let's get started
the first step is to first get the
node.js platform and server installed to
do that let me go to google and let's
just type node.js
and here is the website nodejs.org
there are two versions available the lts
which is the stable version and the
current we'll prefer the stable so we'll
click on that and you can see we have an
option which is called save file the
moment this file is saved to the disk we
just need to double click on it and keep
clicking on the next button to get it
installed on our system and we also have
a documentation available here so which
explains most of the features of the
node platform and there are binaries
available for different os's mac windows
etc so you can select the right witness
32-bit 64-bit and the right os
and then go ahead and download the
specific
version that suits
your platform and you can see here that
there are different there are also help
files available that will allow you to
go through the installation documents
for node.js installation on linux etc so
to start with uh i'm opening up the
command prompt and here is where we're
going to call the node package manager
using the node package manager which is
pre-installed with your standard
installation we will initialize our
react application so we would say react
dash app and
we want to now go and create an
application called music app in this
folder so as a prerequisite for the demo
all we need to do is install node.js
from node.js.org the official website
just download it and install it and
that's when you open the command prompt
you fire npm which stands for node
package manager init for initialize
react dash app is a standard keyword to
initialize and create a skeletal
structure of a react.js application and
the name of the app is music app so
we'll hit enter we'll give this some
time and you can see it's
started downloading the core
react.js libraries and it is attempting
to create
our application so it's installing all
the prerequisite packages and scripts
that are required initialize and create
a new react.js application called music
app now once this application is created
all we would require is an online editor
so you could use an offline or an
on-premise editor as well so any editor
of your choice it could be atom or
sublime text or webstorm and
for this demo we're going to use visual
studio code which is
a free editor available by microsoft and
you can just google for visual studio
code again uh this is not visual studio
professional edition etc that we use for
building our c-sharp or mbc-based
applications this is a lightweight
editor for building javascript based
footstep full applications so so while
this installs let's go and take a look
at uh visual studio code so this is the
visual studio code editor and this is
the editor that we've
installed directly downloaded from
visualstudiocode.com and installed it
and all we need to do is open up this
folder that would be created with all
the prerequisite files in it we just say
file open folder and we would open that
folder within our visual studio code
editor so we'll give it a while until
that application gets generated and once
it's created we will again implement the
component based design and architecture
and the data flow between the components
and we'll also look at connecting to a
live data source which is a json set of
characters that we would consume which
is a restful service
the set of music tracks
exposed as a restful api endpoint by
spotify which is a premium streaming
service we will connect to that and we
will look at
accessing some of the music tracks on
that website okay so we've got uh the
application created here so let's
minimize this and
we'll open up our editor all we've got
to say is file and open folder and
let me go to the react.js demo folder so
this is the music app that got created
and that's exactly what we're going to
open up here so we'll navigate to that
folder it's called music app we'll
select it
and have it opened in our application so
you can see here we've got a note
modules folder this has all of the
pre-installed packages that make up the
react.js library we've got a folder
called public which will have the
index.html file that's the root file
that will launch so this is the single
page application that we typically
create
in a react you have a single page which
on which we're going to load multiple
components so that's the index.html and
then we could go and create
a folder structure
currently if i open the source folder we
can see a single app.js file and that
basically is
the file that has uh the source code in
javascript for a single component which
we are interested in adding on to our
page as of now so we just have one
component which is the default root
component that's the app component and
it has its corresponding css file
and then we've got
the a public folder with the index.html
file which is going to be
the root html file that launches when we
run our application so let's uh go right
up here and let's add
a link to an additional file so i'm
going to link to another style sheet
okay so we'd say relationship is equal
to stylesheet and the type is going to
be text
and css
and
we will reference a file called
reset dot css and this is a file that we
look at
adding up later on it doesn't exist at
this point in time so we will connect
this and that's purely for styling
purposes
so that we can have
all of our css styles defined there next
thing i'll right click on the public
folder we'll create a new file we'll
name this file as reset
dot css so that's going to be the css
file that will have all of the css uh
styling that we're going to apply and
i'm going to use a ready code snippet uh
for the css code so let me just uh okay
so i'll all i'll do is i'll just go and
pick up
a ready css file that i can just go and
use
if you look here i have a set of
css files that are created that we're
just going to use
within our application and
and that will avoid us spending a lot of
time on the styling so that we can focus
on our core concepts uh which is
actually learning how component based
architecture works and how do we set up
components and have data communication
between them in react so uh here is a
file called uh reset.css
let me just fire up
notepad and i'll just open up this file
copy up the text here and i'm going to
just paste it within
my reset.css and if you look at the code
uh very simple it's all about
styling so we've got uh article aside
etc all html5 tags set up as display
block so they take up the entire width
of the page we've got some padding
margin and font size etc defined we've
removed list styling for the unordered
and ordered list specifying the line
height for the body tag so basically uh
just styling up tables and so nothing
nothing to do with react here it's just
about simple uh css that we've added up
uh and now we need to actually go in and
dive into create creation of the
components that we need so let's right
click on the source folder so i'll
select the source folder we'll right
click there and that's where we're going
to create a new folder which is called
components okay so this is the
components folder now that's going to
hold
all of the components within it
within the components folder let me
create
another new folder and i'm going to call
it app and this is exactly how we are
expected to structure all of the code
that we have now i already have a css
and app.js which are the root components
that were added by default and all i'm
going to do is i'm going to move them
within this folder called app okay so
there's a proper segregation of
responsibility and
all of the code that
deals with a particular component is all
added into respective folders and this
really improves the maintainability of
the application uh going forward now we
need some images and i'm just going to
make use of some
set of images that i've downloaded from
the web and
here are the set of images that i have
so i'm just going to copy all of them
and we'll come to our music app and
we'll go into the components and app
folder and that's where we're going to
add all of the files and you've seen all
of those image files getting added so
these are just icons and images we're
going to use for our music tracks inside
our application now
let's move to the app.css file and
this is where we've actually got uh
so the app.css file is the file that's
going to style up
the
all of the style rules that we've added
into the root app component and
this is what we'll have to revamp so
i'll just get rid of this code and
we'll probably add something for the
body tag the html tag and the root
element let me say hash root and let's
set the height to a hundred percent
coming to all of the html across the
page we'll give it a font size of 10
pixels
and
the h1 elements
let me give it a padding of
0.77 and 0 let's set
a background color give it a background
color and just select
some random color here that can be
applied then we'll set up the text
alignment which is going to be the
center of the page we'll set up the font
family the font family is
and this is part of
sans serif what else do we add let's add
up the font size
1.88 and also the color so again uh
these are standard uh html and css
elements so uh nothing really that
has to be done that is specific to react
here so again we are bringing in the
highlight class so there is a class
called highlight that we will create
later in the uh html view of this
component and we will set this to a red
rgb component so combination of 46 113
and 238 okay so that's uh pretty much
done let's move on and also add up for
the anchor tag let's add up some text
decoration and set it to none so that
the anchor tags don't come up with those
underlines and of course we'll provide a
color of hash okay so a white color
there now coming to the h2 element for
the h2 element let's have font family
and again i'm going to use
so i'm going to use
the font family that we defined here
bracket and we change this to probably
1.55
okay now coming to the app tag uh let me
just save this and create a copy of it
uh there was some content that
i did delete and
i can simply go and make use of it so
i've just undone all of the deletion so
this is uh something that i can't uh if
i can use something i can just probably
use it from the tag below so let me
start with the height here and let's say
the height of the header is hundred
percent of the app sorry not header
padding 0 17
10
17
the background and i'm going to change
that to background url so the background
url or let's say the background image
will have a url property okay and that
url is going to be dot slash pg1 dot
jpeg so that's the image that we've
added some in the previous step let's
also add
background size so we'll add background
size and set it to cover i also need a
background position set it to center
let's have background repeat which is
set to
no repeat so that we don't have the
image
in a grid format uh and then i would
need this a bit of it let's take up the
font family we'll maintain the same font
family let's use font weight the font
weight is going to be 500 and the color
is going to be hash
so that's a white color then we come to
dot app dot playlist so that's going to
be
another class that we are going to use
dot but app dash playlist is what we
we're going to name it and
let me say that the display should be
flex
flexible display and we will justify the
content to leave spaces
in between all right so that
finishes that bit and now uh let's write
up a media query for the responsiveness
of this page so this is
media for only screen and max width is
going to be one zero two zero pixels
okay and the class name that we'll
provide later is obviously app playlist
so for this screen size we would align
all the items
to the center and we change the flex
direction okay so we seem to be good
with
the css for the app as of now and that's
the app.css
that we created let me save everything
okay let's check uh
for any kind of uh
additional so all three of errors no
errors now things are good in the app
css and it's time to move to the next
step of building this application uh now
we have to go and add up
the code for
the app.js file so let's dive into the
app.js file and this is where
we will actually need to go and add
all of the code that is required for the
app component so all the code that's
relevant to
the app component we are going to add up
inside this specific component itself
which is going to be obviously the
app.js file so we have skeletal code
which is import importing the react
library and
let me get rid of the basic sample logo
we'll have app.css that's getting
imported here
besides that lot of other files that
we'll have to get in so
let me import playlist and this is these
are the components that we'll create
as we go forward and
we're going to get this from the
playlist folder
and the component the file is going to
be called playlist so we'll add that
then we'll have to go and also import
search bar so what we're basically doing
is we're going to split this app into
different components there's going to be
one component that manages uh the
playlist of all the tracks
one component will
act as the search bar so that's the
search bar component that we're going to
add so searching for tracks will be
managed by this we'll have another
component that we'll create that will
get imported into the root app component
which is a search results so this is
going to display the record set with the
set of results as an outcome of the
search criteria so search results slash
search
results and finally we'll go and import
spotify that's the spotify service from
so we'll create a utility folder which
will hold
the code that connects us to spotify so
that's what we are adding up next so all
of the imports are done one component
that manages the search bar so that
search bar search results let me correct
the spellings there that search results
that spotify and playlist so that's done
now let's move on to the class that
we're going to create here so let's
create a class app that goes and extends
dot component so that's going to be a
react.js component so that's a
constructor we discussed about props or
properties and state management and
that's what we are implementing we are
using the super keyword as a best
practice so that all the properties are
initialized in the constructor and also
we pass the values up the chain to the
superclass which is the root component
class now we're going to initialize
a variable called state that's going to
manage the state and we are interested
in tracking our search results so we'll
have multiple results so we'll store
that as an array the playlist would have
different names so we'll just call ours
new playlist that's the default name and
we will also store a list of tracks
which is going to be playlist
tracks so playlist tracks is going to be
a list of tracks and let's close
this block okay and this two is going to
be initialized within the constructor so
we'll add it here and now we need to do
the binding we discussed uh data binding
so let's look at
creating a search variable which will
hold this dot
search dot bind and bind to the context
of this very class so we are passing
this pointer then we'll create
another variable called add track which
to this dot add track dot bind and all
this functionality is what we're going
to add going forward so right now we're
just setting up the bindings then we'll
have capability to remove a track so
we'll say remove track so remove track
equal to this dot remove track dot pint
and
let's fix that so and all of this too is
going to be initialized as part of the
constructor so that's where we're going
to add it then we'll need to update
update the playlist name so we need
functionality that will help us to
update the name of the playlist so
functionality that helps us to update
the playlist name so this dot update
playlist
name is equal to this dot
update playlist name dot bind and this
is the pointer that we'll pass i need to
save the playlist so this dot
save playlist
equal to this dot save playlist dot find
and pass this and then i would also need
to remove the track that has been
searched for from the playlist so remove
track search go to this dot
okay remove track search and
dot find and finally one last function
that
executes
all of these which probably will bind to
bind to this context so all the
declarations are done in the constructor
now we need to provide the definitions
for all the methods that we actually
have added here so let me select this
tab inside and let's start with the
search function so we define the search
first it takes
some variable value that it searches on
and then i'm going to say spotify dot
search i'm going to search for term dot
then and that's an observable so the
moment it the search returns a value
it's going to call this uh callback
function and that's when we want to set
the state and we're going to set the
state for search results to whatever is
passed by the system so the search
results are going to be returned as a
callback and that's what we store as an
updated state now coming to the add
track method so let's scroll up and
we'll say add track and this will take
the track to be added let's declare a
temporary variable called tracks equal
to this dot the current state of all the
tracks that are there in the playlist
now if tracks dot find i'm going to call
the find method
so if we are able to find which means
that the track is already there in the
playlist then we would not want to add
it if it's not there in the playlist
that's when we would want to go and it
the triple equal to is an equality
operator that will check for both a
watch value match and a match on the
data type as well okay so if the track
is uh already saved to nothing if the
track is not safe just track the track
id because that is the track that will
uh have to be added if it's not if it's
already there then just return if it's
not there then we've got to go to this
variable called tracks we'll use the
javascript method called push and we
will push the current track into this
tracks array and then update the state
so we want to set the state of the
playlist tracks and this is how uh your
state management that we discussed in
detail is actually being practically
implemented here okay so the track has
been added now let's talk about the
remove track so that's the remove track
function and that's the track that we
want to remove so let's let tracks equal
to this dot state dot playlist tracks
those the set of current tracks that we
have and
let track search another temporary
variable equal to this dot the current
state of the search results then let's
take the tracks array equal to track
start filter so filter is of javascript
function that will again allow you to
remove a certain value create a
temporary variable called current track
use the lambda operator and if the
current track dot id is
not equal to the track dot id which
means this particular track is not there
in the list
okay so you need to remove that and
again i have a method called as unshift
which will actually get rid of the track
in the array and then we've got to so
we'll search whether that
track is existing in the tracks array if
it is then we simply want to remove it
if not we do nothing so we set the state
we need to update the state of the
playlist because the track has been
removed so the playlist tracks will have
to be updated with this tracks array
okay then we go for remove track search
that's the next method that also will
take a track as a parameter okay here we
are going to say let tracks which is
another temporary variable we'll give it
this current state of
search results and then we're going to
say tracks equal to tracks dot filter
current track current track dot id not
be equal to the track dot id and then
this is where we would want to say this
dot set
state
and we'll pick up search results
and let's go and assign that to track so
that's the updated uh set of tracks
after making that change let's remove
this and correct it okay so that's fine
so the remove track
is now the remove track in the remove
track search is now in place let's add
the do these functions which actually
again takes track as a parameter and
here we'll say this dot add track okay
so it adds the track and then it removes
the track from the search criteria so
the search component which is managing
searching of the tracks it will go and
remove it from there after adding the
new track so that's a combined
operation we want to execute then i've
got update
playlist name which will take the name
of the track to update and this dot set
state the playlist
name is what we need to update with the
name that is passed to this function
then we've got to save
playlists so
here we let me create a constant
variable constants are variables whose
values will not frequently change we'll
take all the track uris dot state dot
playlist tracks
will be dot map create a temporary
variable called track track dot url so
we actually want to go and uh now save
this on a
spotify so that's the reason we'll
access
spotify's safe playlist method this dot
state dot playlist name comma track uris
and if that is successful we then go
into a callback so that's the callback
anonymous function where we're going to
say this dot
set date and the playlist
name that we want to create on spotify
will be called new playlist so that's
the custom name that i want to provide
and the playlist tracks
define that this closes here
okay so that's for the update on
spotify
now here is where
the render method is going to return the
html now this html is the view
and react simplifies this by having the
javascript and the html in the same
file so you can actually go and access
the variables you've declared in the
script directly in your html view
and synchronize and bind the data
together so it helps
from a maintainability perspective so
even though everything is in the same
file it's well classified and
differentiated into different code
blocks so we'll add the anchor tag and
we'd say href is http localhost so
that's the default server port on which
this application will run okay and we
want to give it a custom url name of
musical file so the h1 terminates will
then say div class name equal to app
within that this is how we're going to
inject a search bar that's going to be
the search bar component injected here
and on search so that's the custom event
we will call a method called search so
on search we just call we bind to a
method called this dot search then we'll
open up another div here we'll have
class name equal to app dash playlist
and if you remember that's exactly the
css
class name that we refer to in the css
file
we have another component called search
results
that we're going to inject here
and
that's going to be search results here
search results will be equal to this dot
state dot search results so that's how
we can actually go and bind so that's
simple data binding the component is
going to be displayed with the data
bound and if somebody says add if if i
click on the add button for search
results
do these so it will add that new track
to the playlist by calling binding to
the duties function and it will remove
it from the search results text box then
we have another component called
playlist and here the playlist tracks
will be bound to this dot state dot
playlist tracks okay so on the top if
you look here we started with defining
all the function declarations in the
constructor then we provided the
function definitions okay that's how and
this that we passed refers to the
context of the current
component itself so whatever you put
into the app component or into the
respective component those values will
be then passed out here to these
individual functions okay so that's with
the playlist couple of things we'll have
to do is if somebody changes the name of
the track so on name change is going to
be another custom event where we have to
call this dot update playlist name and
we also have remove functionality so to
remove a track we would say equal to
this dot remove track on save equal to
this dot save playlist okay so that's
done and we close this so we seem to be
pretty much
on track the export
app will make this all of these
functions accessible across other
components it's very similar to the
public access specifiers etc that you
provide uh in other programming
languages so that's done we've created
our app component now let's create
another folder under components and
we've got to define all our various
components here this folder is going to
be
for the search bar so we'll name it
search bar we'll add two files within it
the search bar dot css okay and another
file that we'll need here is
search bar dot js
so that's in terms of the search bar
let's start with the css file so we'll
start with first styling search bar we
will say that the display should be flex
flex
direction should be column we want all
the items to be aligned at the center so
that's align item center then we'll add
up padding so padding top
is going to be 6.94
rpm and
margin
bottom is going to be 6.33
rem all right now let's add up for the
search bar so that's search bar we'll
add
for the input element we want the width
to be 287 pixels the padding to be zero
point eight eight
zero the border should be one pixel
solid white the border radius
will give a slight rounded edge uh to
give a web 3.0 look and feel so we'll
set up the border radius then we've got
margin bottom so we've got a bottom
margin that we want to add up then we
have color so let's add up the color c3f
so that's the color black then let's add
text alignment of
center and let's add up a font size of
one rem okay so that's how we've set
this up let's add
the search bar input is going to be
so if someone focuses so focus is the
got focus so if someone clicks inside so
the end user goes and clicks inside the
text box so we change the outline to
none okay and
so for the search bar we are interested
uh on input and if the input is
focused so that's the event that we are
looking for and then we would have a
button called search button so on the
search button the cursor will set it to
pointer so that's the cursor pointer the
width we set it to 8.11
rem the padding we are going to set up
to
0.77 rem and 0 the border radius
we'll set it to 54 pixels so we get a
slightly uh well-defined search button
with a nice little border let's also add
background color hash one db nine five
four that gives me a color then i've got
my text alignment let's set that to
center then we've got uh a font family
let's set up the font family to the same
standard font a t
and it's a part of the sans serif family
then we'll set up the font size
to 0.833
rem correct this
and finally
we will need
transition so all of these are basic
css properties so that will add a slight
transitional effect with a delay of
that many milliseconds
so transition background color we've
provided what else let me scroll up
let's also provide a border here so
we'll remove in fact let's remove the
border we we would not want a border on
the button that would look odd so i'll
get rid of the border and color we'll
specify
as per our standard color that we've
been using okay so that's the color
we've specified and then i've got font
weight of 500. finally we'll take
the search button and on the search
button we will register for the over
event so if someone takes their mouse
over the button that's the hover
event in that case uh if we hover around
the button we would want the background
color to change so it will appear to
have a slight little glow there a mouse
pointer moves over the button okay so
that's the opacity and
the rgb combination so that completes
the css file for the search bar and we
obviously now need to go and get the
code in for
our search bar component and that's
exactly what we are going to do next so
let's start with setting up the code for
the search bar first thing let's go and
import react from
react
next thing we would want to do is import
the search bar dot
css file then we define a class called
search bar which extends
react dot component we define our
constructor and we go and
pass these parameters to the base class
we also define
the state we'll just need one variable
here which is
the term to search for in the search bar
and then let's say this dot
will define a function called handle
term change which is going to be equal
to this dot handle handle term change
dot
find so that's going to be the first
function then a function that will do
the searching for us
which is this dot search so that's the
search function and we'll have it bind
to this
then we've got this dot
handle enter so the moment we enter into
that search text box
handle enter dot find this
so the functions are ready now let's go
for the first one which is handle term
change
we'll pass it a system defined keyword
of event this dot
set state and for the term
we will use the event keyword we will
get the value that is there inside that
text box the moment the search term the
user is entered changes so the search
criteria changes we trap the updated
value then in the search function we
will update the local property props dot
on
search
okay so we'll access the on search and
pass it the updated term and then we got
the handle enter on which uh we're also
going to pass the system define event
keyword so if there's any data flowing
along with the event we are interested
in it in this case the data is the key
code that the user is pressing and if it
is 13 that indicates that's the ascii
key code for the enter button so if the
enter is hit then the user is completed
entering the search criteria and we need
to start searching and that's where we
write our render method that's going to
render the html view and we return the
complete view here so that's the view
now that we want to return let's say
tiff class name equal to search bar then
on the input text box we will use
placeholder equal to enter song album or
artist that you want to search for on
change on the on change event the moment
the term changes we connect that to
handle term change we already have an
function that manages that and the
moment
keys are pressed and released so on key
up is where we would want to connect to
this dot handle enter okay and this is
place bracket that i have to put up here
so in the render function uh we're going
to return a value i shouldn't forget to
export the search bar okay so that's uh
what i want to export so we've exported
that okay so at the end of this uh what
we've done is we've written a render
method we've written our div tag here is
where we'll go and close
the div tag we've added an input and
here is where i'm going to add a button
provide a class name called search
button and the moment the end user
clicks on the button we're going to
connect it to this dot
search and we close
the button tag within the button tag
search so that
completes the
render function so in the render
function again let's run through all of
what we've written we started with
extending react.component we then added
a constructor passing props to the super
class constructor we created
state we set it to a value of
term and null so the state currently we
defined as term then we said handle term
changes search and handle enter should
be functions
that we want to add then handle term
changes
we defined search we defined and handle
enter we've also defined then we used
render render we said is going to return
to us
the html that we've specified okay we
dumped all the html that we want this
component to return to us
so on change and on key up are
two functions that
or two events that we connected to where
we called handle term change and handle
enter then we added a button where we
registered for the click event and
connected it to this dot search so all
the three functions uh that we
are actually written
uh so two things we've completed now uh
in the app class okay if you look at the
app class we've actually defined a set
of functions here that deal with the
playlist and adding applications etc
adding tracks removing tracks
then we've created
the search bar okay so we saw that the
search bar also we have specified a set
of functions
and all the functions that we defined we
have taken care to structure every
component separately so the search
component is doing something completely
different which is managing the search
bar we have the core the root app
component in which we have imported all
of the other set of javascript classes
that we are creating and that's how the
entire application is now structured so
and that's the core
concept when you're working with react
where you would actually have every
separate
block of
code or every separate functionality
handled in a different component
altogether so we've completed the search
bar component as well so two components
done and two components uh good to go so
we've got to start up on the next set of
components that we will need to build
and the next component is the track
component that will manage individual
tracks so a new folder a new file called
track.css
and
track.js
so that's going to manage
the tracks for us
so let's start with dot track we would
say display is flex
align items
center border bottom 1 pixel solid rgba
256
256
256 0.8 that's the opacity then let's
come to track action so we'll use all of
these classes uh when we write up the
html view we'll add a padding here of
0.5 we'll set up a font size
of 1.05
set up a transition color of 0.25
s
order of 0 pixel and
a background color of rgb a
0 0 0 0 color hash
so that's the color that we continue to
use then we bring in track another class
track action and if we hover over this
class we want
the gb values change to 265 265 2 6 5 5
is the last paragraph so that's the
hover
then we have track information so track
information is the next class that we're
dealing with we'll add the flex
parameter first display flex
and
then flex
direction
is going to be column let's have justify
content set up as
center and let's have height as
180 pixel so that's a track information
let's have another track information and
the h3 tags nested inside that for all
the h3 tags nested inside that we'll
need a margin bottom of 0.22
rem finally let's have track information
and paragraph tag we'll have the font
size
of 0.83
rem and a font weight of 300 and a color
as well that we'll add so let's add up a
color here rgba 2 6 256
256
256 and 0.8 okay so that's uh that's in
terms of the css and let's move to the
track and we'll move into the javascript
file so let's move into so let me take
what we added in the search bar i'll go
to the track.js
this will change to track.css
okay the constructor this will change to
add track so add track change this to
add track this is
remove track change this to remove track
get rid of this and that's going to be
the add track function and here we are
going to say uh this dot props
so we'll modify this this dot
props
dot on add this dot props dot track and
then we have the remove track so that's
going to be the remove track function
this function is not required so this
dot prop start on remove
and this is the track that we would want
to go and remove we'll add up another
function called uh render action so this
is going to be a function uh that we are
defining called render action and in
this we'll just check if this dot props
dot is
remove if this dot props dot is
removal so in that case
we would want to return so this is a
view action method that we are adding
which is going to go and add this button
with a class called as track action that
we've already written the css for and
this button will actually get added
via this render action function and this
dot
remove track is
what it's going to map to let's close
this
this is going to point to this specific
function so that's uh the closing button
tag okay so the closing button tag is
what
we've added there and the binding is
what we have done to this dot remove
track and
we will terminate this here so now the
render action uh let's also have the
return here
and we just add up the button and this
is going to add track so you can look at
how the component is completely dynamic
in nature so we have two buttons that
are going to be added this button with
the hyphen is going to remove the track
this button uh with the plus sign is
going to add the track and you can
actually see how simply it was done in a
render action function so the render
action function actually helped
with
checking that if on the value of the
props
and if the user uh depending on
the action performed you will actually
be able to remove a track or add a track
from the existing playlist okay and then
uh the class name here is now going to
be track the class name for
uh the enclosing div inside it so let me
get rid of this the class name for the
enclosing div here
is going to be
track dash
information within it we'll add h3 we'll
bind to this dot props dot track dot
name so the name of the track is going
to get bound here then in the paragraph
we will find to this dot props
dot track dot artist
and
with some gap this dot props dot track
dot algo so that's what
we've data bound to
and then let me add an iframe an iframe
allows us to
very easily inject some content into the
page within a small embedded window the
source parameter of the frame is going
to be https
open dot so here i'm connecting to the
spotify stream
spotify.com slash embed slash track and
close this so that's the spotify stream
that we are going to connect to and this
dot props dot track dot id so that's the
track id the width is going to be 300
the height parameter this the height
parameter is going to be 80 of the
iframe and
the frame border is going to be zero
and the allow
transparency so that's the opacity we'll
say true let's add allow
encrypted media so if spotify has
encrypted media that also would be
embedded here and we can also have the
title set to preview so that's uh with
the iframe okay at the bottom is where
we would want to so this could be an
empty element and we can close it
right around here so we wouldn't need
this part and then here i'm just going
to say this dot
render action so we call the render
action method uh which will actually
give us plus minus button to add and
remove uh
new element okay and that's uh what we
can actually go and add up there so
let's check now whether all that we've
done is good to go fine so everything
looks good uh in terms of the track
component now and
we have all of the functions in place
it's now time to jump into the
next component that we would require
after the track component and
that's going to be the track list so
this is going to be a list component
that will comprise of a list of tracks
inside it so we'll create a new folder
call this track list
and that's going to have
track list css
and it's going to have track list dot js
so that's the track
component now which
we're going to go ahead and use
and the css we don't need much so let's
just say track list
and we just provide a width of 100
okay that's all we'll need uh in the css
so let me add this in the css file save
this
and come to the js file now which is
going to have
the track list code that we will need to
add up so here again i'm going to say
import react
from react we'd also want to import
track list dot css
and
we also want to go and get track because
this component is going to be made up of
a collection of tracks
individual tracks so we want to get this
from track slash track and we'll define
class track list which is going to go
and extend
react dot
component
we just need the render method here
because this just needs to go it does
not really have any state of itself it
simply goes and returns a list of
individual tracks
so this class name is going to be track
list
and we'll find to this dot props dot
tracks dot map create a temporary
variable
and this will go and return
the track component
which is going to bind to individual
track data the key is going to be track
dot id so the key is going to be track
dot id
and on add on adding a new track we want
to bind to this dot properties dot and
we already have on add defined so that's
what we connect to we add up my
base bracket here okay and
then we would also need
is
removal equal to
this dot props dot is
removal and the on remove will do this
dot prop start on remove so that's for
the track removal and
so we've got our track list
uh oh yes we'll have to go and
also close the tip tag correctly and
also we need to go and export
so we'll have to go and export
the track
list
so we've got one more component done
which is track list and let's move on to
the next component now so we've got app
which is root we've got the search bar
that takes care of uh entering the
search criteria we've got individual
tracks that are searched and returned
and we've got a track list that manages
a set of track records so the track is
more relevant to the playlist and then
we've got the search results also to
manage once we search for some
set of tracks so we'll add a new folder
which manages search results
and this is going to have
search results dot css
and it's going to have
search results dot js
okay so we need a search results dot css
and js and here in the css file we'll
keep it simple for the search
results so we say search results we'll
set up the width of 50 percent we
set up the height of 950
pixels
we'll say
overflow y is
scroll we'll say padding is 0.88
rem background color will be rgba
95
23 23 0.7 and we will use the box model
so we'll provide a shadow dropping
shadow of zero for pixels to pixels to
pixels ash
and then uh
let's add
a scroll bar so
webkit
and mozart are the constants specific to
mozilla and
chrome browsers
so they target certain animated features
etc or properties
that are specific to those individual
browsers that's the reason we use those
constants
and then we'll also add a media query
that if it goes with a max
with one zero two zero pixels
in that case dot search results
width is 90 percent
with a margin bottom of 2
okay so
we're going to add hyphen so it's hyphen
webkit scroll bar zero pixel width
and we've set
transparent background so that's that's
about it with
the css i need to get to the uh js file
now let's move to the search results
js file and
that's where we will now have to go and
add up
the component code for search results
and let me take
pick this up from track list
add it up here this would be
search results and
we need the results will return to us a
list of tracks so we'll have to get uh
track list this will be track list
and
i'm just going to return class name will
also be
search results so that's the component
and this is going to export out search
results so it's accessible across
other components then we've got h2 with
results
let's go and create
tracked list with a set of tracks and we
will bind it to this dot props dot
search results and on the on add we're
going to bind to this dot props dot on
add so we already have that so that
basically
completes search results and
that leaves us with the last component
which is going to manage the playlist
for us so we'll add up a new books we'll
add up a new folder in components
and that's going to be playlist
and within that we will have a playlist
dot css
and
a playlist dot js
so that's our
playlist component now that
we're going to work with and the
playlist component is
uh we'll first set up
the css that we will need
to add up to the playlist and i'm just
going to
pick that up from
my code snippet so that's my playlist
and let me get all of that css here so
that's uh just this css for the playlist
nothing to do with react again pure css
let me get
into the js file and that's where we
will need to go and add all of our
component code so again let me go to the
track.js
the track list rather let me get this
and add it out here we'll make some
small changes this is going to be
playlist
i need to import the track list
because the playlist is going to contain
a list of tracks
this is going to be
playlist and
let me
here this will be playlist and we'll
leave this
for later okay let me also get
the constructor in so we'll add up the
constructor here and just one
function that we will need here which is
handle name change you know if i need to
change the name of the playlist so
handle name change and that's exactly
the function that we will need to write
code for so that's the event
and this dot props
dot on name change that's when we'll say
event dot
target dot value so we get the updated
playlist name coming to the render we
now need the input input
is going to be on change equal to this
dot
handle name change
the default
value we have already provided with a
hard coded value which is new playlist
so that's the default value if
not provided then we'll just pick up the
default value then we've got
track list so track list is
what i will add the tracks i'm going to
bind to this dot props dot playlist
tracks
so we're going to bind this to playlist
tracks
and here we will say
is
removal
equal to
true and on remove
equal to we'll bind that to this dot
props
dot on remove
finally we'll need a button we will use
class name equal to playlist
dash
save that's what we've added in the css
click equal to this dot props
dot on save and here we're going to say
save to
spotify so that's with the
playlist and yes we need to go and
export playlist and not track list
now we'll need to
do a quick look up
in spotify so let's go to this website
called developer.spotify.com
and once once we sign in
and create an id it takes us to our
dashboard
that's where we can create a sample
application the name of the application
will be musical file okay and
we'll say that we are building uh
some kind of desktop app for example for
which we want to connect this to and
we'll also need to provide uh so we'll
say next
refresh the dashboard so it's uh
asking me for a login so let me login
once more so moment i login that's going
to be description and i'll say maybe
this is why i need it i'll say no not
commercial integration agree with the
terms and conditions and we will say
submit
and that's the application that has got
created and now i can say edit settings
and
the redirect url here is what is
important
so it should accept connections from
http localhost 3000 that's the port on
which we will host our application okay
and we'll say save okay so that's uh now
there's a client id that is generated
here for my app which is unique so i'll
just copy that up let me come up to my
application under the source folder i'm
going to add a new folder called util
and under that a new file called
spotify.js
so we will start with
adding our code to the spotify.js file
that we've just created as a new file
within the newly created util folder the
first line of code is going to define a
client id variable that equates to the
client id that we will generate on
spotify so this is going to be the
spotify generated client id which is a
unique id associated for the developer
to connect to the spotify api and we
will look at
the source of that as we go through the
demo the next variable that we'll create
is the redirect url or let's call it
redirect uri and that will equate to
localhost colon 3000 which is the port
and we'll create
another variable called the access token
let's also create another constant
variable called spotify and this will
work like a function expression so we'll
equate it to a function called get
access token and we will say if access
token is true then return the access
token now let's declare a constant
variable called access token match which
will be equal to window dot location dot
href dot match and we will say this is
equal to access token which will be
equal to and we will give a rejects
expression to do a pattern match
ampersand so that we can actually get
into the url and extract
the token information from that and
hence
the pattern match is crucial here
another constant
variable called
expires in match
equal to window dot location dot href
dot match here we will read the expiry
information using another edgex
expression from the url ampersand
asterisk so that's the second constant
variable we've created now we will say
if access token match and
expires in match in that case
the access token should be equal to
access token match of one then we create
a variable called
expires in equal to we'll do a typecast
to number and we will take the first
parameter from the expires in match
that's done then we will say
window.settimeout
and we are going to say access token
equal to comma
expires in multiplied by thousand then
we will say window dot history dot push
state and we will say access token we
pass the second parameter as null the
last parameter as slash and close this
and we will return access token else
we will say const access
url equal to https
accounts.spotify.com
slash
authorize
client underscore id equal to dollar
client id ampersand response type equal
to token ampersand scope equal to
playlist dash
modify so we are actually building the
url that will now get generated so we
will say modify dash public and redirect
url equal to dollar redirect uri so we
have constructed the url now that will
go out and get generated in the browser
and here we are going to say window dot
location equal to access url then we'll
add the search criteria function which
accepts a term as a parameter to search
on here we will say constant access
token equal to spotify dot get access
token so we get a reference to the same
access token return we call the fetch
function and we're going to pass
https
api dot
spotify.com slash
v1 slash
search question mark that's the query
string that we will add type equal to
track and ampersand g equal to dollar
and we will pass term comma as the
header information we will need to pass
the authorization where we will say that
the pairer is dollar access token dot
then response
return response dot json dot then so the
return of this function once it
completes we will then call the next
function so json response
and then we will say
return response dot json after that
another then block so we'll now say json
response
and if
not
jsonresponse.tracks
in that case we will return
an empty array else
we will return json response dot tracks
dot items dot and we will pass
we'll create track as
a variable with a lambda expression and
we'll create a temporary json object
with id and that's where we want to
associate track dot id that was returned
as the search result the name is going
to be associated with track dot name the
artist is going to be associated with
track dot artists of zero dot name the
album is going to be track dot album dot
name and the uri we will equate track
dot url so that completes uh this block
will open the next and we this will be
the save playlist which will take the
name and the track uris and here we will
check if not
name or not track uris dot len in that
case we simply return out of the code
and then we declare a constant variable
called access token which will be equal
to spotify dot get access token so we
get a reference to the access token we
then declare headers authorization
bearer is going to be dollar access
token and we'll create a user id and now
we will return the fetch result where we
will pass https
api dot spotify dot com slash v1 slash
me so that's the url comma headers
will be the header information then we
call the then function declare response
as a variable use the lambda expression
and access response dot json we use the
then block to declare json response
here we say user id equal to json
response dot id and then we return fetch
https
api dot spotify.com
slash v1 slash users slash dollar of
user id slash playlist so this is how
we've constructed the urls manually here
we will say assign headers to the
headers variable we'll assign method as
host so the data is sent as part of the
body and not as part of the url and
as the body we will say json.stringify
to convert this parameter name and then
we will generate a response variable to
response.js
and then we'll create jsonresponse with
the lambda operation we'll create a
constant playlist id which is equal to
jsonresponse.id we will return fetch
https
api.spotify.com
v1 users
dollar user id slash playlist slash
dollar again we are constructing the url
so playlist id will be replaced here
then we will say tracks
and close this comma and here again we
will say headers would equate to the
headers
variable be constant headers and this
goes here okay everything fixed now so
here we are going to say headers should
equate to headers and
the method is going to be post and
the body is going to be json dot
stringify uris track uris and we close
this we close this block we close this
block and we close this block so that
completes our code of course one more
thing we have to do which is export this
class out so export default spotify and
that completes the code for
the spotify.js
which is part of our utils class so
let's move on now to the next step so
uh here is uh the client id that we'll
have to exactly match so i'll copy this
client id and provide it here so that's
the client id uh that we actually need
and we could also store it
out here
so that's the
client id and that's the redirect url
that we've also defined there and we
just create an access token if here the
access token is true we return access
token
so the access token is something that we
are going to do a match from uh
the moment we try and connect with this
particular url and you can look here
that this is the access url that we are
trying to connect with okay with the
client id and post fixed with the
redirect url right and then i've got a
simple search function which returns an
observable so we try to fetch data using
the search term that we provided okay we
try to fetch data using the search term
provided if we are successful we get a
response of the data and accordingly
we'll iterate over the json response and
get a list of tracks out of it and do a
mapping of this json object to the track
id name artist information album name
etc and here
just like a data access layer very
similar to a data access layer we've got
a save function which will save this
data to spotify as well so i've got a
save playlist and i've got search so
these are the two functions which will
go and connect to the spotify service uh
by using this client id and it will
allow me to
access that information in terms of
returning a stream of json data and will
then allow me to
go ahead and push that json data into
our application so now we
actually need to start up the
application so i'll go to the terminal
and rather let me go to view and
bring out the terminal so this is the
integrated terminal that's there in the
tool and it just opens powershell from
which you can actually fire your
commands so i'm going to say node
package manager npm start to actually
start up this application so that's
going to do a full compile and
so we will fire this up give access so i
need to grant access to that port 3000
let's give it time to run and that's the
app now that
you can actually see here so this is uh
the search bar that we actually had okay
then we had the results we had the
playlist now the results is going to
consist of
a set of tracks which are maintained by
the track list and then you can take
individual tracks with the plus and
minus button and add them into the
playlist okay so that's how
it's typically going to work okay so as
you can view here i'm just going to
search for an artist
and we'll click on the search button it
goes to spotify tries to connect there
and says
that i need to agree to the terms and
conditions and i've just agreed to that
so the very fact that it actually uh
gave us uh a confirmation link the
moment we tried to connect and execute
our application uh that's proof enough
that it actually went and connected to
the
service there and tried to return a
value to us so this is what we did we
just added an artist we said search
and you can see now it's successfully
connected i've got a list of tracks
available from this artist and you can
see the plus buttons getting added on
the fly so that was the render action
these are
buttons that got added onto this list of
tracks dynamically the moment the search
results returned a value so i can click
on this plus sign and you can see that
the track gets added to the playlist
okay as in when i click here so i've
added a couple of tracks
if i go back to my dashboard of my music
file application and that i've created
here in the developers portal of spotify
on
developers.spotify.com it's blank so now
i'm going to click on save to spotify
okay and that clears the playlist
so let me come here
and
now when i come out here we saw that it
actually got
successfully connected out here now i'll
have to log in to so this was the
development app that we actually created
on the developers portal of spotify now
we will go to spotify.com
so i'll just go to the spotify website
and it says do you want to launch the
web player and all that so let me click
on that so it just launches
and can you see here this is the new
playlist
that just got added right and there were
four songs that i'd actually added to
the playlist and you can see here those
four songs have got added out here okay
so i can go here and
i can delete this playlist and say i
want to delete it okay so there's no
playlist now i'll go back here
i'll add two tracks and i'll say save to
spotify so that's how you actually saw
that the new playlist you can see the
new playlist has come back here okay and
that's the playlist uh the playlist has
got generated again and that's the new
playlist that
got created and we deleted it but it
still got created again and that
indicates the connectivity uh that we
successfully created with this react app
and the core concept of the react app
was breaking it down into components
which is the search component then we
created the track component we created
the track list to maintain a list of
tracks
then we created the search results which
will generate a list of results which
further contains a track list and this
is the embedded iframe which gave us the
response which is scrollable here and
you can see that the iframes we created
allowed us to scroll this
with this embedded web page inside the
iframe container so with that
i hope we've been successful with
explaining the concept of component
based design and architecture with react
and how important it is to create
individual components and the benefit of
that being that you can isolate change
requests to a certain component you can
promote reusability wherever you want
the same feature to be implemented on
the page you can just inject that same
component and the same implementation
and the same features can be reused so
it promotes reusability it promotes
flexibility to change it isolates your
change request to single components
preventing the massive effort of
recompiling and retesting the entire
application as a whole and so with that
we come to the end of this session i
hope you enjoyed building these
applications thank you so much for being

British Airways it's one of the
best-known brands in aviation we have
about 40,000 employees there can be
quite a difficult bunch of people to
reach we had our new CEO come in Alex
Cruz and he wanted to make sure he could
get his message across to everyone
wherever they were all the information
was spread across multiple different
sources they had to use a number of
logins we had a number of senior
employees do have British Airways issued
equipment but the vast majority of them
don't have those we wanted to make a
level playing field in that sort of
sense and creating the app is the
platform to do that many of our apps in
the recent past are being built on the
iOS platform it's a default platform but
we've had trouble moving it to other
platforms we used Microsoft Visual
Studio 2017 to developers Ameren forms
app that gives us 95% code reuse across
all of the platforms that we were
targeting which was iOS Android and
Windows Phone visual studio team
services and summer in test cloud
particularly allowed us to iterate
quickly through several releases of the
application because we were able to
check as we went along that our tests
were still passing and the product was
still robust enough to deploy and we
were able to add extra features quickly
without worrying about lengthy
regression tests for our back-end
services we use as your application
services and also as your sequel
database to provide the data resources
to the application and to provide
integration with our other back-end
systems to achieve single sign-in for
the application we have federated across
from Azure Active Directory to our
Oracle access management and that was
fantastic
that was the equivalent of putting a
very old car on the moon it feels like a
great achievement to know that they're
finding a better experience it's working
really well for us and we hope that this
is the beginning of a very fruitful
relationship

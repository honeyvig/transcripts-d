hello and welcome to this session of
blockchain myself saurav and i'm part of
the simply lenti what's in it for you
today let's discuss what are the issues
with today's current banking system how
bitcoin has solved these issues and how
bitcoin is evolving what is blockchain
technology and what are its features
like public distributed ledger how
encryption works proof of work algorithm
and mining and we will also discuss
certain use cases of blockchain mining
now what are the current set of issues
in today's banking system in order to do
any transaction on a banking channel
today it costs a very high transaction
fees so suppose you want to do a
transfer of money from your account to
someone's else account through a banking
channel the bank might charge a fee for
200 transaction up to five dollars and
this receiver will end up receiving 195
dollar which in percentage terms is a
very high percentage of transaction fee
also as of today there's a lot of
scenarios people end up doing double
spending for example over here the user
has eight hundred dollars in her account
but she ends up sending thousand dollars
500 each to two users double spending is
a unique problem where digital money is
spent twice so what does it tend to do
is the user is able to make two
purchases with the amount which is less
than the purchase value so in this
scenario the lady was able to buy a
commodity worth more than 800 dollars
though she only had 800 in her account
also the banking systems are prone to
hacking hackers attack financial
institutions and gain unauthorized
access to data they can do transactions
on your behalf which you are not aware
of or they can do the transfer of money
to some illegitimate accounts in 2017
the number of frauds in india through
atm cards and net banking total to 1785
each amounting to more than one lakh
rupee so if you see the current banking
system is prone to so many hacks that it
can amount to huge cost of money now how
bitcoin can solve these problems now
bitcoin is a decentralized system so
which allows you to do a value transfer
transaction at a lower transaction fee
as low as one dollar as compared to the
five dollar which the bank was charging
and at the end the receiver receives the
true value of the amount which was sent
by the sender bitcoin follow a
decentralized system where no third
party like governments banks or any
other financial intermediary is involved
during the transaction between the
sender and receiver thereby reducing the
cost of transaction drastically and that
is the primary objective of
cryptocurrencies or technologies like
blockchain which advocates the removal
of intermediaries now bitcoin is a
cryptocurrency that runs on blockchain
now how bitcoin solved the problem of
double spending double spending is
avoided through the basic structure of
blockchain which involves verification
of transactions so in the previous
example as we saw when the user
transferred 500
to the first person then she will not be
able to transfer the another 500
based on the basic validation of the
blockchain and we will see how suppose
you're trying to spend the same bitcoin
in a second transaction after the first
transaction has been confirmed the
saturn transaction will not get verified
and does become invalid and this will
happen because after the first
transaction has been confirmed your
balance will be verified in the second
transaction your address identity will
be validated and if suppose you are
trying to spend more than what the
balance you have the miners the
validators of the blockchain network
will discard that particular transaction
and will not add it to the main
blockchain network thereby double
spending becomes as good as impossible
in a blockchain each block is linked to
its previous block the transactions
become invalid for a specific bitcoin
which has already been spent so you
can't spend the bitcoin which you have
already spent public ledger a public
ledger records all bitcoin transactions
where it is accessible to everyone who
is associated with the system it is 100
transparent system any transaction
happening is visible on the public
ledger once a user joins the blockchain
network he gets a copy of all the
blockchain
since its initiation or inception and
the first block in a blockchain is
called the genesis block though the
public ledger is accessible to everyone
only the user's address and the
transaction details are visible to the
users on the bitcoin network by looking
at the address you can't figure out to
whom this address belongs the identity
is secure of the address owner this
keeps blockchain safe from data
tempering each block on the blockchain
is aware of who is its previous block
and this with entire blockchain is
created even if a hacker tries to hack
one block it would have to change the
entire subsequent chain ahead of this
block which will require huge amount of
computation power for the hacker in
order to make the changes across all the
blocks which is next to impossible now
what is blockchain imagine two friends
living far away and would like to
transfer money using blockchain
technology blockchain is a decentralized
system of secure and trusted distributed
databases it's a distributed ledger
which records and shares the transaction
details across many nodes which are part
of the network so that the data is not
modified so each and every transaction
which happens on a blockchain network it
distributed across all the nodes on the
blockchain each and every participant
has the same copy of the ledger and it's
an immutable ledger once a record or a
transaction is registered it cannot be
modified blockchain was originally
introduced to timestamp digital
documents and prevent tampering of
records in simple terms a chain of
blocks that contain information is is
called blockchain now when a transaction
occurs its related information is
recorded into a block so as you see a
transaction initiated in one corner of
the globe can get registered on the
block and then that block is being
verified validated by the miners of the
public ledger and then added to the main
blockchain a block contains aggregated
transactions in a single block which a
miner has to validate and in lieu of
that the miner gets rewarded now let's
take a closer look at what all are the
components of a block so whenever we
talk about a blockchain what is actually
a block and what it consists of now
there are four major components each
block contains a previous hash data data
is nothing but the aggregation of the
transactions which are aggregated in the
block a nuanced value and a hash of the
block itself now what is previous hash
previous hash is the attribute which is
connecting a block to its previous block
so the previous hash attribute consists
of the hash value of its previous block
data it consists the details of the
sender's address the receiver's address
and the transaction amount so basically
there could be multiple transactions
amongst multiple senders and receivers
so each block will consist n number of
transactions and each transaction will
have a sender's address a receiver
address and a transaction amount nonce
so basically the bitcoin uses a proof of
work algorithm and in order to execute
the algorithm nonce is a random value
used to vary the output of the hash
value so proof of work is the process of
transaction verification done in
blockchain hash hash is like a digital
fingerprint it is the fingerprint of the
current block now where it takes an
input value of the previous hash the
data and the norms and produces an
output value of fixed length so bitcoin
network uses
sha-256 hashing algorithm to generate a
256-bit length hash and this is the
output it looks something like a
hexadecimal value now what are the
features of blockchain a blockchain is a
decentralized public distributed ledger
that is used to record transaction
across many computers so this is a
sample transaction which you are seeing
these are set of three transactions a
transferring money to b b to c and c to
b a distributed ledger is a database
that is shared among all the users who
are part of the blockchain network the
transactions are accessed and verified
by users associated to the bitcoin
network thereby making it less prone to
cyber attack it is actually enclosed
within all the participants who are part
of the network now let's take an example
where these bitcoin users are
transferring money so here we have
example like bella is trying to transfer
money to john john is trying to transfer
money to elsa and elsa is trying to
transform money to jack so these are the
three transactions which are to be
initiated now suppose these transactions
were being happening on a central ledger
and it gets corrupted so there is a
chance of the data getting tampered to
solve this problem a public distributed
ledger plays a vital role now it ensures
that users part of this cycle have a
copy of the transaction details each
user will have a copy of each
transaction bella john elsa jack they
all have the same ledger and this is
what is called as distributed ledger
everyone is having the same copy now in
case one of the users like elsa
misplaces her transaction detail she can
easily be corrected by the other
participants because they have the
golden copy the correct copy or if
either of them attempts to alter the
record the alternate transaction copies
with the other users will negate the
alteration because they will see that
amongst all the participants only one
participant is having a different copy
they will negate the copy of the user
and they will rectify it encryption
blockchain eliminates unauthorized
access by using cryptographic algorithm
sha-256 to ensure that the blocks are
kept secure so sha-256 is the
cryptographic algorithm which is used
each user in the blockchain has their
own keys so any user which on boards a
typical blockchain network is always
provided with two set of keys one is
private one is public private key is
known only to the sender also it is used
to confirm if the origin of the
transaction is legitimate public key it
is also used to uniquely identify the
user but it is shared by the sender with
every transaction it floats on the
blockchain network and we will see how
now let's take a look at a typical
transaction verification process suppose
a sender wants to send a message he will
pass the message through the hash
function and generate a hash value of
the message now after the hash value is
being created it is passed through a
signature algorithm and with the private
key a digitally signed document is
created now the transaction message
original message the digitally signed
document and the public key are
transmitted to the receiver now at the
receiver end the transaction message is
passed through a hash function to get a
hash value and that hash value is
compared with the hash value obtained by
passing the digital signature and public
key through a verification function and
then both the values are compared now
let's see how the hash function works
the hash function creates a unique
digital fingerprint of data you pass the
message through the hashing function and
it generates a hash value this hash
value is called a digital print it has a
very unique property any hashing
function is a one way function it cannot
be reversed you cannot decode the
original value from the hashed value it
is a one way encryption so here are some
examples whatever be the size of the
input data the hash value is always of
256 bit length and we will take a look
at the demo at the end of this session
where i'll show you how to generate a
hash value using sha-256 now let's
consider an example of gmail using
hashing algorithm whenever you are
entering the username and password that
password is never directly persisted in
any of the gmail database it is
persisted using hashing function so once
you have created your password and again
once you log in your password is again
passed to the hashing function and
compared with the hash value persisted
in the database and once both these hash
value matches then only you are allowed
to log in so every time you log into
gmail your password is hashed into a
value and compared against the one
stored in the database the hash values
match with the one in database and then
the inbox is displayed on your screen
now let's take a look of what is the
proof of work algorithm proof of work is
a method to validate transactions in a
blockchain network by solving a complex
mathematical puzzle and this whole
process is called mining finding the
nonce value is the mathematical puzzle
that users or miners need to solve in
the bitcoin network so it takes huge
amount of computational power and
resources of the miner in order to find
out that nuance value users trying to
solve the puzzle are called miners the
puzzle is solved by determining a nonce
that generates a hash value and results
an output lesser than a target so in any
proof of work algorithm there is always
a target which is predefined for a block
the miner has to use the nonce in order
to generate a hash which has to be less
than the target miners verify
transactions within a block and adds the
block to the blockchain when they have
confirmed and verified the transaction
with proof of work miners compete
against each other to solve the
mathematical puzzle the first miner who
solves the puzzle is rewarded and when a
block is solved the transactions
contained in a block are also considered
valid and the bitcoins associated with
the transactions then get deducted from
the originator or the sender and moves
to the receiver now let's see how proof
of work works so let's take a look at
the block and its components the
previous block hash it stores the hash
value of the previous block of the
blockchain data it contains the list of
all the transactions which have been
aggregated in the block nonce is the
random value which is used to generate a
hash value less than the target and hash
is the digital signature of the block
itself the hash is generated using a
hashing function called
sha-256 now using the nonce when the
hash is generated if its output is less
than the target then the puzzle is
deemed to be solved the block is
considered to be validated if not then
the miner increments the nonce by value
1 and then again rehashes generate a
hash and goes through the cyclic process
till the time it is not able to generate
a hash less than the target in
blockchain the target is adjusted every
two zero one six blocks which is
approximately every 14 days the average
time of block formation is 10 minutes
and the difficulty target of the puzzle
increases or decreases depending on the
time it takes to mine the blocks so it
is the inbuilt network which is
generating the target for the puzzle to
get solved and it fluctuates the
difficulty based on the time it takes to
mind block proof of work is hard to
produce but very easy for binders to
verify so point to be noted here is once
the block is hashed the remaining miners
are supposed to validate the work which
one miner has done but they are not
required to find the nonce again so
basically the miner who is supposed to
earn the bitcoin has done the hard work
but the others miners on the network
just have to verify his validation in
blockchain when miners use their
resources time money electricity etc to
validate a new transaction and record
them on the public ledger they are given
a reward now that reward is in bitcoins
itself which as of today stands at 12.5
bitcoins and to add there is no other
way that the bitcoins can be generated
in a bitcoin network it is only through
mining now the bitcoin network
internally halves the reward after every
21k blocks which is approximately every
four years so now subsequently whenever
the time period will end the mining
reward will get reduced to 6.25 btc now
let's take a look at a demo now as i
said this is a demo to showcase how to
generate a sha-256 hash using an input
value so whatever input i have the hash
which is generated it is of 256 bytes
even if i add a new value it will again
only generate a 256 bit length hash
now let's take a look at a typical
blockchain structure we have a block
over here which has one transaction
added to it now this is orange in color
because it has not been mined and i can
only add a subsequent block to it once
it is mined now as this is the first
block in this particular blockchain the
previous hash value of this block is all
zeros and it is a called as a genesis
block now as i have mined this block the
hash which is the digital signature of
this block itself has been generated and
i can now add a block primary thing
which to be noted over here is that the
previous hash value of this new block is
the hash value of the previous block it
has two transactions aggregated in it
and i can again mine it and now the hash
of this block has been generated so this
highlights the typical data structure of
a blockchain and how blocks are linking
themselves to each other now let's take
a look of a typical transaction which
happens over a blockchain now i want to
send money from wallet 1 to wallet 2 and
i want to send one dollar there is a
transaction fee of point one dollar
associated with this transaction now as
i have initiated that transaction wallet
one has been deducted as one point one
dollar and it is a pending transaction
this transaction is waiting to be mined
so i can choose any of the miners to do
this transaction the pending transaction
is done and now block 2 if you see has
been added the previous hash value of
this block is 0 0 a 9 is the hash value
of block one another thing to be noted
the value of the amount in wallet two
has also got incremented by one done
again we can try another transaction
transferring one dollar again from
wallet one to wallet three and
say from wallet 2 to wallet 3 i have
done a transaction it is pending it can
be mined and block 3 has got added now
what are the key takeaways today we
learned what are the current issues in
the banking system and how bitcoin
solved them what is blockchain features
of blockchain and the demo of the
features which we have seen i hope you
had a great learning session and i'll
meet you in the next session thank you

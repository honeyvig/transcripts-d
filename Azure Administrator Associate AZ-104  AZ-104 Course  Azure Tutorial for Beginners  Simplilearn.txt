the simulator to identify your skills
and weaknesses so that you can work on
them
now let's have a look at some of the
practice questions for your better
understanding of this examination
so the first question is
you have an azure subscription named
subscription1 that contains an azure log
analytics workspace named workspace1
you need to view the error events from a
table named even
which query should you run in the
workspace one and the options are
get event where even type equal equal
error
option b
search in event error
option c select from even by even type
equal equal error
and d
search in even where even type is equal
error
and the correct answer is
option b
now moving on to the next question
you have an azure subscription name
subscription one
subscription one contains the resource
groups in the following table
rg1 has a web app named web app one
web app one is located in west europe
you move web app to rg2 what is the
effect of the move
and the options are
the app service plan
for web app 1 remains in the west europe
policy 2 applies to web app 1.
option b
the app service plan for web app 1 moves
to north europe policy 2 applies to web
app 1.
option c the app service plan for web
app 1 remains in the west europe and
policy one applies to web app one
and option d the web app service plan
for web app one moves to north europe
policy one applies to web app one
and the correct answer is option a
if the source and target plans are in
the same resource group and geographical
region you can migrate an app to another
app service plan
now the app service plan in which your
app runs determines the region in which
it runs you cannot however change the
location of an app service plan
so now coming on to the next question
you have an azure subscription link to
an azure active directory cleaning the
tenant includes a user account name
user1
you need to ensure that user one can
assign a policy to the tenant root
management group
what should you do and the options are
assign the owner role for the azure
subscription to user 1 and then modify
the default conditional access policies
option b assign the owner role for the
azure subscription to user 1 and then
instruct user 1 to configure access
management for azure resources
option c assign the global administrator
role to user 1 and then instruct user 1
to configure access management for azure
resources
an option d create a new management
group
and delegate user 1 as the owner of the
new management
and the correct answer is
b
now let's move on to the next question
you need to ensure that an azure active
directory
username admin 1 is assigned the
required role to enable traffic
analytics for an azure subscription
now the solution is you assign the owner
role at the subscription level to admin
1.
does this meet the goal and the option
is either yes
or no
and the correct answer is
yes
your account must meet one of the
following to enable traffic analytics
so your account must have any one of the
following as your roles at the
subscription scope owner contributor
reader or network contributor
now the next question is
you have an azure subscription
users access the resources in the
subscription from either home or from
customer sites
from home users must establish a
point-to-site vpn to access the azure
resources the users on the customer
sites access the azure resources by
using site-to-site vpns
so you have a line of business app named
app1 that runs on several azure virtual
machines
the virtual machines run windows server
2016
so you need to ensure that the
connections to app one are spread across
all the virtual machines so what are the
two possible azure services that you can
use
and the options are
a an internal load balancer
b a public load balancer
c
an azure content delivery network or cdn
option d traffic manager
and option e and azure application
gateway
and the correct answer is
a
and e
network traffic from the vpn gateway is
routed to the cloud application to an
internal load balancer the load balancer
is located in the front-end subnet of
the
application
now let's have a look at the companies
that hire azure administrator associate

bosch microsoft and yahoo are some of
the great companies that hire azure
administrator

right place this video will help you out
but before we begin if you haven't

bell icon to never miss an update
so let's begin
now let's say you're using an instagram
application
every time you refresh new content is
loaded onto your screen
you can like a picture add new ones
search your profiles and do much more
although it provides a seamless user
experience there's a lot that goes in
the back end as well so every
application typically consists of the
front end the back end and the database
together they form the full stack
so what exactly is front-end development
then now front-end development is the
part of web development that develops
and creates the website's front-end
elements or features
now a front-end developer in a sense is
responsible for everything that you see
it could be text alignment navigation
colors etc
now the main objectives of front-end
development is responsiveness and
performance
so now that you know what front-end
development is let's look at the skills
that will help you land a job
first up is the foundation
so first things first to become a
front-end developer you need to start
with html
move on to css and javascript now these
are the actual fundamental languages for
front-end development
html is used to structure our web pages
css is used to make them beautiful and
javascript is used to make the program
run and add interactivity
however knowing just these will not help
you
you will have to learn the second
important skill that is frameworks
now there are several front-end
frameworks that make development way
easy
now to name a few or the most important
ones we have react there's angular
view
jquery and ember
now i'm sure you must have heard of
these frameworks
react is a ui development library
written in javascript
although react is just a library and not
a framework its usage is rampant
nowadays the ad goes beyond simple ui
and has many extensions like flux and
react native for complete application
architecture support
talking about angular again this is an
open script javascript framework based
on typescript
so as a framework angular offers
advantages and it also provides a
standard structure for developers in a
team to work with
you know it allows users to create huge
applications that are easy to manage
talking about vue
it is also an open source javascript
framework and is again used to build
user interfaces for single page
applications
now i'm sure you must have heard of
jquery which is again a trendy
javascript framework and an application
development platform
it is leaner it is fast loading and
comes with features that make life of a
javascript application developer more
accessible
it is used more and more to be the
foundation and the primary driving force
of web development today
and lastly we have ember which is again
an open source javascript client-side
framework it comes with built-in
environment with fast rebuilds auto
reload and a test runner
so these are some of the frameworks that
you're expected to be proficient at now
the third skill that is crucial is
version control system
now we use version control systems to
track our code history and work more
collaboratively with others that's why
you will find it in every job
description now there are multiple
version control systems available in the
market today there's git there's
subversion etc so just focus on git
which is the most popular one and don't
worry about other version control
systems knowing these version control
systems will definitely add more
credibility to your resume
the fourth skill that is crucial
is the css preprocessor
now to give you an insight into why we
need preprocessors css is an old
language and it has its own limitations
if you write css for medium or large
size applications your code starts
looking messy so every time you want to
change something you end up breaking
something else
instead you can make use of a css
preprocessor
now a preprocessor is a program or a
tool that lets you generate css from a
different language that is better and
more compatible than css
so instead of using plain css you can
use another language that looks pretty
similar with css we give our code to a
css preprocessor that converts it into
plain css which every browser
understands that's the purpose of css
preprocessors there are many of these
available today there's sas less and
stylus to name a few
and lastly the most important skill
required is testing and debugging
now a very important aspect of web
development is to make sure that the end
result is error-free
free of bugs and seamless experience for
the user
therefore the ability to test and debug
a website is another essential skill
that a front-end developer needs to have
there are various methodologies that can
enable front-end developer to make sure
that the websites or the product not
only looks good but also functions
smoothly
so although these are the top five
skills that a front-end developer must
possess
he must also have good communication and
interpersonal skills
a good understanding of apis and how the
app needs to behave is crucial to make a
good developer

hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this video we are
going to discuss 32 important points
regarding physiology of renal system
point number one
normal urinary output is 1.15 liters
number to increase urinary output is
called polyuria number 3 reduce urinary
output is called a Liguria for stoppage
of urine formation is called anuria
5 loss of proteins in urine is called
protein area 6 loss of RBC and urine is
called hematuria number 7 excess glucose
loss in urine is called glycosuria
number 8 they increase osmotic pressure
prevents the reabsorption of water
leading to excretion of excess water
through urine this phenomenon is called
osmotic diuresis mannitol urea sucrose
and glucose are the best osmotic
diuretic see number nine brush border is
present in the convoluted tubules number
10 hairpin Bend is seen in the loop of
Henle number 11 the part of nephron that
is least permeable to water is ascending
limb buff loop of Henle fluid in this
segment becomes hypertonic number 12
this descending limb both loop of Henle
is highly permeable to water fluid in
this segment becomes hypertonic number
14 glucose is completely reabsorbed
actively in the proximal convoluted
tubules
if it's concentration is below 180
milligrams in blood this is called renal
threshold of glucose number 15 high
threshold substances are glucose amino
acids and vitamins number 16 low
threshold substances are urea uric acid
and phosphate number saline
clean non threshold substances are
creatinine 18 antidiuretic hormone or
vasopressin is secreted in the
supraoptic nucleus of hypothalamus and
is released in the posterior pituitary
number 19 and the diuretic hormone
vasopressin is synthesized in
hypothalamic nuclei number 20 in kidney
the structures which form the counter
current system are the loop of Henle and
Vasa recta number 21 loop of Henle is
counter current multi-player whereas the
Vasa recta is counter current exchanger
number 23 sodium is secreted and water
is absorbed into the medullary inter
cesium in the descending limb whereas
sodium is absorbed and water is secreted
in the ascending limb this is called
counter-current exchange by Vasa recta
number 24 tubular transport maximum is
the rate at which a substance is very
absorbed from the renal tubular number
25 tubular transport - month for glucose
is 375 milligrams folk minute number 26
renal threshold of glucose is 180
milligrams per deciliter number 27 renal
plasma clearance is the volume of plasma
from which a substance is completely
removed by the kidney in a given amount
of time
number 28 during resting conditions the
kidneys received 1300 milliliter of
blood per minute or 26 percent of
cardiac output number 29 I mean the low
corticoids released from the adrenal
cortex increases the reabsorption of
sodium in proximal tubule ascending limb
and destroy convoluted tubules number 30
two-thirds of sodium is reabsorbed in
the proximal convoluted tubules number
31 gigolos glomerular feedback in this
as the rate of flow through the
ascending limb of loop of Henle and 1st
part of distal convoluted tubules
increases glomerular filtration in the
same nephron decreases and conversely a
decrease in flow increases the GFR this
is called feedback and it maintains the
constancy of flowed delivered to the
distal tubules number 32 Glomar low
tubular balance it is an increase in the
GFR causes an increase in the
reabsorption of solutes and consequently
of water primarily in the proximal
tubular
so that in general the percentage of
solute reabsorbed is held constant this
process is called as gloom hollow
tubular balance on this prominent for
sodium that's it for today's thirty two
session guys all the points discussed
here are very important from neat and
aims point of view
hope you all revise them well thank you

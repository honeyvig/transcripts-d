as a.net Maui developer building mobile
and desktop applications I'm often
adding a lot of new features and at the
same time I'm also diving into a lot of
new code bases so I want to be able to
iterate quickly on my applications but I
also want to be able to jump into
existing code bases and really
understand what the code is doing and
that's where GitHub co-pilot and GitHub
copilot chat can be really exciting and
awesome to use you can only add new
features but also learn more about how
the code works and then spice it up with
some new functionality so let's take a
look
here I am inside of my application and I
have a typical method here that says get
monkeys async this is going to go off to
the internet pull down the data and then
deserialize it and return it into my
list I can see here that it's not doing
any checking at all to connect and look
at the internet so let's maybe see if
there's a way that GitHub co-pilot could
help me create a method to check the
internet uh before we make this call so
I'm just going to write a little comment
here that says method to check for
internet connection and when I hit enter
here it's going to give me a full
completion recommendation that says
connectivity.network access if it equals
internet now this is really cool because
GitHub copilot has the context of my
code we can see that this is an eye
connectivity instance a private uh
property somewhere in my code let's take
a look oh sure enough here it is this is
being directly injected into my
Constructor right here of icon activity
so this is nice because like I said
GitHub co-pilot knows about my code so
it's using that automatically here well
let's go ahead and actually use it so I
can now come in and say Let's uh check
for internet connection and display a
pop-up alert uh if no internet exists
in there now again GitHub uh copilot
will check that brand new method that it
calls that is connected property there
and then it will go ahead and display an
alert using shell because I'm using
shell in my application insurance office
says error no internet connection and
returns automatically for me so that's
really nice GitHub copilot not only
knows the contacts but it's adding new
methods it's helping me write better
code and is using everything it knows
about my application to make sure that
code is really great now of course I can
edit this add more contacts maybe add in
some different translations as well if I
have those in my application let's see
what else GitHub copilot and GitHub
copilot chat can do inside my
application
I'm going to take a look at the main
page here and this is a fairly complex
page it has a refreshed view it has a
collection view it has different item
templates and we can see here that
there's a tap gesture recognizer inside
of this Frame that will navigate to a
new page now this is a pretty complex
data binding there's a relative source
with an ancestor type and has a path and
if I'm brand new to xaml and mbvm this
might look pretty complex to me
especially if I'm coming into a project
for the first time this is where GitHub
co-pilot chat can really help me out
here I'm just going to go ahead and say
ask copilot I'm going to say uh what
does this relative Source
binding do and how does it work
so again GitHub co-pilot chat is now
going to kick in and this is really
great it's giving me information
not only on what a relative Source
binding is but what the ancestor type is
how it's going to go find the monkey's
view model class and then in this case
use the go to details command which is
found in that view model so that's
really nice and it asked me uh if I have
any other follow-up questions here but
I'm interested in this command parameter
so let's continue the conversation
so I'm going to say how does the command
parameter
work
work here
so again GitHub co-pilot chat is going
to go off and analyze my code and this
is really great it's going to say that
this command parameter is bound to the
dot which means it's going to pass in
the current item context in this case a
monkey inside of this tab gesture
recognizer so that's really really great
so if we take a look at the running
application over here
we can note that I have some monkeys in
here we can see that that's how that
data binding is working so that monkey
in that class but we can see that um in
this case the the labels are not
necessarily aligned correctly so let's
go ahead and tap on that and take a look
here
while we have this vertical stack layout
and some labels in here and I might be
wondering how could I maybe align that
vertically in here again let me just go
ahead and ask GitHub co-pilot how could
I align the content of the vertical
stack layout so they are centered
all right
again GitHub copilot chat over here is
going to analyze this code and recommend
some brand new code for me so it has the
exact same code but it's it's adding
this vertical Center and a line option
so let's go ahead and just copy that so
I could copy the whole thing I'm just
going to add this in here there we go
and now let's go ahead and see a look up
and sure enough now our labels are
vertically aligned so that's really
great so it's giving me that context
that understands it more so GitHub
co-pilot not only giving me some great
recommendations of learning about the
code but also how to enhance the code
well you know if I am coming in I'm
adding new features to this app I might
want to go ahead and create a new page
to navigate to the details of those
monkeys and again this is where GitHub
co-pilot chat and GitHub copile can
really help me out by creating and
giving me some some sort of templates
here for this type of page and even the
code behind so let's go ahead and ask
GitHub co-pilot chat I'll say how would
I create a net Maui xaml page for the
details of the monkey win selected
all right so let's see what a GitHub
co-pilot chat has to say here so again
it's going to analyze uh the application
and wow just like this it gives me a
full reference here
that is going to go ahead and give me
context of my large labels my medium
labels it's going to go ahead and bind
here to the name image location
automatically and even give me a go back
command which is nice now I could take
this I could copy this into a new page
but I could also ask it what type of
view model code could be generated for
the code behind here so let's go ahead
and ask it what would a view model code
behind look like for this new page
all right so now GitHub copilot is kind
of using that reference there and here
we go it is generated the monkey detail
view model for me and it's passing in a
monkey it has some information about
getting that different detail
information back for me and it's even
generated a command a go back command to
navigate backwards what I do like about
this is that it's also implemented my
base view model up here which is really
really cool because it knows about the
context of my code so if I look at this
monkey's view model again the main one
that I was working in we can also see
that it has the base view model there
too so that's really really nice now
this is great because this is giving me
some of that inside knowledge of what my
code looks like and giving me a good
starting place so I can take it put it
into my code and then start from there
to not only have a page but also the
code behind for it as well well that's
how easy it is to get started using
GitHub copilot and GitHub copilot chat
in your.net Maui applications today I
hope that you really enjoyed this leave

hi this is dr speaker from team mbs
counter
so now we have our all india rank 8 dr
swatha from
malaria kuwait
okay an intern so we'll have some chit
chat with her and
i'll let you know what are the secrets
of our preparation so that is going to
help you out okay so hi swapper okay
first of all congratulations for this
great achievement first of all uh the
most important thing here is till the
date uh from the day the need has
started till the date the language has
not achieved rank 50 below
or a single digit till the date i don't
know about the rest of the states but uh
this year you
you have you have got it and you have
proved it okay telangana people were in
the list of 50. so we are very very
happy for breaking this record and
hopefully your next badge next juniors
you have given a great hope for them so
they're working so hard with all the
energy whatever you have given so
uh so what are your uh i mean like what
what is your open suggestion for all all
your juniors that's the first question
all the telangana students are all the
interns who are preparing what is your
open suggestion for all of these people
first firstly they have to decide what
they want
some sometimes they they will be in a
dilemma that whether to go to abroad or
stay here they have to decide whether to
stay here or go to abroad then if they
want to stay here they have they have to
think what what is the next step if they
want really want to do mds and stay in
india
they have they have to write the
entrance exam so they have to decide
first they have to make a decision
whether they want to do mds or not they
have to fix their goal
and and they have to
take the steps for reaching their goals
the first suggestion is decide whether
you want to do mds or not if you are
planning to do give hundred percentage
shots okay so that's that's an
extraordinary suggestion because even in
during the interaction also i'll start
with this only whether you want to go
there whether you want to stay here if
you want to stay here m days is
mandatory and give your bed show that's
a perfect call what you have taken so
what is your like coming to the uh like
your preparation
what type of student is sveta from uh
from the intermediate okay let's not
talk about the schooling so how how good
student you are like more focused on uh
the reading part and everything like are
you uh i mean like are you like
there will be some every batch has that
five
five star students will be there are you
in that list or
i was a good student you were a good
student from intermediate yes from first
videos and everything yes a good student
who is more focused on preparation from
day one
okay
yeah so what are your suggestions
for the people who are thinking of who
are planning to start
their preparation
from the videos itself any any year like
first videos or second third or fourth
videos and
what are
your feedbacks about your preparation in
the first four years that has made your
preparation good and smooth in the
internship
this
during the videos will not will not read
text some people are there they will not
read the textbooks and during the last
phase of preparation like before 30 days
or before 45 days they will read all in
ones in our college
in most of the colleges
i suggest them to read textbooks
from the day one i used to read the
textbooks i don't prefer all in ones
that's the exact that is that is the
suggestion that you are going to give
further i want them to read from the
textbooks not like all events question
to question answer to answer if they
read the topic
it will be your
suggesting them to read a standard
textbook and prepare notes yeah so that
it will be easy for them to read and
this is going to add a good foundation
for
them in the internship preparation that
is what you're suggesting and that is an
extra edge for you what you have done is
it's an extra edge for you that has
helped your preparation to go in a
smoother way have you used all those
written notes any time during the
preparation phase of internship during
the preparation i used mds
material but you have not referred all
these things but sometimes when i when i
have doubts in some i used to refer but
your concepts are good in the first four
years that made the preparation smooth
indirectly okay
so
the next one is
i mean like
you are from a college where the op is
good decent enough okay how you manage
that like uh you told me that you need
to travel every day on the bus
how how how much is the travel distance
for you i mean traveling hovers for you
every day on the bus one and a half
hours are going and coming one and a
half hours so it's almost like three
apart from college time you have three
hours of birth journey every day right
this is right so this is so tricky like
in a metropolitan city like hyderabad
the pollution will be more traveling on
a bus for one and half hour it's going
to be you you're so tired i feel like
once you reach the home how you manage
this make to achieve this rank how you
manage this internship on one side op on
the other side traveling bus is one of
the tricky thing that other side and how
you manage all these things here
if you want to read something you have
to fix in mind i have to read
that will be there in my mind
after after reaching home
six
at six i'll reach the home six pm
and six to six thirty i'll take a break
from 6 30 to 8 30 i'll do two hours just
two hours i lead at home
in the morning i'll lead in bus and not
like reading i used to see the group
discussions which have which are done
and
refer smart videos if if the time per
time so in the bus journey also you used
to use the time in the most effective
way in your possibilities yeah but what
about your
preparation time and everything within
the college sometimes you may not have a
case so how you you used to read in
college also yes sir i used to read two
to three hours i used to read in the
past if there is no
non-clinical subjects i used to read in
college and what is your support from
your batchmates like your co-batchmates
will be there are they very supportive
or they used to come and disturb your
website so they are very supportive if
if i prepare some notes they used to ask
me questions and like that group
discussions everything used to happen
and how about the college because
within the college there will be lots of
things that going to increase your
preparation and
to your preparation on other side do you
have any such difficulties because
encouragement of course will read so
what about the odd ones that you face in
the college which always force you to
pull your legs to move away from your
preparation have you faced any such
things and have you overcome that if it
is yes some people will say she's
showing off
she's overreacting she's doing that they
will see
but we have to neglect that
so you ignore them and you focus what
you are doing for that's your suggestion
for
do you have you have faced such issues
from
from the co-aspirants or from the staff
or
not staff
my batchmates only used to say this
but okay that's it you have given a
perfect answer to all of those people on
the day of prison okay that's a good
thing
so i mean like if you want to rate the
top three things that you have done
which made you to achieve this rank what
are the top three things that you have
done
the best things which i mean like on the
day of result i mean you're a good
student on the day of exam and on the
day of result you feel like okay this
this is good it's going good what are
the three things that made this to
happen smart videos obviously smart
videos are there next
mock exams
and third group discussions so you want
to work your sequences smart videos
followed by mock exams followed by group
the combination of these things
has made to sit here this is what you
owed for okay that's good see see what
what the toppers are telling please try
to read our main focus
is always
to push you to the success so that's
that's what we do all these things okay
so i mean like this is a long journey
very long journey because
i was also bored of you both of you guys
keep on repeating the same subject keep
on discussing the same diagram it is so
tricky but my motto is always like
i want you to send to the examination
hall with a positive mind that's what we
we work on so this is a long journey of
18 months so much of bonding between the
mentors and everything
so how you maintain the consistency
these up and downs uh covet waves
scholars op you have your personal stuff
from the family
and
exam being postponed pre-bonded lots of
things are happening even
five days before exam also there were
some
pics that are being posted in your
telegram groups and so many of your
calling so the exam will be postponed
people are telling it's postponed right
social media has lots of impact how do
you overcome all this social media and
all
negative in this 18 months long journey
18 months is a very long journey
there are some
breaks in my preparation not long breaks
okay like two three days like that you
should have patience
patience and hope stay calm and focus on
what you're doing simple tagline
yeah that's what like i i also regularly
see students
with i mean most of the toppers or most
of the toppers i see like the creamy 50
below 100
they were very cool and composed they
don't overreact to the situation they
know what they're doing they just focus
on this is what quality i used to see
and definitely i can what i have i have
been like after talking to you from the
last few days and i am able to see the
same quality that what these people have
had previously like there are few
students
who all react for everything
examples funded ah exemplary point they
have pain even if it is postponed pre
pointed everything even a notification
is coming they have a problem they will
take two days off
so i feel like overreacting should not
be there cool and compost focus on what
you're doing is the best mantra for the
preparations
all right so i mean this 18 months if i
if i divide your 18 months preparation
into
a b c i mean early phase mid phase and
phase
which phase of your preparation has an
impact on your rank
last three months last three months you
work like hell yes how many hours 14 to
15 14 to 15 hours no other navigations
complete focus on preparations how about
your uh initial and mid phase initial
phase i was like
i'll read daily but i i used to read
like two hours one hour no what made you
like for example initial face you're
cool you're calm okay let's go but why
you are like more forced uh in the last
phase of preparation like what made you
to do that why why you're forced to do
heavy heavy jobs in the last phase not
in the initial
first and midfield do you have any
strategy that okay i have to go slow
then hit the high then go for the peaks
you have any strategy if if you were
like doing
if you are too stressful in the initial
phase you will lose that
due to stress you can't you can't reach
you you can't continue to read maintain
the same same consistency with the high
levels of preparation yes okay if you
read only if you start reading for 15
days you start eating for one hour then
after 15 days you can increase to two
hours like that you can increase so
incremental mode of increasing the time
you suggest for the people yes that's
right absolutely right if you
stress in the initial faces you lose the
confidence and you will feel more
stressful then you can't take
so you can increase the timings when you
are adapted to it when you are adapted
to reading you can increase the time
okay so what you do in the first half of
the preparation like i mean like i'm
just asking you do more mcqs in the
first half or you do more mcqs in the
second half second half i'd i didn't
know
first half what do you focus on smart
videos and all this i focused on only
smart videos i prepared good notes of
out of it
during division that notes will be very
easy
okay so if you focus on
pulse solving mcqs in the first first
half without knowing any basics
there will it will be
so much stressful and you'll lose your
confidence yes it's difficult for you to
remember
the concepts is not what i suggest so
that is if you know the basic you can
solve many mcqs you can solve any sort
of mcqs apart from the original mcq
that's that's very good
and what is your mantra for the last 15
days of the preparation
15 days what you have done in the last
15 days 15 days it's very confused what
to be done
of course we are there to support you
but what you have done in the last 15
days
mock exams and notes
so you you stick on to your notes what
you have prepared and what and mock
exams you have revised
a number of times and what are your
scores in the mock exams your average
score in the mock exam
i don't want highest and lowest
roughly sir 20 plus or minus this is my
average score and 20 more questions what
is you feel your average score in the 20
market stops
700 700. what is your final exam score
761. so you got more than
i mean you got almost the same scores
what you used to achieve here in the box
okay so i mean like after this long
journey and this great achievement okay
so
what a dental student requires
what a dental student requires basically
maybe
first year okay lots of immaturity will
be there second year immediately will be
the third year partially we are
mentioned enough finally we are on track
so at these different phases what
suggestion you want to give to become a
good student like you you told that i am
a very good student from the bds first
year so there are few people who really
want to be so what suggestion you want
to give for these people
i'm not a great i'm not an extraordinary
student so i cannot suggest them so you
you proved that you are in a good
student so any suggestions for these
people who has
some hope on dentistry
start dentistry well i'm not bothered
about fine layers or interns i'm more
bothered about these young kids so what
are your suggestions for these and kids
first i used to listen to the classes
which are going on i i was like when i
read i can't remember things clearly but
when i listen to it i'll remember more
so listening to the classes is important
after that reading from the standard
textbooks is important so don't bunk the
classes read from standard textbooks you
you're indirectly telling that
avoid that xyz books where uh your
question answer all in one question
answers will be there so
i mean like if if we read from that
we'll only know that question and answer
we
we can't read the entire concept from
that so i suggest
yeah
and uh how do you manage pb books have
you done pp books in the second round or
you have focus p books on the last phase
or from the day when you have started pp
books
from in the middle i asked in the middle
you have started pp books have you done
it perfectly
yes sir i have reversed them three times
three times revision
are important according to me during
division also yeah those are those those
books are going to help you out
okay so is there any impact of your
ini ced rank on your need because
telangana students it's an open secret
because i am being with telangana
students
from very long time so
telangana students are not much
interested in this cyanide cdt format
they don't read even i force them they
don't read
openly to say they don't even apply for
that really leave about a
reading they don't apply the exam even
after telling hundred times over there
but you have given the exam so what is
the impact of this
inict preparation or the result on your
knee track
i didn't prepare much
before the injection i took leave like
one week
and i wrote the exam
but this gave me more confidence
what's your rank in inside 144 records
you got 140 for all india rank and that
has given you a hope that you will be in
and around this
in the net so
what are your suggestions because okay
this year
fortunately
people are not eligible for number
ionizability but there are other people
of mds conquer many viewers who are
watching this video they are eligible
for this exam okay what are your
suggestions for inicit
number they are going to give any 50
percentage of the people definitely give
just for a practice but the result of
this will have an impact on the exam
so what is what is your suggestion for
example
you got a good rank if you get a bad
rank how you are going to pop up
i'll read more i'll think that i am
below the level and have to reach that
level to get down so that's a very good
suggestion and if you get a good rank
how you manage this like 144 is a good
rank how you manage that how you have
taken that
i have taken like i have to get 100
below rank if it is 144 what what i have
to do to get 100 below rank in it okay
so that that quality is important like
an exam is going to tell you where you
are standing in the preparation
and by knowing
where you're standing that can be a mock
exam that can be a daily exam that can
be a grand exam it's going to tell you
where you are at so take it as a
positive way whether you have to improve
with your competitor or whether you have
to maintain the same confidence levels
it doesn't mean a rank or a number is
going to degrade your preparation or
demotivate your profession because i
have seen so many of you you feel very
bad getting bad scores getting bad score
means it is telling that you have to
work hard to get a good score so take it
as take it take everything as a positive
way okay right so
how many questions you have attempted in
uh
nate
neet
2139 239 is
a huge number inici 80 200 out of 200
how many questions you attempted um
140 140 140 and there it's less setup
here it is the more like are you very
confident about the question paper out
of 240 neat
yes sir i was so confident but some
mistakes are there like
similar options i was i was confused
but the questions were like
familiar
i was familiar with all the questions
that i i thought like oh i
fully question paper i know the full
question yeah you are so comfortable
with the question pepper maybe the
reason what i feel is
more number of mocks maybe more number
of mocks made you more comfortable after
giving 25 mock exams
of course you are giving one more
examiner you will be more comfortable
like that's what like giving mock exams
seriously revising them properly is a
very very important thing that most of
you people have done to
to stay here okay
so
apart from this coming to part a part b
inic you don't have all these the party
part we don't have but need you have
party or part b what are your comments
about party a part b and means not in
the exam not about this exam your
preparation about party apartment like
basic subjects particularly pharma
general medicine physio
how you have done have you achieved
uh the things in the examination hall
you feel like okay i have done good
because most of the people
from many years i am seeing they have
phobia to the medicine pharma physio one
thing
most of uh the coaching centers or xyz
said we we don't
teach up to the mark is one comment that
what i used to have in my mind during my
preparation
and
we worked so hard as a team okay to
provide you the best stuff for this the
three combination of subjects and even
last year also i was talking to most of
the students they have phobia towards
these three or four subjects what are
your comments about these subjects how
you managed it
have you really overcome that fear after
giving the exam how you like yes a part
i felt like party was more easy than
partying easies i have highlighted one
you're confident about partying before
going to the exam yes you're confident
you have done everything revision
what you say like a revision in the last
15 days should be more for party or
partly
for party it is more important more
important anatomy
physiology
pharmacology general medicine further
division is more depression is more
important
and during your preparation phase
it was like a lengthy preparation phase
every 10 days or 15 days you're going to
have an exam on a particular subject
how you used to you used to give exams
on time
at first i didn't give long time but on
on the process
how your scores choose to be on what's
your rank in mds conquer youtube after
you start giving your grand grand exam
grand exam on each subject for example
dental anatomy on exam will be there
what your scores used to be like rank
and scores used
i don't use to concentrate on that no i
don't even know because i feel like now
students if they get a rank of 30 or 40
they lose the hopes
no sir first i gave exam and frost i got
30 rank 30 then auto i got 18 grand okay
so it's slow improvement is there
finally under the best rank from mds
market
so suggestions for the people
who are not able to perform well
in the first few months of the
preparation what are your suggestions
how your first few months of the
preparation is there and what are your
suggestions for the people who are not
able to reach
for example i i see these these young
generation people they read 10 days they
read 15 days and they decide what they
rank in the final exam they feel like
comfortable they read if not they'll
quit the preparation again these people
after quitting preparation they'll come
in the last three months to rejoin the
preparation again this is the most
common uh area where
your uh your batch i mean like your
crowd your generation crowd into
industries is losing the hopes what are
your suggestions for these people
i think the preparation should be
continuous
it doesn't depend on the number of
hearts you read but it should be
continuous some days you read 10 hours
some days you can read five hours but it
should be continuous if you give like
one week break
you can you can't cope up with the
studies you lose the interest
consistency is important yes good scores
bad scores consistency is important good
day bad day consistency is important so
consistency plays a major major role yes
perfect and
like for example
uh you're being posted in a particular
department where the op is high you are
stressed going back home in the
in the bus and everything you're
stressed
so what are your suggestions for that
particular month you are posted in indo
you have more op you are posted in omr
you will have more hope
so how you manage that particular month
i may not complete the given schedule
fill
but i i used to read the i used to see
the watch the smart videos i used to
prepare the notes if there are any
backlogs
i used to complete in the weekends
first
in that subject i used to complete the
smart videos your task is to complete
the smart videos first because that's
going to add the core concepts yes once
your core concepts are ready
whatever you want to do whenever you
want to do you can do them sequence this
is your this is your secret right and
how do you manage this saturday is
saturday half day for your full day
full day
how do you manage these sundays and
public holidays how you use them like
daily you said like four or five hours
is a maximum for me according to you uh
maybe two hours in the college one one
and a half hour on the bus and followed
by two to three hours in the home
maximum it is four to five hours but
what is your what is your greatest
weapon is sunday is the greatest weapon
for you
sunday i used to read like nine to ten
hours nine to ten minimum nine to ten
hours and how do you manage the stress
for lunch finish the breakfast catch the
bus get into college face all these
people have the lunch come back again in
hyderabad
at home by 5 5 5 5 30 again preparing
your family our family will have some
personal issues going in the family how
do you manage all these things 18 18
months and you made an eighth rank
friends
and voices friends are your stress
breakers you don't watch movies
you watch movies you go out
i don't go out i used to watch movies
and series okay so for you you have good
friends who break your stress yes okay
very good and the voice notes also voice
notes of conquer has motivated you right
so
what made you to choose mds conquer
there was a senior in my college
similar circumstances
she got a 500 rank last year last year
okay she told you have discussed with
her yes and then she
become suggested
it's good
and how how how about uh have you have
you had a word with your juniors in the
last few days any of your juniors has
called you ma'am yes what is mantra what
is this your batchmates anyone you got
so many calls uh two three members they
asked me so okay so what are what are
your suggestions for all your juniors
not only from your college throughout
the country
being an intern getting a single visit
is something more than waw farmer
repeaters of course they sit read focus
they do all these things because they
have full length
but you have a tricky job to handle the
internship one side stay in the home
traveling and everything
and 18 months preparation you end up
with a single visit so what are your
suggestions
for this intense as well as for the
repeaters what what things
they should keep in mind about
preparation
they have to be focused but
they should not stress much they should
not take too much stress
whatever they can read they can lead in
that limited time
if they want to extend their preparation
they can take breaks from the college
like two you have in a week you can take
one break you have taken the bricks
whenever it is possible whenever it is
possible i i took it okay so what what
are your
material of preparation because we see
when we talk with the
people who end up with good ranks okay
they are going to talk a lot lots of
things about i have done this book i
have done that book you have to read
text books you have to do this you have
to do that
what about your list of things that you
have done
i read
pp books from conquer dental pulse
and and the notes which have prepared
from the smart videos that's all nothing
more than this we have so many books for
each and every subject have you touched
those books no sir no during the last
phase when i when i get any doubt i used
to refer textbooks and for diagrams i
used to
refer
that's all not more than this not more
than heavy high five books because most
of the mentors they ask the students to
do the medical books for the a party a
so i mean like i don't oppose that i
also suggest some medical books for the
repeaters not exclusively for interns
but you can keep your preparation within
your limitations and you also can end up
with your with a rank with a very good
rank uh keeping limited number of books
do you suggest more number of books or
do you suggest limited books with more
rounds of revision
limited books with more revisions more
revision is required
if you read so many books you will be
confused what to revise what to read in
the last phase so
limited syllabus
you can revise it more times and you can
remember
that's wonderful
yes i'm done from my side so i'm very
happy uh

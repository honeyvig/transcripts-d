so what is Scrum methodology scrum
methodology is an agile project
management framework that emphasizes
collaboration iterative progress and
adaptability teams using scrum work in
short Cycles called Sprints to deliver
parts of a project scrum is based on
transparency inspection and adaptation
allowing teams to learn from each other
and adjust their approach as they go
here's how it works in simple terms
roles there are three main roles the
product owner who makes sure the work is
valuable the scrum master who helps the
team follow scrum and the team members
who do the work after that product
backlog this is a list of all the work
or features that need to be done then
there is Sprints the team picks a small
chunk of work from the backlog and
commits to completing it within a Sprint
next is daily standup every day the team
meets quickly to update each other on
their progress next one is Sprint review
at the end of the Sprint the team shows
what they've completed completed after
that Sprint retrospective the team
discusses what went well what didn't and
how they can improve for the next Sprint
it's all about delivering valuable work
frequently and efficiently with everyone
on the team having a clear role and
working closely together this was about
scrum methodology now let's understand
about product owner product owner is a
key role responsible for representing
the customer needs and ensuring the team
builds the right product they prior
prioritize tasks Define features and
make decisions about what the team
should work on next essentially they act
as the voice of the customer within the
development process guiding the team to
create a product that meets user
requirements and delivers value they
collaborate closely with a scrum team
consisting of developers and a scrum
Master to ensure that the team focuses
on delivering features that provide the
most value to the customer so as we have
understood about the scrum methodology

owner serves as the voice of the
stakeholders within the scrum team they
gather and represent stakeholder needs
and ensure those needs are reflected in

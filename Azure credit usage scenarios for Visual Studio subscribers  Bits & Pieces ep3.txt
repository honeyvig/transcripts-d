(upbeat vocalizing music)
- Hello everyone,
and welcome to another
episode of "Bits & Pieces."
This is a series for
Visual Studio subscribers.
And I wanna thank you
for joining us today.
I'm your host, April Edwards.
And just like you, I'm a
developer, and I work for GitHub.
Now, as part of my job, I
wanna know what tools I can use
to help me develop
applications more effectively.
Now, to set expectations
in today's episode,
we're briefly gonna give you an overview
of the monthly Azure credit
and what it can be used for.
Now, Visual Studio Subscriptions has
an Azure monthly credits,
which are included
if you're a paid volume
licensing subscriber,
or you have a retail Visual
Studio Enterprise subscription,
or even a Professional
or a Test Professional,
and even the MSDN platform subscriptions.
Now, some of the other
programs or channels,
like MPM, MCT, MPSA, and
BizSpark, also have Azure credits.
And kudos to you
if you know exactly what
those acronyms stood for,
because I don't.
So here's the basic breakdown
of how much monthly
Azure credit is included
with each of those subscription types.
So if you're a Visual Studio
Enterprise subscriber,
you're gonna have 150
US dollars per month.
If you're a Visual Studio Professional
or Test Professional subscriber,
you're gonna have 50 US dollars per month.
Now, if you're an MSDN's
platform subscription subscriber,
you're gonna have 100
US dollars per month.
So these credits are part
of your subscription,
and automatically renew
every single month.
So you don't have to put down
a credit card to get going.
It's pretty easy.
Now, in case you do exhaust
your credit, which does happen,
these services will
shut off automatically,
not incurring you any further charges.
So if you don't know what
subscription level you have,
or which program you have access to,
you can go to subscriptions
page in your portal
by visiting
my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions.
So to help me today,
I'd like to introduce our very
special guest, Javier Lozano.
Hey, Javier.
- Hey, April. How's it going?
- I'm doing well, man.
It's good to see you.
- I know.
Thank you very much for
having me on the show.
This is really exciting,
and can't wait to talk to you
about all the awesomeness of
Visual Studio subscriptions.
- Me either.
And, you know, before we get started,
I mean, you and I know each
other, like, super well.
We're pretty much biffles.
Can you tell everyone
else out there who you are
and what is you do?
- Yes, like April said,
my name is Javier Lozano.
I'm a Microsoft MVP,
which stands for most
valuable professional.
I spend a lot of time of
giving back to the community,
so in particularly in the .NET space.
So I'm a .NET developer,
primarily in ASP.NET.
I live in the middle of the US in Iowa.
So I actually have an Azure
data center close to my house,
which is great.
- That's awesome.
But first and foremost, I wanna
thank you for being an MVP,
'cause the hard work you put
into the community is amazing.
And I know there are tons of
MVPs out there watching today.
And thank each and every one of you,
'cause your contributions
help make what we do
at GitHub and Microsoft so much better.
So, thank you.
- Yep.
- Alright, so, we wanna talk
about Azure credits today.
So I'm gonna let you get started.
- Yep.
So let's go take a look
at the Azure Portal,
and we can go from here.
So for this specific situation,
like this conversation,
is I wanted, I created a simple,
a different resources
out in the Azure Portal
that I kind of wanna talk through
and highlight as we go along.
So now, I have the Visual
Studio Enterprise subscription.
That means that I have $150
that I can reuse month to month.
Now, I have barely am able
to tap into those $150,
because there's a lot of
free resources out there
within Azure that I can play with
and get an understanding
of how to use them, so.
- So we can work smarter, not harder, and-
- Right, exactly.
- I like that. I like that.
- Yep. Yep.
I think my average Azure bill is
about 55 US dollars a month.
So I'm barely tapping into it,
and I have things running
out there full time.
So it allows you, depending
on what kind of development
or kinda proof of concept
things you want to do,
it is great way to get to dip your toe
into the Azure services.
- Awesome.
Now, I'm based in the UK,
so they convert that
150 US dollars a month
to British Pound, GBP.
And so, for those of
you in other countries,
they'll convert that
to your local currency.
So you'll see whatever
the local currency is
in the Azure Portal,
and you'll get that currency
in your monthly allowance every month.
- Right, and there's a
way there, right now,
I don't have it set up
in the dashboard here,
we just have the plain
old view of the resources,
but you can actually drop
widgets in a dashboard,
and it will tell you,
"Hey, you have this, you've
consumed this many credits."
Or you can say,
"Hey, you have this many
credits left in your monthly."
So it allows you to,
if you're doing a lot of playing
around with those credits,
you sort of know where
you're at and at the level
when you go around.
- Awesome.
So you can keep track of it.
You can also put spending
limits, all that good stuff.
So, I want to know,
what kind of usage
scenarios can we get into?
Like, what are the most
cost-effective ways to get started?
And I know you're a .NET developer.
I'm more kind of like cloud native,
working with serverless and all that,
but let's start with some
kind of cloud scenarios
that we can get started with in Azure.
- So the scenario that works the best
for both being a .NET
developer or a web developer
and cloud native developer
is something called an App Service, okay?
And the App Service,
essentially it is a way
to carve out a website
out in Azure that,
and Azure does all the managing for you,
because it's platform as
a service, which is great.
So, let me bring that
up here in the portal.
So I'm gonna go through to
the hamburger menu up here
and say create resource.
I'm gonna look for App Service.
And when you look for App Service,
there's several things
that sort of come up here.
There is a App Service environment,
App Service plan, and web app, okay?
The big thing to realize here is
that even though we're
talking about an App Service,
like here, we're actually talking
about an App Service plan.
That's the thing that you pay for.
And the plan is great,
because you're literally
are carving out a server
of a certain size out there for you,
and that's what the
credits are being used for.
- So paying for compute
on someone else's machine.
- Correct.
And the nice thing about it is, like,
you can put as many websites as you want
as that compute instance that
you carved out can handle.
So if you have six websites
that you wanna try out
and have them each do different things,
it's not like, oh, I have to
pay for each individual one.
No, you're paying for the plan,
and the plan is spread out
across all those instances.
- Awesome.
- So, great.
So, if we go and kind of look at that,
one of the things that we can do
if I create an App Service
is pretty straightforward.
So the entire portals steps
you through the wizard.
So you can say, "I have my
Visual Studio subscription here."
That's the number of my subscription.
I have the Bits and Pieces resource group.
And then I can start picking
and choosing the settings that I want.
For example, I can call
it "bitsandpiecesapp",
and it will validate that it's there,
and I can select, yep,
I'm gonna make this a .NET
6 app or a .NET 7 app.
You know, I can pick whichever I want to.
And I'm, as I mentioned,
I do have a data center close to me,
and I'm gonna pick US Central.
Actually, Central US.
There it is.
And from here,
this is where you can start picking
and choosing the size of
that App Service plan.
So you have the option of
creating a brand new one,
or creating an existing one,
depending on what sort
of where you wanna go.
- Okay.
And I can see you have,
your pricing plan has the
total amount of consumption,
so, RAM and CPU.
- Right, it has it, yep.
So if you were, if we were to click here,
this is where it,
and by the way, I've been
using Azure for a long time.
This is by far the best
way of looking at the data,
because it just tells you
specifically what you're getting,
what is the virtual CPUs, right,
what's the memory, what's the storage,
and how many instances
you can scale each individual website to,
and you see the price on the right.
- Awesome.
- Which is awesome. Yep.
So then you can say,
"Hey, you know what, for
my $150, I can go as,"
and believe it or not,
Azure is phenomenal when it
comes to cost for hosting.
You can get a Premium v3, PV3,
which essentially has 4 gigs of memory
and 250 gigabyte storage.
And you can go up higher,
depending on what kind of
workloads that you foresee having
with your applications.
But the sky's the limit.
You can spend as much as you want on it,
and obviously with your credit,
you will be consuming, like you said,
to that specific point,
and then the App Service plan will stop.
- Perfect. Awesome.
So yeah, so we can build a
website, host our webpages,
and we could use a basic plan,
we could use a simple plan,
even a premium plan that's
pretty cost effective.
- Yep. Yep.
From my perspective,
the Visual Studio
Subscription is a great way
to kick the tires around with Azure,
especially if you work in an
enterprise that has Azure.
You can figure out, hey, here's what,
how I actually configure an App Service.
Because you may, you
as a developer, right,
or front-end worker may not
be doing that day-to-day.
Someone in your IT back
office could do it.
And it's great, so that way,
you can have that conversation
with them and figure out,
oh, we should do X, we should do Y.
- Absolutely, and work together as a team.
So, what if I have a database?
'Cause I'll be honest,
a lot of my websites have
databases attached to them.
How do we handle that?
- That's a great question.
So, just like we did with that,
we can go back to "Create a resource"
and we can search for SQL Database.
Now, SQL Database is
essentially a hosted instance
of SQL Server-like functionality.
It's not SQL Server per se,
because it's totally different, right?
But it's essentially a platform
as a service SQL Server.
And one of the things that you can do,
and similar to here, I'll go ahead create,
and I'll create a SQL Database,
is you can cherry pick the
different type of resources
that you can do.
Now, this is a little bit different
from this type of wizard,
because there's an option here
where it talks about want to
try SQL Database for free.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, so there are tool tips
that you can easily go through
and select the different
types of cores that you want.
So in this screen, we
can create a database,
just like we can with the
other wizards in within Azure.
One of the things to note
here is the price is estimated
at $272 per month, right?
So that's more than our credit.
But there's a service, there's an offer,
what you can see here,
where we can apply and get
SQL Azure Database for free.
- Awesome.
- The way we are able to
trigger something like this is
that we have to go and change
the workload environment
from production to development
because we're in a subscription.
So we're not in a actual
production Azure subscription.
- Right, correct.
- So, by switching the
workload environment,
now we can see that the price
has significantly dropped.
Right, so it's now much,
much more affordable,
even with our credit.
So now we apply the offer.
We can see
that we now have the database
running completely for free.
- Awesome.
That's a really cool trick,
because databases are expensive.
Storing data's expensive.
So that's really, really cool.
So Javier, that's awesome. I love that.
I love, I mean, I've
seen the discount before.
I've never seen the free
offer for the free database.
- Right, in particular, since
it's 32 gigabytes of data.
I mean, I have production
subscriptions out there
that are paying for 200, you
know, gigabytes and so forth,
and the price goes up.
So for 32 gigabytes, kick the
tires with Azure SQL Database.
It's amazing.
- That's awesome. That's really cool.
So, that was awesome to see
Azure Web Apps with databases.
That's a really huge use case,
getting started with Azure, right,
moving web applications over.
We can containerize and we can
do all sorts of stuff there.
But I wanna talk about some
of the other free services.
What are some of the other
free ones that we have?
I have a few that I love,
but what's your favorite one?
- So, one of the ones
that I like the most,
which is ties there
directly to App Services,
is Azure Functions, right?
I'm not sure if you like Azure,
if you're a fan of Azure Functions or not.
- I love Azure Functions.
The reason why I love Azure Functions is
you can literally automate
anything with an Azure Function.
So you can use a timer trigger,
you can use an action or an event,
but they also connect to legacy systems.
So they're great in serverless
cloud native systems,
but then they're also great connecting
to maybe like an on-prem data
center or a legacy monolith,
where you're trying to just do
a thing or automate a thing.
I will automate so many
things with actions,
excuse me, with Azure Function apps.
And I believe on Azure Function apps,
your first million calls
to a function are free.
So they're not entirely free,
but if you're making, like,
a million calls a month, that's insane.
So let's look at some use
cases for Azure Functions,
'cause I think there's some
good enterprise use cases
and some good fun use cases.
- Yeah.
So ideally with an Azure Function,
it's kind of one of those settings
where you can easily set
it and forget it, right?
So, where you can say,
"Hey, behind the scenes,
I've received this request,"
for example, uploading a file, right?
So you have an API that you send the file,
and you wanna be able to say,
"Hey, I wanna be able to index this file,
change the name, do
something else with it."
You will then can trigger a function
after the upload is done
or after the file has been
saved to storage per se,
and it will pick it up
and it will do the work,
at that point,
it will be completely out of
band from what you're doing.
- So I actually used Azure
Functions in a customer product,
and it was very cost savings.
So they had a very
manual process happening
in their organization, and
they need to process data.
When I say data, images and videos.
And we use the function,
anytime an incoming image or
video came in, to process that,
and we chain them together.
Then there's things like
durable functions and logic apps
that you can hook it, obviously.
You can chain all these
serverless things together.
But the compute cost to the
customer was minimal every month
in a production environment,
'cause we could chain them.
But actually I have a favorite use case
for Functions I think
we should talk about.
- Oh, you do.
I think we talked about this before.
- We did.
And you know exactly where this is going.
And this is something I
haven't done in a while,
but with an Azure Function,
you can use sentiment analysis.
And you're thinking,
okay, why do I wanna know
what other people are
feeling and thinking?
Now, first use case is if
you own an organization,
or are trying to get
feedback off of people,
especially social media,
you can hook in sentiment
analysis from a function
that anytime someone does a
thing, you get that feedback.
So for instance,
I have potentially been
stranded at an airport,
and a specific airline just left me there,
and I sent an angry,
formerly tweet, now X
or whatever we call it,
and they picked up on
it and they responded.
And I love this, so I love
Twitter, well, we call,
it's still called the Twitter
Sentiment Analysis component,
but it, X, Twitter, whatever.
We have all these connectors
that are pre-baked into Function.
So Twitter's one of 'em.
So it's great if you wanna use a hashtag
and get the sentiment
anytime that hashtag's used.
And actually I use that
on one of the engineering
teams I worked on
to get product feedback from that product.
But it's also fun if, like,
you send a tweet or an X
or whatever we call it,
and you wanna get that
feedback from someone,
like, whether people liked
or disliked your post.
So I really like it.
I'm a big fan of the sentiment analysis.
- When you think about it, it
kind of shows you, you know,
'cause sentiment analysis just is
yet another Azure service, right?
It's part of, you know,
even though it says here
Azure Cognitive Services,
is now Azure AI Services,
because of recent rebranding, right?
But it kind of shows you,
like you were talking earlier,
how you can stitch the
different pieces together.
And the nice thing about it,
it's, A, not gonna break the bank,
B, you already have the credit,
and so you can pay for
those to that analysis
as the texts come in.
And the best part about this one is
that it's completely turnkey.
So you can just get it for
free, create the Functions,
it steps you through everything, right,
and it tells you specifically
what you need to configure
and where you can get the settings from.
How do you trigger it?
And it literally just runs for you.
And the best part about it,
if you go with a consumption level,
which means essentially
the function only runs when it's called,
rather than something
just sitting out there
and being in the background,
your cost and usage just literally drops.
- Yes, and it's practically free,
unless you hit those million calls.
And that's crazy.
Now, I know there's some other free things
we want to talk about,
but I actually wanna
touch on the AI piece,
'cause AI's a hot topic right now.
- It is.
- What are some of the other
AI features that we can use
in Azure with our credit?
- So that's a great question.
So another, some of the other
features that we can use,
and I'll come back to the Marketplace,
and I will say Create a resource,
if we look for Azure, Azure AI,
we can see all the different
things that we have out here.
So we can actually, this is,
and the nice thing about is
when you look at the Marketplace,
you can see other stuff
that comes up, right?
It may not be applicable
to your subscription,
because it's an extra cost,
'cause you need to have that
subscription with that vendor,
for example, like,
this Generative AI for
Software Developers.
That might be a third party thing
that you can align to and pay for.
But in particular here,
anything that you can do
with the Azure AI services,
which is, again, hosted and ran by Azure,
you can pretty much do whatever you want.
And you can pick the
different types of services
that you want.
You can pick the different pricing tiers.
You can look at what's out there.
But for example, one of the
cool ones that you can do is
that you can do computer vision.
- Ah, that's pretty cool.
- So, and I've actually used
computer vision several times,
where with working with clients,
where you can upload an image
and you can tell computer vision,
these are the type of
images that I am uploading.
For example, that could be a form
that you wanna be able to
parse to be able to know,
oh, this is a form X compared to form Y.
So as the images get uploaded,
and they get thrown into Azure storage,
the computer vision can look 'em up
and actually start sorting 'em
and provide metadata for you,
completely out of the box.
- Yes, and I've used this
before where we've, again,
processed images with tags, right?
We use tags to process the metadata.
And it was all done under
.NET Functions actually.
This is really cool.
So I love that.
And I think everyone's
looking how to use AI
to how do we collate our data,
how do we index it, how do we use it?
How do we do more with it?
So this is really good.
This is a really good usage scenario.
- And another thing, like, for example,
here you can also do the Video Indexer,
so, if you're uploading video,
so it's not just static content
such as an image, right?
But if you wanna able
to do an upload a video,
and able to understand what's
going on in that video,
and split it and get
that metadata out of it,
the AI is there to do it.
And the nice thing about it is
that you can scale it, right?
So as you saw on the other screen,
you can pick what's standard,
and you can say, "Hey,
I need more horsepower."
So, and then you can change that
after you've created the service.
- Awesome.
Now, I've used a lot of the
stuff with the serverless stuff.
We talked about Functions.
I wanna switch gears again,
and talk about another one
of my favorite services.
So, you talked about Azure Web Apps.
One of my favorite Azure features
is Azure Static Web Apps.
- Yes.
- So, because they're entirely free.
I mean, there's a paid-for
tier, but it's a free tier.
You can hook in your Functions to it.
You can hook an AI to it actually.
And it gives you a pretty good foundation
to build a Static Web App.
- Yep, it does. Yeah.
The nice thing about
Static Web Apps is that
that point is the sky is the limit, right?
So, say for example, you,
your company or you're playing around
with front-end development, right,
whether it be Blazor from
the .NET perspective,
Angular or React or whatever
those, whatever the content is,
you can actually tell and
deploy that application
as it sits, right, into
the Static Web Apps,
get 100 gigabits of bandwidth.
That is a lot of bandwidth.
- That is a lot of bandwidth.
- Per subscription, right, total.
Especially if you're just
playing around with it, right,
if you have an Angular app or a Blazor app
that you wanna throw out there.
You also get free domains
attached to it, which is great,
because that way you can say,
"Hey, I have my example .com, right,
or example .net URL's
gonna tie directly to it."
And those Static Web
Apps can call resources,
such as an Azure Function
behind the scenes,
to do whatever processing you want.
So, all in all, you can deploy
a very powerful application
on the free services very quickly.
- You just chain them all
together, effectively.
- Yes, exactly.
- Create your whole workflow,
which I think is awesome.
Now, when you deployed
your Azure Web App before,
you did it from the Portal,
which is fair, you know,
everyone likes to point
and click a little bit,
but I wanna talk about automation,
'cause I'm a big fan of
automating everything.
So when you deploy an
Azure Static Web App,
or even Azure Web App,
you have the ability to automate this
after you deploy it with either
GitHub and GitHub actions,
which we'll discuss another day,
but also things like Azure DevOps,
and Azure DevOps is free if
you use up to five users.
So you can automate all these deployments
with Azure DevOps hooked
into the Azure Portal.
- Right, and I already have.
I do use leverage quite a bit,
the free offering from Azure DevOps,
because it allows you essentially
have unlimited projects,
right, unlimited private GitHub
repo, I'm sorry, Git repos,
right, as compared with GitHub,
or, like, by default
they're public, right?
So there's a little bit different there.
And it allows you to use Azure Pipelines.
So you can either use the YAML pipelines
that you have out of the box,
or you can use what it's
called the classic pipelines,
which is like WYSIWYG, right?
So you're able to select,
click, and do those.
The same thing with releases.
You can do YAML based releases,
or you can do classic releases,
which is, again, it's more of a GUI based.
So in here, I'm just sort of showing,
here's some of the pipelines
that I've built in the past,
and these are mostly GUI-based ones,
and they're kinda old,
but they work, right?
And the nice thing about it
is that for what I'm doing
for deploying that simple app
into my Azure resources that,
sorry, for my free Azure
resources, this costs me nothing.
So not only do I have CICD for free,
I also have the Azure hosting
for free, which is great.
- That's awesome. I love that.
I think that that's a whole, I mean,
with Azure DevOps, you also have planning.
You have a repo.
You can put your code in there.
You don't have to pay for that.
You can do also things with, like,
test plans and your project as a whole.
So, that's awesome.
So we could literally
build out our, put our,
we have somewhere to put our code.
We have somewhere to deploy
it to with pretty much free,
if not mostly free with our credit.
That's awesome.
I think that's a really good
start for people out there.
All right?
So we can, let's see,
we have App Service plans with databases.
We have Azure Functions.
We have Azure Static
Web Apps, Azure DevOps,
and a lot of the AI services.
Is there anything else that we're missing
that we should tell people about?
- That's a good question.
You know, there's a
lot of different things
that you can go into
that obviously cognitive search
that you can get into in the AI pieces.
You can also get into storage.
And actually the thing that
people miss about is storage,
and storage is so cheap in Azure
that you don't even think about it,
'cause you just assume
that's always there.
It's kinda like RAM and CPU, right?
But all of these different services,
as you go and develop
and you start playing around
and kicking the tires,
you will realize that, oh,
I didn't know I could
do X or I could do Y.
And obviously your mileage will vary,
depending on the type of workloads
and the type of problems you're solving
in your organization.
- And there's a list, we will
put it in the description,
that has a list of just
all the Azure services
that you have access to that
are either free or discounted.
And actually, the list
shows all the free services.
So there's a lot of good stuff.
So we talked about CICD,
but you can throw in monitoring tools.
Azure Policy actually is free as well.
So you can do some checks and balances.
You could actually
practice what you would do
in a production environment
for pretty much nothing.
So, Javier, this is awesome.
This was great to see.
I love being able to see
the ways we can kind of like
really leverage our spending budget,
because I don't wanna go over
that 150 US dollars a month,
because I've done that.
I've accidentally gone over.
- Trust me, I've had
services that, you know,
out there that I'm like,
oh, I'm doing a demo.
I'm presenting in front of, you know,
doing my MVP duties and
doing something like that.
And the thing dies because, oh,
I forgot that I forgot to
shut off the other demo
that I did the week before,
and it consumed all the resources.
So, that will happen.
But if it does, I mean,
it just shuts off, right?
So it's not like you're on the hook
to pay the difference in
the money that's there.
- Awesome.
Well, Javier, thank you so much,
and thank you everyone
for tuning in today,
and we'll see you all next
time on "Bits & Pieces."
- Thanks, everybody.

hello my name is Ron Lou and I am a
program manager on the video studio team
in the previous video we talked about
how to install the tools for unity
development on your machine now it's
time to start building unity games today
we're going to demo two things first
we're going to create a new unity game
and then we're going to connect the game
with video studio let's get right added
now we're going to start creating our
first unity project let's launch the
unity editor here we have an option to
create a new project here you can pick
whether you want to create a 3d or 2d
game and whether you want to include
some asset packages one creation we can
pick one that says vehicles this is this
one comes with unity 5 so we have some
assets to play with when the project is
created
here we are inside the unity editor with
our first unity game credit here in the
middle we have our scene designer and
down here in the assets we can use some
standard assets that comes with the
package to start playing with the scene
so I'm going to go to aircraft and find
a prefab think of prefab like reusable
components so here I'm just going to
drag and drop this aircraft into my
scene
now we have an airplane to play with we
can click on each part and move things
around and I'm going to stop showing off
my art skills right here so here's this
is how we can create new projects what I
want to do is I will open a slightly
more finished project we have here for
the demo so I'm going to open a scene
right here from level one so this is
kind of fun zombie game what I want to
show you here is how then we can connect
this game to video studio to start
adding our game logic there are two ways
to do that first is you can go to the
assets menu down here this menu that
says open c-sharp project just click on
that this will automatically open video
studio for us now it's preparing the
video studios solution and in a second
your studio comes up and now we have our
unity game opened in video studio
here's a intro page that talks about how
to script for unity game and here we
actually have our C sharp scripts open
in Visual Studio let me close this real
quick because I want to introduce to you
the second way of opening the
the studio is if you already have a
script file in unity see I have all
these c-sharp files I can just double
click on any of the C shape files which
will then open video studio as well see
we're back in used to do with the stitch
are ready to open and everything is now
setup for us to start building our game
so this should all work automatically
for you if you have unity 5.2 installed
the instant installer not only puts all
the bits down our machine but also can
fix video studios such that it is the
default editor for unity well that
should happen automatically without you
configuring anything in case you want to
check if something is not working
correctly you can go to the Edit menu
preferences go to external tool look at
this external script editor option just
make sure Visual Studio 2015 is selected
as the default option and then
everything should just work with video
studio connected now we have our first
project created and connected in the
next video I'm going to walk you through
how to make edits to the unity scripts
in veal studio to start building our
game logics

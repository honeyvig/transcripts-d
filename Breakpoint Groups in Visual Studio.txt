hello everyone I'm Isadora I'm an
engineer in the visual studio debugger
team at Microsoft and for this demo I'm
going to show you what breakpoint groups
are and how they can be very useful when
you're context switching between
different bugs in the same project so
for this particular demo what I have
here on the right you can see it's a
very chaotic city which is authenticity
so this is a fort from transport icon
which is a very cute and sweet game that
I wanted to use for this demo this
project as you can see has a lot of
files so if I just want to keep track
and have a debugging workflow here I'm
quickly going insane but before we can
go on and say let's just try to
understand what this actually does just
we can have some context because context
is pretty important when you are
debugging something
so here you have a poses it's picking up
people and going back this is like one
of my favorites they have this pretty
training that's going here and pick you
up around and getting back to the city
and you also have this Mayo buses that
are just delivering mayo and coming back
to it so they are all different doing
different stuff and one thing that you
may have noticed is that through all
these different kind of things there are
different things that I want to make one
of the book so if you look here I
already have a set of breakpoints that I
picked just for this demo so here I have
stuff like order trace and check and you
can already have seen here that these
are actually a group of breakpoints that
point your other ones so it's much
quicker if I'm debugging a particular
context but let's say that I just want
to debug order comments so every time
someone has an order I'm going to stop
here and then I can just step through
and see what's doing oh for example here
it's asking this guy this phone call
here to go to this particular station
and I can see
oh this is and then I can just be super
confused about it or maybe I can just
pick this group idea and say that's his
name now and if I hit continue I'm just
going to stay here and let's say that I
don't want to debug orders anymore and
what I actually want to do is I want to
debug traits
so I can just click this right and it's
automatically enable all these other
breakpoints and then I can just hit
continue and then
you can see that I already checked if
the train stay in Depot or not but I say
I don't actually want to be here I want
to be somewhere else so I can just drag
this breakpoint around
maybe around here before it even has a
chance to return
and then you can see that I even reverse
my train and it's a different thing and
it's all part of this breakpoints here
and then I can just quickly keep
stepping and going through different
things and I have all the things that I
want evolving trains and I can even do
other stuff like let's say they only
want to debug trainings when order has
been emitted so what I can do here is
actually set that I only want this to be
hit when this breakpoint for order has
also been chosen
so you can see that they are all
disabled and then I actually have to
enable my parent breakpoint
and as soon as an order has been updated
here
right here you can see that all these
other breakpoints were just activated so
this can also be very useful to have a
function that SD cost several hundred
thousands of times and just want to
enable them in a particular context and
similarly I have this other I can do
like check orders so like every time
someone's updating the order I'm doing
something or just when someone is
unloading the cargo I can go ahead and
see whatever they are doing and yes just
so useful when you're sharing like
projects with like a huge team or like a
huge code base and you just want to keep
your debugging workflow saved somewhere
and actually persisted and actually
being able to jump through different
context switches around one of my
favorite things that even has support
for emojis so you can put Emojis
anywhere you want I highly recommend it
if you ever want to try something else
in your debugging workflow and that's
pretty much it so for follow-ups I
highly recommend checking out the
Twitter handle for vs debugger or the
blog post for breakpoint groups you can
find much more information about how to
create them how to use them or just how
to improve your debugging experience in
general

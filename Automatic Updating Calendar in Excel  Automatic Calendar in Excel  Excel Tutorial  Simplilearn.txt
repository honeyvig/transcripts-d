hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to create a calendar
using excel that is capable of
automatically updating itself sounds
interesting right but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies so if
you are a gig in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends in the it
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with the
automatically updating calendar using
excel
so for that we might want to use a few
simple functions in excel and let's get
started with it
so on the first sheet we will try to add
some data so we will be using data
validation in excel so we don't want all
that list of data to be appearing on our
calendar right so for that reason let's
create a new sheet and in the sheet
let's add our months
and
also let's consider a few years
we are not creating the automatically
updating calendar for just one year
let's create for a couple of years maybe
uh a 10 right so let's add in january
and excel has this feature where you can
just drag it and you'll get all the
months altogether at once
so it should be around december yeah
january february march april may june
july august september october november
and december similarly so we are in 2022
right now so let's add 20 23 and a
couple of more years maybe
so
just ctrl not ctrl shift lower arrow key
and now drag that to the december part i
think we'll get
a 12 years
so we have 20 33
now our list is ready now let's get back
to the original sheet
and i tried to take month and year as
well
copy the cells
and
paste it here
so there you go we have our months and
years now this will be our self months
and years
so here get into data option and here
get into the data validation option and
here select list option and
now it will ask you for the source now
where is the source
this is our source so we are hiding the
sheet from the users
now select ok and there you go now you
have a drop down menu same goes to here
get into the data validation option
select list and
go to the sheet number two where we have
hidden our okay select source now go
into the sheet where we have hidden our
ears select the range
and press ok
so there you have our month and year so
months you can select any one out of 12
so you have this crawl bar here and
similarly you can select any year which
you want so for now let's select 2022
and
the first month of 2022
now here
our calendar
so let's type in
monday
and the same applies here you can just
drag it until saturday
and sunday so you have all that here
right
now let's keep it a little wider so that
it's visible a little clearer
okay not too wide
that should be good
now
we will begin creating the calendar so
we don't know what day was the first of
uh
january 2022 of course it's saturday but
what if we didn't know or we don't have
any idea of the upcoming years what if
if someone asks you what's the first day
of jan 1st of 2033
so it would be a little difficult right
so let's use the help of few inbuilt
formulas from excel to find it out so
you can use the
inbuilt function that is date value
there you go we have our date value
and in date value we will consider
the month and
the year but before that let's provide
the date value as one for default which
is the first day
so this is a date value and
hyphen now let's press ampersand to add
the remaining part that is the month and
uh year so we use ampersand and
press double quotes
and inside double quotes press
hyphen
i guess we already have a hyphen so
instead of hyphen what we can do is
we can directly select the
month cell
there we go we have the muscle and after
that now we might need the hyphen
heisen and
press the ampersand again now our ear
value
so there you go we have our date value
function ready press enter and there you
can see some random numbers over here
this is because of a little formatting
error so you can change it you can get
into home and in home you can see the
number group and select that and inside
that you'll have custom option you can
also check with the date option but
let's go with the custom as we might
want to add a few more extra things to
our date
right so here you go
so you have
date month year
right so
we'll also add
a
day to our
calendar just ddt
they should help us with the week as
well that is first john 2022 saturday
right but
you can see that it doesn't go with
monday right here we have monday but the
date is
first jan and it is saturday and this
cell is supposed to be coming
here right
so there is some error regarding this so
this position of the week can be fixed
right this position of the week can be
fixed that's what we are going to focus
on in the next step so what we need is
the same formula but
with a little modification to it what
we're going to do is subtract this with
weekday of this particular value right
so now what you're going to do is minus
weekday formula
tab space
and
try to copy the same formula and place
it inside the weekday function
copy
paste
and another
yeah it should be somewhere here so
another attribute what weekday considers
is
the
date value
the day value that is a few people will
consider sunday as the first day of a
week few will consider monday as the
first day of the week so accordingly we
have here so if you're the one who's
considering sunday at the first day of a
week then the attribute should be one
but here we are considering monday as
the first day of our week so our
attribute will be three so tap space to
select it and close the function
there you go now you have the formula
ready to identify the correct position
of the weekday and the date value right
now
usually we might require or we know that
we have four weeks in a month but
sometimes you might end up having
five weeks or even six weeks according
to the arrangement of the position of
the day and the date of value so for
that let's create six rows to be on the
safer side so for that let's again cut
paste this formula here to the first day
that is monday
and as we know this is the perfect day
that is 27th of december 2021
right now our first day of january 2022
is somewhere over here so you are just
going to add one value to it right
so
equals to and the cell value plus one
enter
so there we have our next day so again
you can just
drag it to
have all these seven days
there you go we have the perfect dates
and similarly this one
so let's try to select all of these and
drag a little bit
so that we have a little more space to
fit in our data
there you go
now here
you're adding
seven more days to complete the week so
here we'll add
the
cell value plus seven days to get the
next adjacent date right so the value of
the date plus seven
seven days of a week to get the next
consecutive date followed by the second
january we'll have third january right
and now he can do the
same to this one and you'll have the
consecutive days now drag this to all
the
four
rows so that we have six rows there you
go a calendar is perfectly fine now now
we'll try to do few more modifications
to our
date value
so instead of having all the month year
and
week name we can just keep it as just
the date number right so just get into
numbers again numbers row and here
eliminate all these data and just keep d
for date
press ok so there you go we have our
perfect date arrangement over here
now
we will try to
minimize the calendar length or we can
just you know make a few modifications
to it monday tuesday wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday and sunday right
now we will
make some modifications
then try to fit it
there you go it looks good now
but we still have one issue to fix
that is we still have a few days from
our previous year that is 2021
and we have a few days from february as
well right so this looks like a problem
which is fixable
so we can make use of condition
formatting here to fix this
so get into
home and conditional formatting
and in conditional formatting
try to use a new rule and use the
formula to determine which cells to
format
now here
we are going to use the month function
month of the first cell that is
e
five in my case
not equal to
month of
any any cell in between the month so
we'll choose this one
and press ok
so what you want to do if if the cells
are not equal what you want to do get
into format
and
get into number and here choose custom
and
choose as
three semicolons or you can also do
an idea of you know kind of blurring the
numbers up so for now i'll choose to
eliminate the numbers or you know remove
the numbers or keep a blank space when
the condition fails right so we're going
to use three semicolons to fix that and
press ok
and press ok so there you go so the date
values which do not belong to the month
of the current month
will be eliminated
now you can also
try to
add a little more detail to your
calendar
you can you know you can
try to
highlight them
right
so
again you might want to get into
conditional formatting and new rule
and use a formula so here if if the
months are equal
month of
e5 or yeah the first cell e5
is equal to
month of
any location
that is month current
values
then
fill with some color which is relevant
to the calendar
so i'll choose blue and
press ok
and press ok
so those particular cells will be
highlighted
and
you can also make some minor
modifications to this as well
in a kind of fill it with
a blue
the text could be
white
bold
and you can also increase the text
font size
then
add borders
there you go and again if you wish to
uh also have the
month name and earning you can also do
that
margin center
and
equals
to the value
space and
the ampersands and
cell ear value press enter and there you
go
and even you can try to modify this as
well
you can choose to have darker variant of
blue and
increase the font
you can also choose to highlight the
cell color
you can also add borders to your
list
so there you go your automatically
updating calendar is ready
now let's select
the
january and
as our first query was to
find the first day of
2033
right so here we have 2033 and the first
day of 2033 january is saturday
and if you want another month you can
also choose that
let's say march and you have the changed
updated calendar over here so this is
how you create the automatically
updating calendar using excel so if you

hi everyone I am dr. Amrita patnik oral
and maxillofacial surgeon from the team
MDS conquer here is a 32 points video
from the subject operative industry now
this is prepared based on need as well
as aims point of view first point size
of microfilm composite in micrometer is
around 0.04 to 0.4 mm phone number to
fine type of diamond the abrasive having
particle size is around 60 to 70 4
micrometers point number three a Qing
time is required more in primary teeth
than in permanent teeth due to the
presence of a prismatic enamel in
primary teeth point number four for
etching most commonly used agent it's 37
percentage of phosphoric acid for number
five in a composite restoration if a
void is seen after polishing the area
should be roughened slightly and the
word should be refilled
point number six primer witches at the
same time is called as self-etching
primer for number seven layer removed
after etching the smear layer point
number eight in a classroom composite
restoration addition to gingival wall on
the root surface is most concerned about
first point difficulty in bonding
between the restoration and the tooth
second point is a micro leakage
point number nine gross finishing is
done with fine diamond bur point number
ten gingival bevel is given in class two
in their preparation at the rate of 45
degrees point number eleven Clary
opacity to composite as in part by
oxides of zircon fauna Bertrille
residual monomer in the denture base
affects the transverse strength of
denture base point number thirteen
neutral rake angle means straight face
and braided line coincide with each
other
point number fourteen carious lesion
that cannot be riemann realized is
infected dentin
point number fifteen the tension quotes
are appropriately placed under cuts for
the incisal retention of class three and
malcolm restorations and occlusal
portion of class five amalgam
restorations point number sixteen skirts
are used in cast metal restorations for
number seventeen permanent tooth which
shows cross form in occlusal cavity
preparation as mandibular second malas
for number 18 micro operation is used
for enamel stain for number 19
cumulative fluoride release is least in
comp amah for number twenty smooth
finish is achieved by thirty fluted bur
for number 21 minimal rise in pulp and
temperature is seen with high-speed
editor with coolant for number
twenty-two type used for complex
posterior class through cavity is
admixed high copper point number
twenty-three ran out of a burr is
accuracy of a book
[Music]
coin number 24 retention lock is a
prepared group whose length is in a
vertical plane for number 25 slot is a
retention groove in Denton whose length
is in a horizontal plane for number 26
skirts are prepared for providing
additional attention in casco
restorations point number 27 grooves are
placed on axial facial and actual
lingual line angles for number 28
sandwich technique is a technique where
composite will not want adequately to
dentin
therefore during polymerization it may
lead to formation of a gap at the cavity
margin situated in Denton this bond can
be improved by placing GIC lining
between the composite and the dentin
this is called sandwich technique point
number 29 laser helps in treating the
internal sensitivity by the mechanism of
the sensitization of the nerve fibers
and ceiling of dentinal tubules point
number 30 in silver modified a r/t
technique silver is added in the form of
silver diamond fluoride point number 31
high viscosity GIC is used in a arti
technique point number 32 experimental
caries and man was given by Warner fair
harold lowe else tell it thank you

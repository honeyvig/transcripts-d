hello everybody and welcome you all
so this is your host amarjeet and i'll
be taking you once again to the similar
tour of angular
and you know it very well previously we
have developed a lot of projects in
angular and this time also we will like
to make sure that we offer you some very
consistent project this time where it
will help you to connect all the dots of
whatever you have learned in an angular
so this particular session will be more
specific towards the project so stay
tuned with me because this time we'll be
offering you a lot of beautiful gui
which can combine together
to understand how angular can be best
suitable for the front-end application
and to make it happen you understand
like in this particular project we'll be
having a basic angular setup ready so
you know it very well to develop an
angular application we have used a
similar technique called
uh downloading the angular cli version
and we have used ngnu and the name of
the project is project and this
particular project does nothing has only
one single component name called app as
you can see it right now here
under the src you have a got app folder
app component dot html and here you see
appcomponen.ts
so that is one of the very very basic
component angular can hold in
so
this edge table contains a very simple
message called welcome and component.ts
contains nothing special it is just
holding one title and
app.module.ts if you see it contains
nothing special whatever it comes as a
predefined preloaded it contains only
those particular type of modules
and in my
app.module.ts sorry
yeah if you talk about call package.json
inside my package.json we have some
additional dependency added
which i will tell you like what
dependencies a part of angular which
comes as a preloaded are by default
available now you can see here
animation compiler core forms localized
these are all by default are there a
part of that we have also taken this
bootstrap as an additional dependency so
we talk about called ng bootstrap
okay which is the additional dependency
we have taken bootstrap jquery copper.js
rxjs which anyways comes by default and
here
these dependencies will be playing
additional role during your development
time
okay rest everything gonna be remain
same as it is but yes these additional
dependencies like in jquery poker and
your save tslip
and you talk about like in bootstrap
okay jquery these libraries are
additional to those the one which comes
as a by default
okay so once you have those additional
dependencies added into your project do
not forget that in your angular.json
you need to have
additional declarations to be get added
okay as you can see now under the
scripts part
okay under the styles part you see the
under the styles we have kept our
bootstrap.min.css
and under the scripts we have kept all
those necessary
dependencies with regards to our js
called demo
chart pie chart by demo you talk about
bootstrap you talk about jquery so these
are the additional dependencies we have
kept under the scripts part which is
here under your wrangler.json
okay and under the styles we have about
bootstrap through which we can directly
include these bootstrap related stuff
directly into my project
so that would be
the first thing which will start with
okay so
if i want to start my application i will
certainly say npm space start let me say
npm space
start
if it is launching my application
okay please use sudo
now it is launching
and under the port number 4200 my
application will be
starting up now it is saying port maybe
this application is ready somewhere
so
let me check if it is available
okay so application is already running
so inside my 4200 if i try to run i can
see
this by default message welcome appears
so that's the only thing with regards to
your project so nothing fancy it is just
a basic stuff your application have some
basic set of dependencies added and
along with this
uh you have some
new dependencies and you just you say
npm space start and under the localhost
4200 your project will get ready
okay so in my previous example you
remember like we have created and
done with our basic setup and now it's
time for us to go back and create some
new component into my project
now what are the first component i'm
looking forward for that is called
navbar for creating a navigation so
inside this first of all i want to open
a new one
okay so i want to say ng space g space c
space
nav bar
so let the new component get ready okay
so we have got never component ready
with me
so this is what my navbar is and inside
this navbar i want to add some
additional dependencies inside my html
okay so here
i may have lot of tags associated with
me
but here i want to start with my body
tag
okay so this is what i want to start
with my body tag
okay and here onwards we want to start
all my development so within my body tag
i will be writing a lot of other tags
too but first of all let me try to have
some additional dependencies to get
added here
so i want to add the div
and here
i would like to have some additional
dependencies to be get added as you can
see right now it is for jquery it is for
your bootstrap it is a scripts
okay this is for
charts this is for chart areas data
tables so these dependencies are very
much required in order to start your
basic development
okay and i want to continue
developing this example by adding some
new logic one by one
okay now what logic i want to add it now
so i will be using bootstrap as a basic
code
okay so first of all i want to use the
body
with some body
class equal to i want to give this name
called sb hyphen
nav
hyphen fixed
that is actually the bootstrap class
which we're associating with here
and here after that
we'll be starting with my div tag
so after body
here see this is the sb hyphen nav
hyphen fix which we have used now i'll
be using some
nav tag now
and inside my nav tag i want to say
class
equal to
sb
hyphen
top nav
space
nav navbar
space
nava hyphen
expand
okay space nav bar
hyphen we want to use the dark theme so
i'll be using
naval hyphen dark and space bg
hyphen
dark
so this is the first thing we are using
it now now inside my nav
okay we want to use few more important
details like i am saying like anchor
okay so with this anchor i want to say
a
before hdf we want to say class
equal to navbar
never hyphen brand
okay space nav bar
or else we can say hrx
we can use this
just add this single quotation and just
say href hr is equal to
index dot
html to go back
and after this will be also using
this img tag also so we just use this
img
src will be using some logo
okay which will be there under the
assets
okay under the assets i'll be having
logo dot
png
okay and we would like to also
uh say some controlling this
some width and height so we just use
width equal to what 80 percent
okay and we want to use
height
equal to 120 percent
so where's 80 percent height 120 percent
alt is maybe something optional you want
to give it i just want to leave it now
we do not want to give art as an
alternative
and if you also want to give style
so i say style
equal to now i say padding
hyphen top
colon
here i say
10
pixels
okay that's it so that's where exactly
the main logic is let me try to bring
this back
okay and here the anchor tag is closed
after this i'll be using my
button tag now
with this button we want to add some
class
class equal to btn
space btn
hyphen
link followed by btn
hyphen sm because i want to have a small
size button and i want to say order
iphone one
space
order iphone
lg
hyphen 0
okay
followed by id
equal to
sidebar toggle
what i'm saying sidebar toggle and after
that some more new properties like an h
ref i do not want to go anywhere so i'm
just saying
hrf equal to what
hash
in the single quotes
like this
okay and that's it
so within this button
i would like to offer
some i class so here i say i class
i
class
equal to
[Music]
okay fas fa hyphen bars
okay this is a special class available
and
that's it
which is there
now here the i class is getting close
and here the button is getting close now
okay so this is the first part of my
code now
okay now we talk about call navigation
on nav bar search so here i'm starting
with my
never
search
okay so inside my navbar search we would
like to offer some more new number of
fields so called form
okay so i start with my form
now with this form
i
may not say action for a time being so
i'm just removing this action from this
instead we are saying form class
equal to
d
d hyphen
none
space md
hyphen
inline
okay hyphen block
hyphen
block
okay so md hyphen inline hyphen block
after that you have to suggest form
hyphen
and here you see inline because i want
to go ahead with the inline form
and also ml
hyphen auto
space mr hyphen 0
space mr iphone md
hyphen
3
my iphone
2
space my iphone md
hyphen 0
so this is what all about our form but
within this form is not a closed it is
just a first portion of the form plus
along with this will be also offering
the dip class so we just use
them here i say
class equal to
input hyphen
group
input hyphen group
and
now inside this input item group i want
to use input class
input type equal to text
and here i say class
input
class equal to
form
hyphen
control
for hyphen control we would like to add
few more classes here first it is form
control type equal to what type it is a
type text and now we say
placeholder equal to
search
for
okay this is the property for me where i
want to use it
and
a part of that
search for we're giving it so since it
is giving so we do not need to give
double quotes
search for us single quotes is okay now
and now
area
hyphen
level equal to
search
one second let me try to make it
okay search here and uh followed by a
few more properties
so the first property i'm trying to use
it a part of this area search we say
area
hyphen
okay
described by and here we give the value
called basic iphone
hyphen
add-on to
okay so this is how we are trying to add
it now
after this what next
after this we would like to use another
div tag now
div
and here we say
class
equal to
inside this class we may offer a few
more details
uh okay like i can see input group
input iphone
hyphen group
iphone
append okay that is a div class and
inside this dip class
i would like to use also another button
here we say
class equal to
btn space btn hyphen
primary okay type equal to what it is a
button
so
that's it
and after that within this button i
would like to use
i
class
equal to
fs space fa hyphen
search
that's it so this is how we are making
it
first and now we'll be going ahead with
the next level okay so let's get started
with the next point now so we have
finished our div and dip form now let me
try to organize it properly
okay
now the div div and this part is getting
close and now we would like to talk
about our navbar part
okay so here
i'm starting with the nav point so here
accelerometry
and here i give the name called bar
just to tell you like this would be the
navbar related
stuff
here i'll start with my url tag now so
inside my ul i say you will space
class equal to
number
okay so we have a call navbar hyphen
nav
okay space ml
hyphen
auto
space ml hyphen
md
iphone 0
so that is for my ul so within this url
i'll be having
some li class also so we have got li
within this li i am saying
class
equal to
now what are the details i want i say
nav hyphen
item
okay nav hyphen i item space
drop down
okay so now hyphen item space what a
drop down now
now within this
li tag okay i want to use lot of other
tags too
so first tag i'm using this for anchor
tag
okay
so
in this anchor tag we want to say a
and followed by
class equal to
well i'm saying nav hyphen
link
followed by drop down
hyphen toggle
okay after this space
id
equal to
user
drop down
okay id equal to what user drop down
href
equal to we just make it as just a hash
because i'm not taking anywhere
after this hash we say roll
equal to
button so roll will be a button type
and the job doesn't get over here we
also have some option called
data hyphen
toggle
okay data hyphen toggle equal to drop
down
equal to drop down
space we also want to use some area
has popup
okay you can see there's a property
called idiot has pop-up so i just said
true
use exactly it does have
and we also want to say area hyphen
expanded you see now area hyphen
expanded we're also saying
false
apart of that
we also want to use some image within
this
so
image
so
in this image we want to say src src
will be entered
okay
assets under the assets it will be under
id
dot
png this is already sorry jvg
there's already one value available
inside this id png alt we don't want it
as of now
if you want you can add it otherwise i'm
just leaving it blank i'm just using
this option called style equal to
now
border hyphen
border
hyphen radius
okay this hyphen border it is how much
you want to give i'm saying fifty
percent
that is a css style okay and followed by
width
how much weight you're giving it i'm
saying 50 pixels
50
pixels
okay
that's the whole idea for this
now the anchor tag is getting closed
okay so here the anchor tag is closed
after the ignite tag is closed we would
like to give another tip class now for
the drop down
so we say
this div class will have some of the set
of properties which is available i say
div
class equal to
drop down
okay hyphen menu
and
followed by
iphone
menu
hyphen
right
okay
and
followed by we want to use area
area
hyphen you can see this option called
label by
okay equal to give the option name
called user
drop down i'm just giving the value user
drop down
value has been given now within this div
tag itself we'll be adding some new more
values
what those values will be i'm saying
anchor tag
class equal to
now that is an anchor tag
class
equal to drop down
drop down hyphen item
okay space
href
equal to hash
href equal to what hash
we are giving the value called what
settings
okay now i just copy this line
okay and uh
let's have only two for a time being so
drop down hyphen item hdf settings and
we give it a give
activity
lock
that's the value
for activity log
okay anchor tag is getting close now
here after that we use another tab tag
here it's called nested tip tag
okay so in this div tag we want to use
class
equal to drop down hyphen item
drop down hyphen
item and
i would say better drop an iphone
divider
drop down hyphen
divide it as a value and
in the same div tag
this div tag is getting closed here and
we're using one more okay
and class
equal to drop down hyphen
item
dropdown item item hrf equal to
give the value the one which you want to
give it i am saying hash
okay
it's difficult to what hash
let me close this
yeah hdf equal to hash and
we just use router link
equal to as you know it very well
in typical navigation we always use the
router link rather than normal href and
here we're giving the name call what
login
okay and here we can use
router link active equal to
active
okay
and here we get the name called log out
log
[Music]
out
okay so that's the value which we're
giving it now anchor tag is closed and
here the div tag is closed li ul and nav
so let me organize it
this one
this one
this one
and lab tag
let me format this
okay so that's what my file is
okay so let's continue to this so we
have created the value till now and we
want to start with this div diagonal
now with this div tag
we would like to have few more classes
added now
we say div id equal to
you can just give the name call layout
site info
layout
sidenav
so this is the first value we are taking
it now
with this layout side now
a part of this would like to use another
div tag now
and inside this div we would like to
offer the id
equal to
layout
site nav
whatever name we have used it
underscore now
that is a
second div type we have it now
now within this we want to use the nav
okay with this snap we want to say class
equal to
sb hyphen sidenav
sidenav
hyphen
menu
that value we are passing it to this
okay that is for
sb hyphen sidenav view
or along with this rather than menu i
can have another option with me to make
it even more better sb hyphen sidenav
space
accordion

okay
so
according we're going to give you the
kind of flipping type of moment one
after another sp hyphen
site nav
sb iphone sidenav hyphen
dock
and space id equal to
side neverword

we would like to bring another div class
now by saying live
and inside this div we will say class
equal to
uh i would say sp
hyphen side
nav hyphen

and that's it body will be closed post
that
okay so there are a lot of space let me
try to remove
that's it so now let me format it
let's see what this is always
confusion so guys our navbar component
is ready and after that we go back and
try to add few more things into my code
now we will create few more components
into my code so first component a part
of this
what we have seen i'm going to create
one more component name called toggle so
ng space g space c
space
toggle
okay a part of that we want to create
few more components here there is one
route
so ng space g space c space
routes
okay
so this component is ready along with
this
as we know it very well
like there are certain components which
we have created we also would like to
create few more components into my
application
okay by saying
ng
space g space c
space uh
[Music]
let's see
so under the routes we have got what
charts is another component which we
have seen now
okay now in a similar way i would like
to create one more component under the
routes and that is for login
component is ready along with this login
we would like to create a register
and
along with this we would like to also go
back and create one more component here
that is called
password
so charts login register password
so four components are ready now and
they're all inside what they're all
inside under the roots
okay so these all components are now
ready with me and we'll be basically
making all those components as
associated inside my routes part
clear now so which component used what
that we have to basically consider it
now so since they're all of the
components now
so under my
app.routing.model.tx we have to
basically provide a routings here now so
here we know conspire routes equal to
blank so let me try to say
path
okay path colon
if nothing has been given so the by
default component will be what
component
will be
navbar
component
so this network components automatically
comes up here
after that
if
path is of what
is static
component
is what
toggle component okay and here we are
saying
path match
colon
full
okay
along with this we're giving one more
path
colon login
so here
component
colon
login component
i'm going to put comma
component c small
okay now like this next we talk about
call path
colon
register
okay and here
component colon
register component
now let's talk about what path colon
what
change
password
so here we say
component
comma
component colon
which command we are trying to say
password component
also
next
we want to say path
colon
charts
then
so these are the components are now
available to me so these components are
now all set and later on we'll be
combining all the files together
in my system one by one
okay everybody so our all components are
now all ready so you see like we have
got navbar
which contains all the necessary
tags whichever is required for my
application
here we have a basically the login and
this login.component.html
actually contains all the relative part
which is
related to your login like you can talk
about call
email you talk about your password you
have a call remember me and forgot
password these type of details are
available inside your
logincomponent.html now so this is
basically the code okay which contains
your login related stuffs now
so it contains only few properties like
you talk about like email address
it contains what a password and only the
buttons through which user can
login through
followed by when i see my
password so this
password
file that is called
password.component.html
it contains the details
regarding to your password so that the
user can
give the password details or in case the
user has
or want to change the password so we can
give the details like okay you can enter
your email id
address where i can send the password to
you so here
we have this email address we haven't
implemented
your
i would say any kind of
sending the email to your
uh registered email id that logic hasn't
been implemented but it's just for the
demo like how exactly you can bring this
password
forgot condition inside your system now
so this is what the password and here we
have a link for the login and here we
have a registration
followed by if you think about call
register register contains that
register.component.html and here if you
see there are a few details which are
expecting from the user like in first
name last name email password confirm
password so these are the quick fields
which i'm expecting from the user to
enter
and here it's a button for
you know
confirming a password and this is what
exactly the links which are available
for the login
okay and for the login.html file so this
is a simple registration form which is
available to me
and that is last which is available for
me for that for me that is called
toggling part
in toggle part we are just offering
the details with regards to your how in
case if you want to toggle you can
change the settings okay based on
between the settings and activity
okay so these are the links which are
available through which you can change
all different type of toggling part
whether you would like to enable or not
enable
this is something which is related to
your page in case if you click on that
link so 401 page 404 page 500 page which
will be available to us
now let's try to run the code and check
how the final application really looks
like in
okay so now i'm trying to run my
application
by
saying
npm space start
once again
okay
okay
and now i'm trying to say
in game space start
let the project start now
and we'll see how it really looks like
it
so it is compiling all the files
okay and finally let's try to execute
localhost 4200
let me see what is an issue right now
okay let me check meanwhile try to run
it run it again
okay now i finally uh i'm into my
current project right now so
it was the wrong location where the
project was available so
i just like to say npm space start and
let the project run
so project is picking up till the time i
say localhost 400.
and beautiful guys this is how exactly
projects really looks like it
isn't isn't amazing right now
see how beautiful your project really
looks like it
this is what exactly the dashboard you
have it and this is the nav bar which is
available to you
getting it now see how better and
beautiful it looks and organize so this
is like in real time dashboard which is
available you can see the birthdays you
have it
you talk about
you know company announcement
quick links these are all basically
available these are the charts which you
can see can give some dummy values and
these are the charts will be really
available to you
so this is how the employee records
which we had it which we are displaying
it right now and this is how exactly the
chat looks like it
so weekly analysis and monthly analysis
this is the dashboard
and here the links are there but they're
all dummy links we haven't made it but
you can certainly make it further
okay you can search for
anything but it is not working right now
because it is just for the display
because nothing more than that it is a
home which you can see written like in
profile
this is like the profile which we have
created
by default the name is called kate adams
uh and this is designation like an
account it
and uh
like you can talk about like home under
the home you have a profile we have
called settings
so nothing is the research in the
settings so it is just a static record
attendance
it will be bringing you back to the same
page we have a call confirmation travel
expenses these are basically the dummy
links which are available we haven't
made it
which you can
see new development
okay part of that you see like profile
we have it settings
account activity if you see we have
called login and register this three
page if you remember we have created it
under this system
so you can see we have a got login we
have a call register we have a call
password so these are you are able to
see this now when you say change
password you see like
how they have given to you they're not
actually working but they're just like
in dummy option and you can see it will
be taking you directly to the sign up
option
okay
now here in your
settings once again you can look forward
for the login
it works like in
a typical model how it comes
apart of that we also have this
call register
so these are the fields of registration
form
and
you see about activity activity we have
because these pages are available there
are basically dummy pages which we have
created download confirmation so really
it this project really gives you the
kind of sense of in real time how
your
application angular application can
really
make your
ui more attractive which are more
competitive in market so i hope you guys
love this project so we have developed
most of the codes by our own
except few
which we have taken it from
online that is nothing but call uh
especially those images as well as
uh what to say some javascript related
libraries if you see which we are using
it right now here you think about think
about this uh
your
navbar.com.html if you see like these
are the libraries we have taken it from
internet
because certainly we don't type it
because it is taking long time to type
certainly we have taken from internet
and some images also we have taken it
from the internet
which are there under the assets folder
too
so if you see under the assets we have a
lot of images like an area chart bar
chart chart so this we have downloaded
from the internet
so hope you guys love this project thank
you very much and happy learning

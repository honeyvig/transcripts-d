welcome back my name is Dante Gagne and
I'm here to continue the connect learn
series on universal Windows platform
application if you've been following
along at this point you've got Visual
Studio installed on your machine and
you've got your first project created in
this video we're going to start creating
our actual application I'm going to be
working with the design surface in blend
to go ahead and create our first
controls I'm going to show you how we
can modify those controls by editing the
template and we're even going to go so
far as to use the adaptive triggers to
modify how your UI is going to look
whether you're working on a device or on
a phone for starters let's go ahead and
jump into blend now many of the things I
show you here you could do either in
blend or in Visual Studio but I'm a
blend guide that's where most of my
experience comes from and you know I'm a
little bit more comfortable here but you
can choose whichever application you
like now I'm looking at blend and the
first thing you're going to notice is
that my design surface looks somewhat
like a phone well I can change that just
by modifying the value up here at the
top left so I can choose you know I want
to actually think I'm working with say a
decent sized desktop I'll go ahead and
select a different design surface and
down here at the bottom change that to
fit all so just by changing that drop
down I can change my design surface to
whatever size that I want to use
conceptually now later on when we get to
adapt the triggers I'll show you how to
actually deal with different device
sizes this is just working with my
artboard now control creation is pretty
simple for this demo I'm just going to
create a simple text block that is going
to say you know hello world that's what
everybody likes to start with in blend
you've got your controls just to the
left of the artboard in Visual Studio
they're located in the toolbox and I'll
show you where that is in a moment but
all I'm going to do is select my text
block and drop one out on the design
surface the default font is looks a
little bit small here but realistically
I'm kind of zoomed out because I have
such a large design surface but I'm
going to start by changing my font size
to be a little bit bigger so we can see
it
and type HelloWorld click anywhere
outside the text block to finish your
edit so now I've got my traditional
hello world application I'm going to go
ahead and deploy this to my local
machine all I need to do to do that is
click the button up here congratulations
we've created our first hello world
application now let's take a look at
what I can do to make my application a
little bit more you know customized so
I'm going to close this and I'm going to
create an OK button for myself so let's
create a button so I'm going to drag one
out
I'm going to change the font size and
I'm looking in the properties I don't
remember exactly where that was so I'm
just going to do a search for it there
we go change the font and buttons
instead of using a text command use a
content command the difference is a
button can actually have graphics it can
have a whole wide range of controls
inside it where a text box can only use
text so I'm going to set the content of
my button to just say okay this is what
I would call kind of your default button
now what happens if I want to change
that let me show you how easy this is
when you're working with the universal
Windows application now I'm going to go
ahead and fit selection on my design
surface so I can see what I'm doing a
little bit more easily I'm going to
right click the button and just scroll
down until I find edit template and edit
a copy I could choose create empty if I
wanted to that would create a completely
blank button for me to work with but in
this case I would like to have something
to start with now I'm going to click OK
and now the object and timeline on the
left is showing me my template this is a
template that can be used for any button
anywhere in any application that I have
I've edited my template and what I'm
doing now is I can modify the look I'm
going to select my route grid and I'm
going to drop a rectangle down in that
grid I'm going to drag it behind the
content presenter the content presenter
is the control that whatever I said is
the content for the button it shows that
inside my template and then on my
rectangle I'm just going to change the
rounding I'll just drag this a Dorner
here and round it out a little bit and
for my route grid you know all of these
are things that you can choose to do
whatever you want to do to make it look
your way I'm going to take the
background and reset it so now my button
looks like this fairly simple changes
but all I've done here is I've modified
the way my OK button looks now I'm going
to scope back to my main document
I'm going to do a fit all and what makes
this kind of cool is when I drag out
another button I can right-click it
choose edit template apply resource and
pick the button style that I just
created
now it'll go ahead and customize that
control in exactly the same way this
allows me to give all of my controls a
consistent look now the last thing I
want to do here is I want to show you
how you use adaptive triggers to modify
the layout of my application whether I'm
working on a desktop or on a phone so
the first thing I need to do is I'm
going to go to the state's pane I'm
going to create a state group
it doesn't really matter what I name the
group I'm just going to be working here
and adding a couple adaptive triggers so
the first one is going to be wide the
second one is going to be narrow for
each one of these I'm going to edit an
adaptive trigger I'm going to add one
and I'm going to change the minimum
window width to 1024 for the second one
I'm going to set its minimum width to
320 so what I've done here is I've told
the system take a look at the width of
my application if it's more than 1024 I
want all of my controls to be in the
places they are when the wide adaptive
trigger is selected if it's not greater
than 1024 it will drop down to the next
adaptive trigger in this case narrow and
move everything to that location let me
show you what I mean I'm going to go
ahead and drag both of these buttons
over to the left and just for fun I'm
going to rotate my hello world label if
I hold down shift it'll do it by even
increments so what I've done now is I've
informed the system that if I'm working
with a wide application something the
full width of my screen or actually
1,024 pixels or wider this is where I
want all the controls as soon as I go to
a narrow form-factor this is where I
want my controls and let me show you how
that behaves I'm going to press play up
here deploy this to my local machine
again and by default the size I'm going
to get is going to be nice and large so
everything will give me the wide layout
the default width of this control is
actually less than 1024 so it's using
that narrow adaptive trigger but as I
make it wider you'll notice as soon as I
cross that 1024 threshold everything
moves to the wide position now this is a
very simple example here and you'll see
that as you're working with a phone or
something like that the controls will
move around exactly where you want them
to move but this gives you an idea of
how you can use your adaptive triggers
to change your overall you
whether you're working on a phone
whether you're working on a laptop or
whatever device you happen to be working
with and that's all there is to it
now you see how to use design surface to
start creating your UI and even
modifying some of those templates now
the state's panel the place where I was
working with those adaptive triggers
that's only available inside a blend if
you want to work with adaptive triggers
in visual studio you can still do that
but you need to work at the code level
which means you're authoring the zaman
by hand the intellisense will help you
with all of that out but you know it's
just one of the differences between
blend and Visual Studio in the next
video we're going to be diving a little
bit further into debugging so we can
deploy our application and we can take a
look at getting the business logic
behind the scenes right I'll see you
then

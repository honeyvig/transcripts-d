hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel in this session we will
be learning about charts and graphs in
Excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple Technologies so if you're a
tech gig in a continuous hunt for latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further Ado
let's get started with our onepoint
agenda that is graphs and charts in
Excel now let's quickly get onto the
Practical mode where we will have some
data sets over which we will be trying
to apply the charts now there are
various types of charts in table and
those are the pie chart the column chart
the bar chart column versus line pavier
chart and Spar line charts so we will
discuss one after the other first let us
discuss about the pie chart so as you
can see we have a small data set on my
screen which I have personally created
and uh this deals with the companies and
this deals with the shares of the
automobile industry so now for this
let's create a pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we're going to use the insert
option and when you select the insert
option you will have a ribbon here and
inside inside the ribbon you can see
groups tables illustrations addin and
here you go these are the charts so now
we needed a pie chart so select on that
icon and you have various types of pie
charts you have two dimensional pie
charts three dimensional pie charts
donut type of charts Etc right so I
would like to go with the
three-dimensional pie chart as it looks
a little more appealing and easy to
understand and now there you go this is
the title of the chart and these are the
legend of the chart and this is the
chart area and these are the values now
we can uh you know kind of add the data
labels as well so you can just have to
press the plus icon over here and you'll
have the options you can add the data
labels which will give you a lot more
interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be uh a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients right
yeah and there is another option where
you can directly explode this like you
can pick it out you can see this right
Point explosion where you can split it
out and you can show that especially
like you can highlight it and show it so
that's the you know a great way of
presenting your data so that's how you
can work with pie charts in Excel now
let's quickly move to the next one that
is the column chart and in the column
chart we have the data related to some
company and uh the profits of that
company based on a year so you can see
that the year has started from 2008 and
it has gone until 2021 and these are the
profits of that company year after year
so since we are dealing with column
chart I'll tell you the simplest way to
create a column chart there is a
shortcut key for that which is alt F1
and there you go you have the chart
right on your screen
now you can uh expand the chart just by
dragging it like that and you can see
that there is some problem with this
chart that is we have numbers here
instead of ear right you can see that
the First Column is the years which is
2008 to 2021 but here you can see we
have 1 2 3 4 which is not proper right
so to change the axis that is you can
see the axis which is 1 2 3 4 from 1 2 3
before to the years 2008 2009 2010 11
Etc you just have to make one change
here and also you can see I have pressed
the plus icon over here which will open
the option where you can include the
access titles if you have and data
labels everything right so for now I
think I'll keep it as it is so you can
include the data table as well as it is
here and you can include that in the
chart there are various options that
Excel provides you so now let's uh focus
on changing the axis from 1 2 3 4 to the
ears for that you need to select the
chart design and inside the chart design
you have an option called select data
press that and here you have various set
of options you can see profits you can
see ears now we'll select ears and we
will remove that and now you can see the
edit option here right select that and
now it will ask you which column to be
selected for the access range for that
let's select this and now let's select
the ears
here and press okay and there you go
again press okay so there you go you
have the ears over here instead of the
numbers which you had in the first place
so that's how you create the column
chart and we have the next type of chart
which is really simple now you know you
kind of change this chart directly into
bar chart there is no big deal in
that so uh for that you just need to
select the change chart type option over
here you're just changing the chart type
and you can get the bar graph over here
column and bar graphs are completely
same to each other only that you can see
these uh bars in the horizontal way
rather than in the vertical way let's do
that let's not create a new thing for
that so uh yeah there you go when you
select the change chart type option you
have various set of chart type options
on the menu bar over here so what we
needed was the bar chart now let's
select that and there you go let's
select okay and you have the bar
chart right and if you want you can
include the data labels which look a
little bit more interesting you can also
include the data table as
well okay for now I think we have to
expand the chart to get the Clear
View yeah that's how you do
it right now let's move into the next
type of one yeah we dealt with the bar
chart so we'll directly enter into the
column versus line chart so we have
similar kind of data we just had year
and profits in the previous part now we
also have included the expenses right we
needed another column to showcase the
line chart compared to the columns right
so for that I've included a new column
that is expenses Al as well now just
let's select the
data and let's select the option alt F1
to create our
chat right now automatically uh Excel
has provided us the column chart we have
The Columns of expenses we have the
column of profits and we also have years
now let's change the data as we did
before select uh year and remove it and
then
edit select edit and select the ear that
is from here to
2021 select okay and we have the ears
over here now what we needed to do is
change the chart type right select the
change chart type option and since we
wanted to create a column versus line
chart it is a combination whenever you
want one or two types of charts included
in one single chart window then it is a
combo option so here we need to select
the combo option and inside that we have
various types of combination charts we
have clustered column we have clustered
line on secondary axis we have clustered
stat areas clustered column and the
other one is custom combination so let's
go with the first one that is clustered
line let's select that and there you go
we have the line graph with the column
so that's how we create the column
versus line
and if you want you can include the data
labels and you can include the data
table as well yeah okay I think uh we
need to expand the canvas a little more
to get a clear
view
yeah so you have Legends over here you
have the data labels and accesses
everything and chart title you can
always change the chart title so for now
let's uh rename it as
profits versus
expenses yeah that's that's how it
goes done okay I think I made a spelling
mistake
here yeah it's clear
now now the next type of chart we're
going to deal with is the P
chart so uh we have dealt with P chart
column chart bar chart and column versus
line now P chart is a little bit
different it's like you're going to
create some active chart which responds
to the variations you're making to your
data so to understand that better let's
create a practical chart over here now
select all the
data
okay yeah I have selected the data now
to create a pivot
chart let's
select the insert option from the
toolbar and inside the ribbon we have
charts group and inside that we have PIV
chart now let's select the P chart
option and there you go now it's asking
for range and we have selected the range
over there and uh we are not going to
create a new worksheet for the entire
chart we are going to create the uh
chart inside the existing worksheet
itself so for that let's select the uh
area where we want to select the uh
chart to be present now for that let's
select this and U yeah select
okay okay there is some
error let's cancel this and try
again let's select the
data and prev chart
again we have selected the
range
yeah that's how you select the range and
now select the position where you want
to create it existing worksheet we have
selected that and press okay yeah that's
that's the way we've got our previous
chart over here and you can see our
previous chart is completely blank right
now it will respond to the changes you
make to your P chat for now we have uh
serial numbers and U these are the names
of the guys who
have okay so these are the names of the
guys you who have some dealerships for
various car makes such as Ford Ferrari
Honda Kia Alpha Romeo BMW etc etc so uh
we're GNA change or we're going to see
um you know we're going to make some
charts of the persons who own the cars
or the car brands or dealerships in
various regions so we're going to work
on that now let's drag in the
name and uh let's drag
region and
cards and the units
yep so we have our uh chat over here
column chart which has the different
different names and the dealerships and
some of cars over there right so you can
see that we can also change some values
over here what if we wanted to know only
uh the details regarding Jennifer you
can do that you can unselect everything
and you can just select Jennifer and
press okay now you'll have the details
of only Jennifer of having the car brand
so we have the regions as well so
Jennifer owns dealerships in two
different regions that is South and West
and uh the sum of units and count of
cars as well so that's how the PV charts
are used in real
time and now let's select sales and drag
the sales as
well yeah it's been dragged and you have
the sales of uh
Jenifer the details of her sales and
let's move the chart a little bit and
you have the plus icon where you can
include the data labels for a better
information yeah so that's how you use
the P charts so we are on the last type
of charts which is the spark line chart
Now to create a spark line chart we need
to get into the insert option and inside
we have the ribbon and inside the ribbon
we have the group that is spark lines
now to generate a spark line chart we
need to select this particular column
and then select the type of spark line
you want to create for now let's create
the column type of spark line chart yep
we have to Club these cells together
first we forgot that because we're going
to insert the spark line chart right
above here now for that let's merge the
cells
[Music]
yeah so uh we wanted to create
the spark line chart of column type and
now it's asking for the location where
we want to create the spark line chart
so this is the location now let's select
okay and there you go we have the spark
line chart right over here now you can
see that we have a negative Point here
so if you want you can change that from
negative to positive and it will
automatically update that and if you
want to add the access to this
particular chart you can select the
options Park line and there go you have
certain options like High Point low
point and if you wanted to add some
margin you can also do
that add the data type access and there
you have the
access show access yeah you have the
access now and you can have the high
point point and low point for that as
well which is the you know the biggest
change and the smallest change in this
particular segment that is few Furniture
yeah Furniture had the highest sales in
January and uh home plance had the
lowest sale and you can also change the
color and uh let's type of change the
color again yeah we have a different
color over here which resembles a little
bit more better or you can also go with
this one and if you wanted to add the
same to all these tables you can do that
just by dragging it and you have it for
all the 6
months now if you wanted to add some new
data in this row or you wanted to add a
new complete row then you can do that as
well and change that and bring that
change implemented in these charts as
well now let us try to add a new row
here which includes the miscellanous we
have that data right over here let's
select that copy and and uh let's paste
it over here so there you go we have the
extra row here so yeah now we have added
the miscellaneous row and right now we
have the spark line chart for only four
columns or four rows that is Furniture
technology home appliances and office
needs and miscellaneous is missing now
to add that as well let's select spark
line and inside sparkline just select
edit Group location and data and now
let's select the entire your
data and now select
okay there's something wrong
again spot line edit
data select
range this should be helping yeah there
you go we have all the fire rows now
including Furniture technology home
appliances office needs and
miscellaneous now for this particular
example we going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little bit
so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the second column is the
start dates of the employees that when
have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
worked in that particular organization
so to create a Gant chart is really
simple you just have to select the date
data and then go to the insert option
and in there you can see the charts icon
and select all charts and in that select
the bar chart and here you can see the
Stacked bar chart select that and press
okay and there you go you have the
Stacked bar chart right on your screen
let's expand this a little more so that
we have the clear visualization of the
dates as well now you can if you want
you can change the title as org data or
employe
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chart and series
values are let's select
this and select let's move move a
little yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
Gan chat on my screen right here select
okay and it's done and still now it's
not complete yet so to finish it you
need to select the blue colored bars
here and right click on them and select
format data series
go to the fill icon and select no
fill and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse order
and there you go you have your Gant
chart right on your
screen now with that we have come to an

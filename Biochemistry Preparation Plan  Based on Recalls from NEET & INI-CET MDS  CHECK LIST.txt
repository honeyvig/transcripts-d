hi venus
very very good morning one and all
hope you are all set for biochemistry
okay right so before going to
biochemistry you should know some
background history related to the
biochemistry okay so once you are very
strong with the background of
biochemistry then you can handle this
subject as simple as possible and as
easy as possible
so
if you just list out all the subjects i
feel like biochemistry is the strongest
subject
okay why it is tough for us it's tough
for us so what my school suggestion for
all of you is whenever you have a tough
candidate in front of you for example
among the list of teachers
okay so a particular department people
are so tough
so what you do you don't quit the
department you have to pass the
department right so what i do is
i give more respect
i am very serious about the particular
department i finish
my quarter or i finish the things on
time i'll try to score more in my
internals this is what i used to do when
i have a tough department and similarly
for example in a family in a group of
family ok your toughest may be your
mother or toughest sometimes maybe your
father or maybe toughest sometimes maybe
your brother or sister or very strict
so when you have such such a candidate
so what you do you show more respect
you'll be you you'll you'll keep an eye
on the particular person so that
you should be safe
in related to the particular person
similarly biochemistry has to be given
such importance among the list of the
subjects along with few other subjects
okay i'll disclose those other subjects
when they are coming in the schedule but
as of now biochemistry is one of the
tough individual where you have to show
utmost respect where you have to give
up most importance where you have to
frequently visit where you have to
frequently call them frequently message
them
message call visit is nothing but
frequently revise them okay so before
you start biochemistry all these 11 or
10 days make sure every day you get up
and wish that biochemistry should be
easy easy easy tell yourself hundred
times
this 10 to 11 days so that
biochemistry will reciprocate and
biochemistry will definitely be easy
subject
okay so first start loving biochemistry
so let's focus on biochemistry for the
upcoming 10 or 11 days of our schedule
okay jumping into
the reality of biochemistry what is
biochemistry why we have to read
biochemistry what is the scoring
criteria everything like different
mentors has a different opinion few
mentors okay so they simply say quit
biochemistry if you ask parents they
quit biochemistry completely but now if
you see the drift in the examinations
examinations now become balanced
examinations means they are picking
questions everywhere in a balanced way
examination so now they become
integrated
integrated means a content of
biochemistry will be linked to other
subject or a clinical part
okay so for example you have many
diseases which are associated with
enzyme deficiencies enzymes is basically
a topic of biochemistry
so this enzyme defect will be indirectly
linked to a clinical finding what we
learn in the medicine that is maybe
general medicine or maybe oral medicine
or maybe any other subject and they are
going to ask a question indirectly they
are going to ask a biochemist related
question there is something like if you
go to general medicine and see that
something called as acid-base reaction
questions are very frequently asked
which are again common topics for
general surgery also so that is directly
or indirectly acid based reactions are
linked to
the biochemistry
there are many such things so nowadays
the papers are drifting more to
integrated
integrated questions
or maybe more of a balanced questions
keeping all these in mind you cannot
quit any subject and biochemistry if you
love it
you will rock it okay and biochemistry
coming to the list of few subjects it's
a i'll consider this as a closed subject
for a dental student i'm not bothered
about the medical people medical people
has to read top to bottom about
biochemistry for a dental student
biochemistry is a closed subject means
the question will come from a particular
zone itself
they cannot give diversified
questions okay so most of the questions
will be in a closed zone you have a
closed material or you have a closed
list of topics or list of things to be
done if you do that you can score
maximum in biochemistry
but
a medical student is a different
scenario being a dentist it is a close
subject i can consider this as a close
subject almost like your dental anatomy
dental history these are close subjects
means the topics are limited and the
questions will be coming only from these
particular topics only from this
particular zone so such subjects are
called as closed subjects so among such
subjects biochemistry is a close subject
other important point what we have
learned about biochemistry biochemistry
is a strong subject
subject which requires respect
subject which requires repeated visits
nothing but revisions
so biochemistry what i can simply tell
you is biochemistry can be divided into
two things one is conceptual
biochemistry one is memory based
means for every concept there is
something a memory thing that you have
to remember only if you remember those
memory based things then you can make a
conceptual question right
how simple for example if they are
asking what are the irreversible
reactions or what are the reversible
reactions in a particular metabolism for
example glycolysis
what are the reversible real this is a
memory based thing
this is a memory based thing
okay so this memory based thing for
example next question they are asking
sequence of enzymes which are involved
in the cycle of glycolysis that is a
memory based link to a conceptual thing
so this this orientation of brain is
very required to score better in
biochemistry first
the pillar the pillar
the basement is a memory based thing
upon which the concepts are going to
strong so without memory based thing you
cannot do anything in biochemistry so
this keep in mind so that is the re that
is the reason why i'm telling you
repeated revisions respect
repeated calls are required for
biochemistry and we try to follow the
same and i want you guys to follow us so
that the journey is going to be simple
and easy with the biochemistry
so jumping into neet according to neat
blueprint biochemistry is going to carry
seven marks
it can be integrated to other subjects
so you can make seven to nine marks okay
few subjects like a ph of saliva can be
a biochemistry question also ph of uh
gastric acid juice can be a biochemistry
question so there are many such things
that's what i'm telling acid-base
reactions many things can be interlinked
to your biochemistry for example
vitamins vitamins is a common topic but
it's more specific to a biochemistry
question so i can conclude seven to nine
marks in and around directly or
indirectly okay from biochemistry and
similarly for ini cet also inicit it
varies it varies sometimes the questions
will be filed sometimes the questions
will be done sometimes the questions
will be 15 there are cases where we have
seen 10 plus 15 plus direct or indirect
indirectly we see 15 plus questions in a
particular question paper of
biochemistry of ironic
so it is a subject which should not be
ignored leave about the blueprints but
it should not be ignored and it should
be done in a most perfect and organized
way
so jumping into the next part of
biochemistry the checklist most of you
are worried about the checklist must do
okay so you can you can consider it as
must do or you can keep this as
checklist
and this checklist is very specific to
mds conquer students one are the
students who are following our youtube
channel okay so i cannot generally
because i always request you or everyone
to follow your mentor
okay
whatever it is your mentor you ought to
follow even
if you see cricket cricket or any sort
of game there may be countries which
play low game high game anything you
have to follow your coach so follow your
mentor whatever your mentor is telling
you try to follow it but this is very
specific for
the plan which is prepared for mds
conquer students in very specific
so what my suggestion is
for any topic before you start
my kind suggestion for you
is to
finish
the dental
pulse
synopsis
of the particular topic for example the
first topic may be carbohydrates first
you finish the carbohydrate synopsis in
the dental pulse
the next one
try to finish the
synopsis
of
smart notes
available on
website
or
pp books
synopsis
okay right so you have to finish so once
you get synopsis content
okay so then you get a diversified
knowledge related to this
okay so then next one is your smart
videos
you have to do it
you can do one like if you there are few
people who love to read synopsis first
and then jump into the smart videos okay
because this is a dry subject or you can
do smart videos first
and then jump into the synopsis this is
your wish
okay so if it is like an indoor subject
i'll definitely ask you to watch the
smart video first because endo you're
already familiar with the cases you're
already familiar with the conditions
you're already familiar with the stuff
which were done recently in your final
year or you are working as a clinician
you see the cases you see you know the
terminologies biochemistry there was a
long lap it was done in the
bds first year almost like four or five
years back so that is the reason why i'm
asking you to do the synopsis first then
jump into the smart videos so the video
journey will be very smooth and easy or
else you can start with the smart videos
jump into the synopsis part later so
this uc which is better what to be done
first
first
followed by these two can be done or
first followed by this can be done
okay so once you're done with the smart
videos
then jump into the mcq part
so mcqs i want you to stick on to dental
pulse
as a first source followed by solve mcqs
on the
website
solve mcqs on the website we will try to
provide more mcqs biochemistry will be
done uh 10 days in the first round and
probably six days in the second round so
i'll try to provide
n number of mcqs more exposure will be
provided from team mds conquer
so these mcqs initially you can do topic
specific
available on the website
then once you're done with the all
topics then you can jump into the
subject specific
so subject specific one exam will be
provided during round one of
biochemistry second exam will be
provided during round two of
biochemistry right
so apart from this okay so first you i
want you to stick on to dental pulse
mcqs
followed by the explanation part
after that i want you to attend the
evening activity on the group
learn some more stuff
then after evening activity i want to
attend the exam that is present on the
website that is your topic specific exam
present on the website
right so this is the pattern i want you
to follow for biochemistry for all the
topics
as of now website we have some 16 to 20
odd videos are available okay 16 to 20
odd videos that are available you have
seven to eight topic specific
examinations available you have seven
smart notes available so i want you to
prepare a checklist proper checklist
okay dental pulse synopsis how many
pages you have to do
pp books if if you have pp books bio
chemistry how many pages are there smart
notes
seven smart notices are there each
content how many pages
dental pulse how many how many topics
are there to be done how many mcqs are
they to be done
and coming to the website how many
topic specific exams are there to be
done so this is what the sequence
so first i want you to start with either
smart video
or with the pulse synopsis then jump
into the next part
the third part is mcqs of dental pulse
the fourth checklist is evening activity
the fifth checklist is mcqs on the
website
so these are mandatory things that you
have to do so as of now biochemistry in
round one you will have two pro life
classes
round two you will have these two
prolife classes plus one extra class
a revision class of prolife so as of now
we are sticking on to round one you will
have two pro live classes of
biochemistry okay and every day you will
have an activity evening okay your
activity will be from 6 to 6 30 or 6 40
40 minutes activity every day your pro
life class will be from
six o'clock in the evening to
7 30
okay 7 30 or 7 45 slight variation will
be there because of ramjhan season that
is requested by our student but
regularly we stick on to six
to 730 or 745 okay so this is what the
sequence of biochemistry that you have
to do coming to the topics of
biochemistry
so the first day we are going to cover
carbohydrate
structure followed by the metabolism
protein structure protein metabolism
lipid structure and metabolism so
structures are easy metabolism is a bit
difficult where you have to use lots of
memory
next comes is the vitamins
vitamins and minerals nowadays they are
giving case-based questions related to
the vitamins
minerals important but vitamins is damn
important so among the list of
biochemistry the five star topic is
going to be the vitamins
and your carbohydrates is going to be a
four star topic
your enzymes is going to be a four star
topic
and your uh protein metabolism lipid
metabolism is a three-star topic
right it's a three-star topic
so
so apart from
your general biochemistry which is going
to be a simple topic here we need to
learn about
dna rna metabolism of dna and rna this
is again a
three-star topic okay
so these are all important areas that
you have to focus on biochemistry so
let's work hard
so step one i hope you are very clear
with biochemistry and let's start
working on biochemistry so
once you are ongoing through the process
you will really love the magic of
biochemistry and most probably you will
fall in love with biochemistry if you
read biochemistry
in a proper way
all the best take care stay positive
uh
if you need any suggestions help or
anything uh we are always hoping to help
you out so my number is double nine
eight nine four two seven nine seven one

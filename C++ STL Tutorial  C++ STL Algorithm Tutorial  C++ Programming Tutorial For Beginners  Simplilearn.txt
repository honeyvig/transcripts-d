hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn and in today's
session we will learn about c plus stl
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
in this session we will learn about what
is stl then we will understand the
components of stl like containers
iterators algorithms and function
objects
so without further delay let's get
started
stl stands for standard template library
it is a set of template classes that
provide us data structures and
algorithms or containers
it allows the programmer to use
predefined functions which helps them to
write the code quickly and in an
efficient way
for example you are solving a problem
that needs sorting now instead of
writing the code to sort you can make
use of stl
now stl mainly consists of four
components that is containers iterators
algorithms and function objects
so first is containers
these are collection of objects that
store data of similar type in stl we
have different types of containers some
of them are array vector set map and
these containers are generic in nature
so further these containers are of three
types that is sequence container
associative container and container
adapters
sequence containers these are those
containers that can be accessed
sequentially for example vector dq list
are some of the containers that store
data in a linear form
next is associative container
these are those containers that
implement sorted data structures in this
elements are retrieved via keys and each
associative container maintain its keys
in sorted order
example set multi-set map and multi-map
after that container adapters these
containers are like sequential
containers but they are implemented by
modifying their interface to provide the
desired behavior for example stack queue
and priority queue are some examples of
container adapters
now coming to iterators in stl iterator
plays an important role as it links
algorithms and containers iterators are
those entities that helps in traversing
through containers
they are used to point at the memory
address of the steel containers
iterators also helps in traversal from
one element to the next element in the
range using operators like increment
operator
iterator contains two functions that is
begin function and and function the
begin function returns the iterator to
the first element and the and function
returns the iterator to the last element
now coming to algorithms
algorithms in stl can be defined as
procedure that are applied to the
container and provides some operations
on the content of the container
and because stl algorithms are built in
so that is why they save considerable
amount of time
in algorithms we just have to make a
function call and we don't have to write
the lines of code to implement it
now let's have a look at types of
algorithms
first is modifying algorithm
non-modifying algorithm sorting
algorithm searching algorithm
and numeric algorithm
modifying algorithms are those
algorithms that make changes to the
sequences
swap and reverse functions are some
examples of it
then non-modifying algorithm
non-modifying algorithm are basically
read-only function they do not modify
the data on which they work on
some examples are count equal and search
functions
then sorting algorithms
this algorithm is used to sort the
container elements its example is sort
function
next is searching algorithm
as the name suggests this algorithm
searches for the element binary search
algorithm is mostly used search
algorithm
last is numeric algorithm
this algorithm work on numeric values
or we can say it solves some numeric
problems examples are accumulate
function and partial sum functions
now coming to function objects
function objects are also known as
functors a function object is an object
of template class that implements call
operator
this call operator allows the object to
be used with same syntax as regular
function call
for example suppose you have declared an
object obj of a class in which operator
is defined
then you can use the object obj just
like a normal function
function objects also helps in
generating the data and it also helps in
testing purposes
now in order to do some examples let's
move to our code editor that is vs code
so here we will do an example of vector
container
so let's make a new file
and
let's name it stl.cpp
now we'll add the header files
now writing namespace standard
now
we will add before namespace standard we
have to add
the header file for vectors because we
are doing the example of vector so that
is why we have to add the header file of
vector
okay now
we'll write int main
now first of all we'll declare the
vector so we'll write vector
int
within the angle brackets
now we will write
the name of the vector that is v
okay now we have to push
some elements inside the vector for that
we have to use for loop
so we'll write for keyword
and i equals
let's say 1
i
less than
equals 10
i plus plus that is increment operator
okay now we have to push the elements
one by one so we'll write v dot
push
back
and inside the bracket
we will put i
so the elements
will keep on adding one by one at the
end of the vector
so now we will check the size of the
vector
so we'll write
we'll write the message size
and then the function v dot size
it will tell us the size of the vector
that is the number of elements inside it
as you can see they that we have put 10
elements inside the vector one by one so
it must be 10
so in order to check it we have used
this function v dot size
okay now
we'll use another function
that is v dot resize
it will resize the size of the vector
so whatever we put inside this bracket
like let's say i've put seven so its
size now would be seven
and we need to check this also
so
we'll again use the function
size so first of all we'll display the
message
after
resizing
it becomes
v dot size
it will print the size of the vector
after resizing okay
now
we use another function v dot empty for
that we have to use if condition
so we'll write
v dot empty
brackets
we know that if v dot empty equals true
then it means it is empty and if it
equals false then it means it is not
empty so we'll simply display the
message that
it is not empty
all right see out
and now we will
write
it slashing
not
empty
before go to
write the
commas over here okay
now
in else
we will write
it is empty
it is empty
we can also do this the other way around
like we can put widow tempt equals to
true and then inside that bracket we can
write it is empty but it's your choice
okay now
we'll display the elements of the vector
that we have to first
write the
message so we'll write
elements of vector
then after this using for loop and
iterator we will print those elements
so let's do this
we'll write for
and inside for loop we'll write
auto
id
here the auto keyword specifies the type
of variable that is being declared will
be automatically deducted from the
initializer and i t is the iterator
now we'll write i t equals v dot begin
and we know that v dot begin function
will point to the first element of the
vector
so
after that we'll write
i
t not equal to
v dot end
and it will point to the last element of
the vector
now i will write i t plus plus
now
we'll print the iterator using the
reference operator
and in order to make some space we'll
write this
now return
zero
okay now
let's try to run this
okay
here is the problem i think
now let's try one another time
here it is
size 10
after that after resizing it becomes 7
firstly we add the elements by pushing
one by one using the pushback function
10 elements were added so size is 10
after that we have resized it so after
resizing it becomes 7
and then we have used the function
empty
so it was not empty so that is why
the message display is not empty
then the elements of vector
before go to pits space over here
and elements of vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
and
that is correct
okay
now we'll do one example of iterator
in this example we'll simply
print the elements of a vector using
iterator
so first of all let's name this
stl2.cpp
now we'll write the header files
hash include iostream
in this will add three header files
now we'll write
hash include
iterator
because we have to use iterator so that
is why we are doing this
and we also have to use the vector so
we'll write hash include
vector
now we'll write namespace standard
now we'll start with int main
so first of all we'll declare a vector
in which there are some elements
as in previous question we already
learned how to add elements in a vector
so in this question we'll simply declare
those elements inside a vector
so we'll write vector
inside the angle brackets
now let's say ar is the name of this
vector
now we'll write the
elements
five five elements are there
now we have to declare iterator to a
vector so
this is how
we'll do it we'll write vector
then
the data type inside the angle brackets
then after this we'll write the scope
resolution operator
like this
now
iterator
keyword
then the name of the iterator that is
ptr
now we will display the vector elements
using for loop and using the functions
uh begin and end
so right
first of all we have to display a
message
okay
we'll write
the elements
of
vector
r
okay
now semicolon
now using for loop
we'll write
the ptr that is the iterator
ar
dot begin
as we know that ar is the name of the
vector
a r dot begin begin function will point
to the first element of the vector
then
p t r
less than
a r dot
end
we know end function
and function will point to the last
element of the vector
okay now we'll write
ar plus plus
sorry ptr plus plus
now we have to display it
and
we'll display it using the reference
operator
and the name of iterator that is ptr
make some space
now at last we'll write return zero
now let's try to run this
the elements of vector r as you can see
the elements of vector are one two three
four five
so this is how you can print the
elements of a vector using the iterator
here is the vector and with the help of
iterator we have printed these elements
one two three four five
now we'll do one simple example of
algorithm
first of all let's name this
stl three dot cpp
now in this example we'll use swap
algorithm
to swap two integers
and we know that swap is an template
function so let's do this
first of all we'll write
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
we'll start with int main
now first of all we declare a variable
let's say
seven and
second variable
let's say 10
first of all we'll display the value of
these variables that
before swapping and after swiping so
that is where
we will write
value of i
now here we'll write
value of j
and l
okay now we'll use the swap
algorithm
and here we'll mention
the elements we want to swap i comma j
it will simply swap the contents of
these two elements
now we will write
after swapping
and l
will do same for
j
this is a very basic example but we have
to see the functionality of it
we'll write
and l
okay
now we'll write return zero
now we'll run this
yeah
value of i
7 value of j is 10
after swapping i 10 j7
it will look
better if we have
root like this
let's make it look good
yeah value of is7 value of j is 10 after
swapping i becomes 10 and j becomes 7
so this is how we can swap the elements
using swap algorithm there are some more
algorithms you can try those as well
and now at last we'll do one example of
function object
let's name this as stl4.cpp
all right now
we'll add the header file
hash include iostream
now
we'll write namespace standard
now in this question first of all we'll
start with the function
first of all we'll make a class
class
function
obj
now we'll write access specifier public
hint
here we'll write the
call operator
as we know the syntax
operator bracket
then
another bracket
for the arguments
and x
comma and
y
so this is the syntax of it and now
whatever we want to do with these two
variables
let's say we want to multiply
so i'll write return x
into y
all right
as this is a class so we have to write
the semicolon
now we'll write int main
okay now i will write input after inpane
here we will write the name of the class
because
we have to define the object of it
now the object is
f4
so here class name is function obj
and its object is fo and as i have
explained earlier here i can use f4
object like a normal function because f4
is the object of class function obj in
which call operator is defined so it
will act like a normal function
so now
we'll make a variable let's say multiply
so we'll write mult equals f4
and because it acts like a normal
function so we'll pass the parameters
four and seven
now in order to display will write c out
and
we'll write
multiplication
of x
and y
is
now we'll write the name of the variable
mult
because
the result is getting stored in mult
variable
now
we'll write return 0
now let's try to run this
here we can see multiplication of x and
y is 28
and that is true 4 into 7
equals 28
so it is working and
this is the example of functor or
function object
so these were some basic examples of
components of stl you can practice some
more examples on them in order to learn
all right guys with that we have come to

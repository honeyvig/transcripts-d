you might have thought though we have a
forward propagation method why is there
need for back propagation why is it
important to learn back propagation well
I guarantee you that after watching this
video you will understand why back
propagation is needed and why it is
applied everywhere hey everyone I hope
you all are doing well and in this video
we will be looking in detail about back
propagation back propagation can be
called the building block of a neural
network and you'll understand why after
watching the complete video but before
we get started consider subscribing to

that Bell icon and that way you'll be
the first to get notified when we post
similar content
now let's move forward and look at what
the agenda is for today
first we'll look at what is back
propagation and after that what is back
propagation in a neural network next how
does back propagation in a neural
network work
and further we will understand benefits
of back propagation and finally
applications
but before moving forward let me ask you
a question which among the following is
not a neural network input layer output
layer propagation layer hidden layer
please leave your answer in the comments
section below and stay tuned to find the
answer
so what is a back propagation algorithm
back propagation is an algorithm which
is created to test errors which will
travel back from input nodes to Output
nodes it is applied to improve accuracy
in Data Mining and machine learning
coming to back propagation in neural
networks what is back propagation in
neural networks well the concept of back
propagation in neural networks was first
introduced in the 1960s an artificial
neural network is made up of Bunches of
connected input and output units Each of
which is connected by a software program
and has a certain weight
this kind of network is based on
biological neural networks which contain
neurons coupled to one another across
different network levels in this
instance neurons are shown as nodes well
now that we've understood what the back
propagation algorithm is we'll come to
the next topic the working of the back
propagation algorithm
so the back propagation algorithm is
applied to reduce cost function and to
reduce errors we have a sample network
with two hidden layers and a single
input layer where data passes in and
this data is finally received by the
output layer through all these neural
networks whenever we pass the data to
the input layer it will pass through the
neural network until it reaches the
output layer each model receives its
input from the previous layer and the
previous layer output is Multiplied with
weight which will give the activation
function or a and the result of this is
passed as an input for the next layer
and this process continues to happen
until we reach the output layer of each
neural network and this process is
referred to as forward propagation so
after reaching the output layer we get
the resulting output for the given model
from the input
output with the highest activation will
be considered as the suitable output
match for the corresponding input
loss is calculated on what the model has
predicted as input and what the actual
input is now here back propagation is
used to calculate the gradient of the
loss function in back propagation we are
coming back from the network and now we
have the output generated by the given
input now gradient descent looks at the
output layer and gradient descent
understands that the value of one output
increases and the other will decrease
we know that the output is derived from
the previous layer's output multiplied
by the weight of the network
back propagation is the tool that the
neural network considers in order to
calculate the gradient of the loss
function it is calculated by taking the
derivative of loss function by weight
and now we have the loss function
calculated from the previous layer now
gradient descent will start calculating
the value through the previous network
using back propagation with the aim of
reducing loss
we know that the value is coming from
the weighted sum of the previous Network
being multiplied by the output of the
previous layer and this process is
repeated until we update the value of
the previous sum
so as we can see we are going backwards
and from this we can increase the value
of the correct output node and decrease
the value of the incorrect input node
thus it will reduce the loss and the
activation function which has the
highest value should increase and the
lower value will decrease
do you remember the question that I
asked earlier and which among the
following is not a neural network well I
hope you got the answer by now the
answer for the question is propagation
layer
and to do this we need to change the
output of the previous layer we cannot
directly change it so we're going to
change its previous Network and why do
we need to choose back propagation well
below are some of the important factors
on why we need to choose back
propagation
so back propagation is quick easy and
simple to implement it is a versatile
method because it doesn't need prior
Network knowledge and only has input
numbers as parameters to tune
and there is no need to make any special
note of the characteristics of the
function that must be taught because it
is a common way that typically Works
effectively
and the final topic is applications of
back propagation
it can be used in the field of speech
recognition and it can also be used to
recognize voice and signature
the neural network has received training
to pronounce each letter in a word and a
sentence and the neural network has
received training therefore back
propagation finds itself in almost every
field where neural networks are used now

them in the comments section below and I
hope you enjoyed watching this video

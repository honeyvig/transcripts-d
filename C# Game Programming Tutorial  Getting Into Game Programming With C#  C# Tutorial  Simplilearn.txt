hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel today we will talk about
the interesting topics of c sharp that
is c sharp game programming but before
we begin let me tell you guys that we
have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn so in this c-sharp game
programming tutorial we'll make an
endless t-rex runner game so to begin
let us define the t-rex endless runner
class game
the google chrome dinosaur game also
known as the chrome dyno is a browser
game developed by google and integrated
into the google chrome web browser the
player must guide a pixelated t-rex
across a side-scrolling landscape to one
higher score avoiding obstacles the game
was created back in the year 2014 by
chrome user interface designers and it
is intended to be accessed by pressing
the space bar while google chrome is
closed or internet connectivity is lost
let's create a t-rex endless game runner
in a windows application
here's the preview so we have our t-rex
that has the animated running we jump
over the obstacles by pressing space
button and get the score accordingly
after that we can press t to continue or
restart the game so let's get started
with t-rex endless running game code
the system line indicates that you
utilize the system library in your
project this provides useful classes and
functions such as console class and
rightland function or method then a
generic collection is strongly typed it
can only hold one type of object to
eliminate runtime mismatches and improve
performance by avoiding boxing and
unboxing following that is the system
the component model includes classes and
implementing components and controls run
time and design time behavior the
following system data enables an object
to implement a data adapter and
represent a set of methods and mapping
action related properties used to fill
and update a useful data set and update
a data source
the system.drawing namespace contains
the classes that comprise microsoft next
generation graphics architecture that is
gdi plus as a result we have a
system.classes and an interface are
provided by support link queries the
following is a system the class
describes as some classes represent
ascii and unicode character encodings
abstract base classes for converting
blocks of characters to and from blocks
of bytes and a helper class that
manipulates and formats string objects
without creating intermediate instances
of string then there's a
system.threading the task provides types
that makes writing concurrent and
asynchronous code easier finally we have
a system.windows windows forms as
graphical user interface class library
framework for the internet
its primary goal is to provide a simple
interface for developing desktop tablet
and pc applications it is also known as
when forms
then we have the namespace t-rex runner
followed by the form name trx1
first we have a false variable which has
a data boolean and is used to determine
whether or not the player is jumping
this is a boolean expression called jump
this boolean will be used to determine
whether or not the t-rex has entered the
game we can only toggle between true and
false next we have a jumping speed of 10
this integer is known as jumping speed
this will have a value of 10 the t-rex
runner will jump 10 pixels from the
current location and use the jump speed
as gravity to pull the player down
following that we have the frc variable
equal to 12 this integer frc will be
used to determine how quickly the t-rex
jumps up and how high he can go before
collapsing next there will be an integer
variable called this call the score of
this game which will describe the score
of the game which is set to 0 by default
after that we set int object speed to
10. this is the default speed for the
obstacles the obstacles will be animated
using this integer this will draw the
obstacles to the left of the screen
closer to the player the random variable
comes next we made a new class at random
this random number generator is also
known as random which is used to
calculate the random location of the
obstacle spun once in the game begins
and when they reach far to the left of
the screen
following that we have the pos variable
or the position variable which defines
the t-rex's position
finally we have the game over the true
boolean variable which is by default set
to false and indicates whether or not
the game is over
following that we have the t-rex one
function
which includes the initialize component
function in visualstudio.net c-sharp or
vb.net the initialize component method
is a method that is automatically
created and managed by the windows forms
designer and defines everything you see
on the form
everything you do on the form in
vs.net web designers generates the code
next we have the main function of the
form called the reset function this
means instructing the reset function to
execute when the game begins which will
define in greater detail later
next we have a trx game event linked to
the game timer first we connected the
jumping speed integer to the player
picture boxes at the top of the screen
and then we displayed the score on the
score text label after that if the jump
is true and the force is less than 0 the
jump is changed to false another
condition states that if the jump is
true the jumping speed should be -12 and
the forces frc should be reduced by 1
otherwise the jumping speed should be 12
then we have the forage loop which is
for the obstacle which we have to in
this condition as if it is a picture box
and it has an obstacle tag we need to
move the obstacles to the left another
condition is that if the obstacles have
vanished from the screen we respawn them
from the far right in this case we
calculate the form width and the random
number between 200 and 500 then add 1 to
the score after that if the t-rex
collides with the obstacles we stop the
timer change the t-rex image to the dead
one and display a message that says
press t to restart on the score text
label and now that we know the game is
over and we change from false to true if
the score of the game is greater than 5
we will increase the obstacle speed from
12 to 15 to make it little more
interesting
a following key is down event
in this function we check if the space
key is pressed and if the jump equals to
false we set the jump back to false it
may appear simple but we are triggering
the jump function which will be used
later in the timer event and the next
function in the key is the up function
first we check if the t key is pressed
and released and then we run the game
reset function we also check if the jump
is true and then we change the jump back
to false finally we have the reset
function overall this function will
reset every variable player and obstacle
in the game this function will be
executed when the game first loads and
then when the player presses the t
button
let's take a look at how to do it first
set the variable that is frc variable to
12 and then set the jumping speed to 0
after that change the jump to false the
gamer score to 0 the obstacle speed to
10 and score text to show the gamer
score next set the t-rex image to
running the game over variable gain to
false and the t-rex top to 367
again we have a loop for each of our two
obstacles represented by a counter
variable t in this for each loop we have
a same condition as t
which is that if the obstacle is a
picture box with the tag of the obstacle
and we generate a random number in the
position integer between 500 and 800 we
change the obstacle's left position to a
random location at the start of the game
now let's quickly execute this program
and see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and you can see
the game now press spacebar
okay let's press t
now you have to hold the spacebar and
make the jump
so again let's press t
press spacebar and hold it
so this is how the game is played
now let's quickly close it
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on game programming using c
sharp if you have any queries regarding
any of the topics covered in this
session or if you need the code that we
executed in this particular session then

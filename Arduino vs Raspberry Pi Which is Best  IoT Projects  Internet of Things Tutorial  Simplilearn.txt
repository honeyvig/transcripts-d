hello everyone welcome to another video
by simply learn
in this video we will see arduino vs
raspberry pi
let us look at today's agenda
we'll first start with understanding
what is arduino
after that we will look at what is
raspberry pi
then we will see a comparison between
arduino vs raspberry pi on the following
parameters
control unit
architecture
specifications
operating system licensing applications
and types of boards
and at last we will see which is better
arduino or raspberry pi
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn so
without wasting any further time let's
get started
what is arduino
arduino is an open source electronic
gadget that reads inputs such as light
on a sensor a finger on a button or a
tweet and generates output based on
those inputs such as turning on the led
or activating a motor
arduino was created at a design
institute as a simple tool for students
with no prior experience with
electronics and programming
arduino boards are microcontrollers not
entire computers with operating systems
of their own like the raspberry pi
arduino just run c c plus plus code that
is stored in the firmware
the arduino ide integrated development
environment is free software that allows
you to create and upload code to an
arduino board
now let us see what is raspberry pi
raspberry pi is small low cost computer
the size of a credit card that connects
to a computer monitor or television and
utilizes a conventional keyboard and a
mouse
raspberry pi can do everything a desktop
computer does including accessing the
internet
using raspberry pi we can watch high
definition videos access spreadsheets
word processing and play games
raspberry pi has a dedicated processor
memory and a graphics driver just like a
pc it also comes with its own operating
system raspberry pi operating system
which is a modified version of linux
raspberry pi is also used in music
machines parent detectors as well as
weather stations and tweeting bird
houses with infrared cameras
let us look at the comparison between
arduino versus raspberry pi first let us
look at the control unit
arduino is a member of atmega family of
microcontrollers
microcontroller chip common on arduino
uno boats is atmega328
the 8-bit
avr microcontroller family includes
atmega328 microcontrollers
a surface mount at mega chip is seen on
some arduino uno boards
the raspberry pi is an arm controller
unit
broadcom chips based on arms cortex a
application processor have powered
raspberry pi from its release
the raspberry pi 3 is the latest version
of the raspberry pi launched in february
2016.
it has 1.2 gigahertz arm cortex a53 cpu
making it compatible for the arm 63.
it has 1.2 gigahertz arm cortex a53 cpu
making it compatible for the arm 64
architecture
architecture
the harvard architecture is used by
arduino cpu which means that the program
code and the program data have distinct
memory
it is made up of two types of memories
program memory and data memory
the data is saved in the data memory
while the code is kept in the flash
program memory
whereas in raspberry pi raspberry pi
contains a single core arm v6 processor
running at 700 megahertz
a video core 4 gpu and 512 mb of ram
its operating system and data are stored
on sd card
raspbian a lightweight linux operating
system based on debian is officially
supported by the raspberry pi
licensing
arduino is an open source electronics
platform that uses simple hardware and
software to make it easy to use
it's for everyone who wants to make
interactive projects
arduino perceives the environment by
receiving data from a variety of sensors
and actuators to influence its
surroundings
raspberry pi's hardware and software are
both proprietary raspberry pi has never
claimed to be open source
many aspects of it particularly the
software are open source but not all of
it is
the raspberry pi has been criticized for
having closed source components
operating system
arduino boards are single board
microcontrollers with firmware and no
operating system
a firmware program is a piece of
software that is installed on hardware
device
it doesn't have an operating system but
it does have a firmware which can be
programmed using several ides including
the arduino ide
raspberry pi operating system for pc and
mac is dbn with raspberry pi desktop
it installs a raspberry pi operating
system desktop on pc or apple mac as
well as most of the recommended software
that comes with raspberry pi operating
system
now let us look at the specifications
so we look at the specifications between
arduino uno r3 and raspberry pi 3 model
b plus
so if you look at the system arduino has
microcontroller system whereas raspberry
pi has single boarded computer processor
arduino has avr at mega 328p
and raspberry pi has broadcom
ram
in arduino uno we have ram of 2 kb
whereas in raspberry pi model 3 b plus
we have 1gb ram
clock speed 16 megahertz in arduino and
1.4 gigahertz in raspberry path
execution in arduino single program can
be executed at a time
whereas in raspberry pi multiple
programs can run at a time
current
current is 5 milli ampere in both
arduino and raspberry pi and gpu io pins
arduino has 20 and raspberry pi has 40.
and power consumption in arduino is 175
milli watt and in raspberry pi it is 700
milli watt
applications
arduino is used in waving machines
traffic light countdown timer parking
lot counter embedded systems home
automation industrial automation medical
instrument and emergency light for
railways
whereas raspberry pi is used in desktop
pc wireless usage game servers retro
gaming machine robot controller
stop-motion camera and time-lapse camera
now let us look at the different types
of arduino and raspberry pi
in arduino we have arduino uno
lily pad arduino arduino mega arduino
leonardo arduino red board and arduino
shields
whereas in raspberry pi
we have raspberry pi one model b
raspberry pi 1 model a
model b plus model a plus
then we have raspberry pi 0 raspberry pi
2 raspberry pi 0 w and raspberry pi 3
model b
and we know a raspberry pi which is
better the arduino and raspberry pi have
their own set of benefits and drawbacks
the best option for you will be
determined by the requirement of your
project and your budget
arduino is ideal for automating
repetitive operations such as opening
and closing doors turning on and off
lights and so on
arduino should be the first pick if your
project has any repeating elements and
just requires generating output
depending on sensory inputs
raspberry pi is ideally suited for
complex activities such as controlling
complex robots weather monitoring and
internet publishing among others if your
project necessitates advanced
functionality as well as internet access
then the raspberry pi is the option
so with that we have reached the end of

hi my name is Xiao Ying I'm the Senior
Program Manager for Azure death has
slabs the commercial as a service that
helps developers and testers to quickly
create environments while minimizing
waste in controlling cost in this video
I'm going to show you all the key
features with ship since the connect
conference last November before jump
there in case you haven't heard about
dev test labs please allow me spend a
couple minutes explaining what it is
that has labs aims at solving the real
problem in dev testing arrow that has
investments are usually significant when
we talk to most traditional IT
organizations we realize that up to 50%
of their infrastructure spending is
happening on non production environments
furthermore neither IT nor developers
are very happy about their provisioning
experience 65% of developers say that is
too complicated and time-consuming it
takes weeks to get infrastructure for
that test sometimes not even enough for
testing and there's a lot of unused
resources what is the case the demand
for death has infrastructure is a linear
it typically looks like this spiky grass
when devs are working on Springs you see
Peaks when there is off time like night
weekends or holidays
you see valleys and when there is a
release the demand for test environments
is high so you see a bit peak if you're
provisioning infrastructure in a
traditional way here's what you do
results in 80% of wastage that's a lot
of good money being put to bad use
however when you use Azure you can map
your infrastructure spending closely to
your needs pay for the use only and
enjoy cost savings with Azure being the
only cloud that does per minute billing
for VMs you only pay for what we used
more importantly lightning-fast
provisioning and automation
improves productivity driving top-line
business value for to quickly get
started with theft has environment here
we have solution called
dev test labs it's in out-of-the-box
solution that won't getting any other
cloud
it empowers our developers and gives the
cost control and governance that your IT
ones dentists Labs is a good for
multiple scenarios including hosting
your developer machines test
environments and beyond them testing
arrows it's also good for training
education scenario and trowel hexam or
demos in arrow as well now let's talk a
little bit more about these narrows one
by one first developer machines because
that has elapsed make it super easy for
IT teams to enable cost controlled
self-service environments for developer
teams developers have the flexibility to
quickly compose their own development
machines on demand by using the reusable
templates and artifacts under the
policies defined by the IT team the
needs are satisfied from both sides the
IT team gets the control and developers
are happy about agility similarly you
can test the latest version of your
application by quickly provisioning
Windows and Linux environments using
reusable templates and artifacts that
says labs provides a rich set of API is
in permit VSDs tasks that help you to
easily integrate with your deployment
pipeline to provision only mul
environments you can also scale up your
load testing by provisioning multiple
test agents in the lab once the testing
is done you can also create your golden
image from test machines and make the
image available immediately for all the
lab users through a single step as
mentioned earlier in addition to dev
test environment you can also create pre
prevention environments for training and
demos in the classroom scenario a set of
identical VMs are created in a shared VM
pool before the class starts students in
the class simply click a button together
VMs needed all the VMS can be
automatically clean up after the class
similarly in the trowel hack phone or
demo scenario lab users pick a machine
from the VM pool in dev test labs if
needed
once this event is over the lab can
automatically clean up all the VMS for
next event so at this point I've talked
about what is step
have in how they can help you in various
narrows before talking about new
features let me quickly walk you through
the core capabilities in dentists laughs
you're destined slab is created from as
your marketplace once created you can
use and manages through either Azure
portal or api's here are logging Azure
portal in open one of my favorite dev
test lab as a lab user that is granted
with dev test labs user role I can cream
as VMs or environments with past
resources from a set of reusable
templates under the policies defined by
malleable me once created a VM I can
start stop or connect to the VM apply
artifacts in film or software or attach
my data disks that contains my latest
source code or test data as an owner or
admin of the lab Delta slabs gives me
full control to deform the lab policies
including allowed VM sizes maximum
numbers of VMs each user or lab can keep
at the same time auto shutdown and auto
start identified were usable templates
for my lab users to create VMS including
arm templates added through my git
repository my selection of azure
marketplace images in the custom images
I can also monitor the current spending
in the lab check the projection defy my
cost target income range and get
notification when there is a risk of
overspending when I see a red flag a
list of cost by resources reviews more
details on the usage in each resource ok
now let's look at what's new since the
connect conferencing last November the
first big thing we've shipped recently
is to support managed disks in creation
of VMs cut images and data disks in
desert labs before they support because
of if's limits in a single start account
for optimized performance ESS labs
create VM OS disks in additional start
account when they are already many VMs
using the same start account in addition
because creating VMs from a cousin image
VHD in a different storage account can
takes a long time usually around 40 or
even 60 minutes in order to optimize
the VM creation the same custom image
VSD is replicated to all the new storage
accounts with managed disk support this
flow is significantly simplified as its
name indicates all manage these
resources are automatically managed by a
j''r instead of the start account in
your subscription you don't need to
manage any storage accounts anymore and
all the VMS can be created from the same
cutting image VHD file another key
experience will be enabled dentist Labs
is claimable viens with this lab Allah
means can prepare VMs and put them in a
shared VM pool lab users can then take a
vm from the pool to use without spending
any time to create it from scratch this
is very helpful for a couple of
different scenarios in test narrows
claimable VMs that are installed with
the latest build for testing can be
generated automatically from the release
pipeline developers and testers can then
start using the latest build immediately
for further testing or validation
trimmable VMs also make it easier for
trainers and teachers to get all VMs
ready before class because all the VMS
for the same class are identical
students can ask the lab to print any vm
for them at the beginning of the class
once claimed the VM will automatically
start up for students to use during the
class that test labs also supports
creation of multiple identical games for
the same VM image and artifacts all at
once the only additional thing you need
to do is to provide the number of the VM
instances where you create a VM in order
to make VM cleanup easier now can also
set time when you create a VM to expire
it automatically at the specified
expiration time dentist labs
automatically deliver VM by using it
together with cream above VMs you can
fully focus on creating the right VM
without taking any actual effort to
manage the VM retirement in the case
that a lot of public facing VMs needed
to be created in the lab temp test labs
provides a solution to share the same
public IP address with those VMs
it can help you reduce costs and avoid
exceeding the public IP oh just call de
in you're a sure subscription what you
need to do is simply choosing an IP
configuration option to use a shared
public IP address in the lab will do all
the remaining work for you now let's get
back to my lab and see how these
features work in practice at the bottom
of the overview page is a lab user I can
see a list of claimable VMs for me to
choose I can also view all the claim of
VMs through the claim above virtual
machines page if all the VM started
saying such as in the case of classroom
scenario
the only thing I need to do to get a VM
is to click the claim any button on the
top of the page if I need a particular
VM from the pool it's also very easy
I think please select the VM I'm
interested in and click the cling
machine button the selected VM would
then be moved to my virtual machine list
and automatically turn on if it's
stopped now let's create some claimable
VMs it's also very straightforward what
I need to do is to go through the same
VM creation flow as creating a VM for
myself I start with choosing a base from
different types of templates supporting
the lab including arm templates formulas
custom images and azure marketplace
images then I fill in my desired values
for some properties such as the VM name
username and password VM size and
artifacts
the only difference from creating my own
DM is to specify some advanced settings
here what I need to do is to switch the
claim options toggle
I can do more things in advanced
settings let's say I want to create 5 km
of VMs with the same configuration for a
small group of people and those VMs
cannot be used after the end of next
week to achieve that I give the number
of instances as five instead expiration
date for all these lives it means that
the midnight is next Saturday all these
VMs will be automatically deleted
regardless whether they've been claimed
by
buddy or still in the claimable pool
here you can see that the default IP
address configuration is shared which
means that all these five VMs will be
created with the same puppy IP address
if the share public IP address has
already been created in the lab these
VMs will use that one
otherwise the lab will create a new
public IP address for them at this point
I'm good to click the Create button and
kick off the creation for these five
years that share the same puppy IP
address it will be expired at midnight
of next Saturday once created these
claimable VMs will be automatically shut
down and wait for lab users to claim it
now let's talk a little bit more about
the shared public IP address well
understand that not all the
organizations allow the VMS accessible
through the internet there are also
cases where shared public IP address is
not desired in your scenario at all
so left has Labs provides flexible
settings for level means to define which
IP address configuration is allowed in
the lab in the lab version network
settings leather means can select the
virtual network in the subnet to change
the options they allow their lab users
to use including whether the subnet can
be using this lab for creating VMs
whether shared public address is allowed
and whether each lab VM is allowed to be
created within exclusive public IP
address
once the VM uses a Sherpa VIP in the lab
it will be automatically assigned to a
unique port number which will be used
together with the sheer public IP
address when you connect to that VM you
can see which IP address and port number
to use from the essential section on the
selected lab VMs page or for Windows VM
just click the connect button on top of
the page to get a RDP file that contains
all the required info directory it's a
quick recap in this video we've talked
about the new features available in that
ASAPS
and how it can help you in multiple
scenarios to enable a secured
self-service experience with fast easy
and agile dev tests or training

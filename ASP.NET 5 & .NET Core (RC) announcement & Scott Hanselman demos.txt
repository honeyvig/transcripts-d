>> Scott G.: What I'd like to do is 
actually start off this event with
some cool demos. And I'd like to
invite Scott Hanselman on stage
to actually show off both what you
can do with VS 2015, as well
as highlight a whole bunch of new
capabilities that we're excited
to bring to market for the first time
as part of this week's announcement.
So here's Scott.
[Applause]
>> Scott H.: Cool.
Thank you, sir. So today we're going
to be showing a whole series
of demos based on a health clinic theme.
We'll be using healthcare throughout.
Everything will be based on this health
clinic. In this particular
application, it's going to be the public
facing app for the health clinic.
And this has been written in ASP.NET
5 using the .NET Core CLR.
And this is kind of a Hello World
demo you've seen before, and
I'll go run this app. You'll see
what you've usually seen.
This is a standard the Hello World.
And now of course ASP.NET
5 is open source and .NET Core
is open source. We use a lots
and lots of open source at Microsoft.
And, in fact, I can usually
bring in additional open source.
From Visual Studio, I'll say
Manage NuGet Packages. NuGet is where
.NET service side libraries
come from. You can see a number
of popular ones there. But I'm
going to try to bring in a
library called RequireJS.
This is a JavaScript library. It's
a client side library that
people use in other platforms.
And you'll notice here that in
Visual Studio Update 1, it's actually
promoting that I use Bower instead.
Bower is a package manager that's appropriate
for client side technology.
So now we've got tooling within
VS for me to go and bring in
that JavaScript library. And you'll
notice here on the side Bower
and MPM are both available as package
manager options. And now
I've brought RequireJS to that
client side loader. So we've
got all that rich tooling for technologies
that people want to use.
Now, I want this Hello World app
to look a little bit prettier.
So I'm just going to pick these
up, some existing assets, and
drop them in and then replace. And
then I'll come over here to
Edge and I'll hit refresh. And then
the front end of my application
looks nice. And that kind of make a
change and hit refresh experience
is what you would expect with static
things like CSS and JavaScript.
But I can also go back into Visual
Studio and look for the home
controller, for example. And I'll
grab some actual C# and I'll
make a change to the code,
best health clinic ever.
And then I'm just going to hit
save. But I'm not going to do
a build. I'm going to come back
into Edge and then hit refresh.
When we go over to the About page,
it's actually recompiled that app.
So I can have that kind of make changes
to code and hit refresh.
Make changes to code and hit refresh.
The experience you'd expect
with a Ruby or Node, but you're
getting that with the power of
C# and Core CLR. That actually compiled
the application itself.
So Visual Studio didn't do the compilation;
ASP.NET did the compilation.
And that's going to enable us to
do that across platform as well.
A really nice experience. This application
is going to need diagnostics
and telemetry. I'm going to bring
in Application Insights.
And this is going to send all the
performance and availability
and diagnostics information and send
that telemetry up into the cloud.
So as I run this application, if
errors occur, exceptions happen,
either in JavaScript or in .NET, that
will be sent off to the cloud.
So we'll right click and hit publish.
And we're going to send
this to the East U.S. We've got
datacenters all over the world.
In this case we're going to send
this one to the East U.S.
While that's happening, I'll run
over into the Azure dashboard,
and there's a thing called Traffic
Manager that allows me to
do geographically load balanced
systems. We have this not just
in the East US but also North Europe
and Brazil all at the same time.
So this public facing website is now
suddenly available everywhere.
What can I do with that, it just
got published, it popped up.
I'll switch back over to the dashboard
and pick that website
and click on tools here because I want
to do some performance testing.
Now that I have a scaleable website
that's been sent all over
the world, I'm going to performance
test it. And I'm going to
do that using the power of the
cloud to create that load.
We're going to generate load from
the East U.S. And with Azure
and Visual Studio Online we're
going to collect a whole bunch
of computers that are going to
now start hitting that machine
and generate load. That's going to
take a few moments to start up.
So I'll show you some load that I
generated just a few minutes ago.
You can see here we had 130,000
successful hits. I can see how
many requests a second. We're hitting
that sight. So already
I know that I'm going to have a great
experience no matter where
in the world that we are. And all
of that information is being
sent into Application Insights. Now,
I can look at that Application
Insights diagnostics
and telemetry in
Azure, but also I like spending
time in Visual Studio and with
Visual Studio Update 1 we have included
the ability to look at
that telemetry from within
the IDE itself.
So I'm going to come in here and bring
up the Application Insights
search and look at the time range
over the last few hours to
see that telemetry data. And here
I've got all this information
that I can query and see page views,
what browser it used, where
the data came from. Look at time ranges.
I can dig in on individual
page views and see all the detail,
both server side and client
side, and query that richness of
the telemetry. But I can do
it from inside Visual Studio. So
you can see that with ASP.NET
.NET Core and Azure and Application
Insights I've got everything
that I need in one place.
>> Scott G.: Great.
Thanks, Scott.
Excited to announce today some
of the things that Scott also
showed there in terms of the ability
to use the new ASP.NET 5
based on the new .NET Core runtime
that enable a bunch of new
capabilities, including the dynamic
compilation, that we're releasing
the release candidate of both of
those technologies this morning.
And they're now available for you
to go ahead and take advantage
of and use.
And what's great about the release
candidate is not only can
you download them, build apps with
them, they also include a
Go live license and enables you
to also now start to go into
production and start deploy real
apps to real customers using
all those technologies. Let's take
a look at what you can do
now with the new support that's cross
platform. So here's Scott.
>> Scott H: Thanks. I liked that little
bit applause when we talked
about how we can get this to run everywhere.
I hope you enjoy this.
I'm going to go right click, say
publish again. When we publish
something to Windows, we can go
to Azure, we can go to IS, when
we publish to Linux, you'll not necessarily
FTP that up to Linux,
you'll send it maybe up to Docker
in a container. You can notice
here, when I hit publish in Visual
Studio, that Docker appears
in the list there. It's first class
inside of Visual Studio.
So I've gone and said publish to
take the exact same ASP.NET
5 application running on the .NET
Core RC1 and I'm going to send
this now up to Azure on a Linux
VM with Docker inside. This is
using the same Docker tools we
already know how to use.
Just like we saw that integration
with Bower, a tool that people
know how to use at the command line,
here's an example of using
Docker, another tool we know at
the command line. I'm going
to bring up the command line. And
in fact I'm going to use the
new SSH client that you may have
heard we're going to be shipping
with Windows. Little tiny clap
for that. Appreciate that.
[Applause]
So what we're going to go and SSH
into this machine over here.
This is now switching from the command
line now. We are looking
at Ubuntu running in Azure. I'm
going to hit top to prove it.
You can see Docker right there using
up some CPU as Visual Studio
is sending that up to Docker and
that build is being sent.
And that Docker container is going
to be one of these images.
Those are Docker images. You can
see here's my health coming
in here. I can say Docker PS A.
Just 14 seconds ago was created
the image called My Health and
in the background, in the bottom
left, you can see Visual Studio
trying to talk to Docker to get
that fired up. That is going
to be a version of this exact same
website. So I can publish
to the operating system of the
choice that I have, publish to
the container that makes me happy.
And in this case that's going
to pop up. Now this again has been
kind of a Hello World demo.
Sometimes when we see Hello Worlds
we're not really impressed.
We're like okay there
it is. Hello World.
But we are not joking when we say
this is ready today. This is
a Hello World demo. Let's see a
more advanced one. Let's see
the private section of this health
clinic with authentication,
with SQL and entity framework with
Linux talking to SQL Server.
This is real data on a real app,
running in Docker. Now, you
could run one app on one VM in
one Docker container, but in a
real sophisticated production environment
you might start including
things like many Docker containers
on many virtual machines.
This is in fact running in a cluster
of virtual machines running
multiple Docker containers. And
we managed all of that with the
Azure Container Service. That takes
care of all the complexities
of creating all of those containers.
And then I can go and layer
on top of that and include technologies
like Mesos or Marathon
to manage them. So I'm getting
to use the technologies that I
want to use on the cloud
that makes me happy.
So hopefully that gets you excited.
You can go and make this happen.
You can start writing apps with
ASP.NET and C# and putting it
on Docker containers and Linux today.
Start doing that now. This is some
of the stuff we're doing today.
Let's take a moment and talk about
the potential for tomorrow.
So I'm going to switch to
another machine here.
Here we go. So here I'm on an Ubuntu
machine, and I'm going to
look in this folder and see that
I've got some C# code there.
And, you know, wouldn't it be nice
if at some point in the future
I could do something like App Get
and ask Linux for .NET and
be rest assured that .NET was there
and ready for me; and wouldn't
it be nice if I could say something
like .NET compile and then
compile a .NET application and
run this on Linux. This is a
preview of some of the work that
we're going to see early next
year where .NET and the .NET command
line here is going to allow
us to go and run an application like
this with a .NET Core on Ubuntu.
Now, this example
is the .NET that you know and love.
This is the .NET where we've
created a DLL and we have a Jitter
and we have a garbage collector
and all that. But wouldn't it be
nice if I could do something
like this and say dash dash native and
use that .NET Native technology
that you're familiar with for Windows
that makes Windows universal
apps so nice. I'm going to go
add dash dash native there.
And I'm going to compile the application,
same exact application,
same compiler same command line .NET
compiler. There's the original
one and there's to be clear a statically
linked, no dependency
required, native code application
compiled from C#.
And when I run it,
it's fast because it's native code
running on Linux that was
compiled with the open
source .NET Core
and this is where you applaud.
[Applause]
I know it takes a moment to absorb.
But that's a big deal.
So I'm going to go ahead and just
pull that applause from you.
So this is some of the future work
that we're doing. But I want
you to know that you can take .NET Core RC1
today and start building applications.
You can deploy them in Docker, deploy
them on Linux, Ubuntu and
Red Hat, and put them in Azure.
And I hope you have as much fun
working with it as we
had building it.
>> Thanks, Scott.

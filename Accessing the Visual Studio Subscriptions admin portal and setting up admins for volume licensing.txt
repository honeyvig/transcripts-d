- [Narrator] Accessing the Visual Studio
Subscriptions Admin Portal
and setting up admins for
volume licensing agreements.
Welcome to the Visual Studio
Subscriptions Admin Portal.
In this portal, admins can manage
their organization's Visual
Studio subscriptions.
If you're the primary or notices contact
for your organization's
volume license agreement,
you'll receive super admin
access to the portal by default.
When you receive your welcome email,
it will indicate which
email address to use
to sign into the portal.

Once you're signed in,
select the Manage Admins tab.
Here you'll see that you're a super admin,
allowing you to control admin access
to subscription management
and agreement level preferences.
As a super admin, you can add other admins
to help with the assignment and management
of your organization's
Visual Studio subscriptions.
You can assign them to a
super admin role, like you,
or just an admin role.
Once you've set up your admins,
they'll receive an email
letting them know that
they can access the portal
and begin managing subscriptions.
As a super admin,
you can select the gear
icon from the flyout panel
to choose agreement level preferences,
such as adding a contact email,
setting default subscription levels,
download settings, and more.
Your selections will automatically
populate for your admins
when they're assigning subscriptions,
making the assignment process
more streamlined for them.

hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will learn
everything we need to know about the
asp.net lifecycle
first let's have a look at the agenda
for today's session
we shall begin with learning the basics
of asp.net
then we shall go on to learn the asp.net
lifecycle
by learning about the life cycle we
shall focus on two different types of
asp.net lifecycle the application life
cycle and the paid life cycle
but before we begin
make sure you're subscribed to our
youtube channel and click on the bell
icon so you never miss an update from
simplylearn
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is asp.net
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing dynamic web applications
it is the latest version of active
server pages
active server pages is a server-side
scripting language and engine used for
developing web applications
it is essentially a web-based platform
that helps to create dynamic web pages
for programmers
asp.net produces interactive data-driven
web applications on the internet which
helps to build websites and web
applications in a better and colorful
way
now when we know what is asp.net it is
time to move on to the lifecycle of
asp.net
asp.net lifecycle is very crucial when
it comes to developing applications
the life cycle includes two different
stages that help in producing dynamic
outputs
these two stages together are known as
the asp.net lifecycle the two stages in
which the life cycle is divided are
application life cycle and the page life
cycle
now we shall have a look at both of
these types in detail
first let's have a look at the
application lifecycle
application lifecycle is the part that
starts when the user makes a request
these requests involve several stages
and these stages are
application start
object creation
http application
dispose and application end
let's have a look at each of these steps
in detail
the first step we have is application
start
whenever a user requests an application
for accessing a web server
first the request is checked and then
the request for accessing it is provided
the second stage we have is the object
creation
object creation helps in holding all the
information about the request cookies
and browsing information
it also holds http context http request
and http response by the browser
the third stage is the http application
http application holds back all the
subsequent information
sent back to the user by the web driver
for example if we have two different
applications like one is a gaming
application and the other one is a
social media application
then that means there will be two http
applications that are to be created to
process the application
the fourth stage is dispose
dispose helps in erasing the unmanaged
resources when the objects are no longer
needed moving forth the last and the
final stage is the application end
application end helps to unload the
memory of an application
here unloading memory means cleaning up
the unwanted files in the application
now when we know about the application
lifecycle let's have a look at the page
lifecycle
page lifecycle includes initialization
restoring and execution
when an asp.net page is called it goes
through some phases before the response
is sent to the user
let's have a look at the phases involved
in the page lifecycle beginning with
page request
then comes page start
page initialization
page load
validation
event handling rendering and unload
let's have a look at all these steps in
detail
the first phase of the page lifecycle is
page request
when the user requests a page the server
checks the request
compiles the page and responds to the
user
if the page is requested several times
then the cache will check the request to
see if the output exists or not
and after that it will send a response
back to the user
the second phase is paid start paid
start holds two objects
request and response
the request holds all the information
which was sent when the page was
requested
and the response holds all the
information sent back to the user
the third phase is the page
initialization phase
during the page initialization phase all
controls are initialized and each
controller is provided with a specific
id in the page initialization phase
themes are also applied to the
applications
the fourth phase is page load
in this phase the application is
provided with some control properties
and the information is also set using
view state and control state the fifth
phase of the page lifecycle is
validation
when a page is executed the result of
those pages are provided in the form of
two conditions
true and false
if the execution goes successful the
result is true
while if there is an error in execution
it returns false
the sixth phase in the life cycle is
event handling
this phase is the response to the
validation phase
in this phase pages are loaded again and
display the same information
in order to overcome this a post back
event is called
this event helps in checking the
credentials of the user
the seventh phase of the life cycle is
rendering it occurs when all the
response information has been sent back
to the user
the phase also stores all the
information that is being sent
the eighth and the final stage of the
page lifecycle is unload
unload
helps to clean all the unwanted
information of an application
it also cleans the memory once the
output is sent back to the user

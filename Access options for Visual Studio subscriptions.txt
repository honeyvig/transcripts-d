>> Access Options for
Visual Studio Subscriptions.
There are two main options
your subscribers have
for accessing their Visual
Studio subscriptions.
This video will explain
Microsoft accounts and
work or school accounts,
which are a feature of managed tenants
like Microsoft 365 or
Azure Active Directory.
We'll also show the impacts
of choosing a type of account
for your subscribers
and some of the benefits that
come with managed tenants
such as improved security
and ease of subscription management.
What is a Microsoft account or MSA?
The Microsoft account,
commonly referred to as an MSA,
is a personal email account
owned by an individual
to access Microsoft services
when an organization isn't
using a managed tenant
for M365 or Azure AD.
An MSA is set up by the individual
and maintained by the individual.
For example, Kai may have set up
kai.carter20@outlook.com
as his MSA.
This would be created, owned,
and maintained by him.
Why would subscribers need an MSA?
Companies use MSAs when they're not using
managed services by Microsoft,
such as M365 or Azure AD,
or if they're using managed services
from other companies.
For example.
Kai Carter was assigned a subscription
by his company, Contoso.
His admin assigned it
to his company email,
kai@contoso.com.
However, Kai needs to make it an MSA
because Contoso is not yet
using Azure AD or M365.
kai@contoso.com
is owned and managed
on-premise by Contoso,
so an MSA needs to be created for Kai
to access his subscription.
Are there governance
risks to using an MSA?
Since MSAs are owned by an individual,
any policies you've defined
for account security,
like password strength,
won't apply to that MSA.
Additionally, if the individual
is no longer with the company,
they can still access
services that are connected
to their identity.
For example, if Wesley
Brooks used his own MSA,
wesley.brooks01@outlook.com,
to assign Visual Studio subscriptions
and manage admins,
he would still be able to do this
even after he leaves the company
if his account is not removed
from the Visual Studio
Subscriptions admin portal,
Wesley owns this email address
and will continue to own it
even after he leaves.
This can pose a security
risk to your company
if the user maintains unauthorized access
to confidential information.
What can I do about it?
Consider transitioning your
users to a managed tenant,
such as Azure AD or M365,
as well as making sure
that your subscribers
choose a work or school account
when signing into their
subscription for the first time.
What is a managed tenant?
A managed tenant is a
cloud-based directory
that allows the organization
to have end-to-end control
over the user's access
to Microsoft services.
This can be achieved in a couple of ways
through hybrid or full cloud solutions,
such as M365 or Azure AD.
The organization has full
control of the email address
and can manage access this way.
Why does this matter?
Unlike MSAs, managed
tenants allow your company
to have increased governance
and full control over a user's access.
For example,
let's say that Wesley Brooks is an admin
and uses wesley@fabrikam.com
to manage Visual Studio
subscriptions and admins.
When Wesley leaves Fabrikam,
as soon as his email
address is deactivated,
he no longer has access to sensitive
or confidential information
like product keys,
Azure resources, and more.
Wesley also doesn't have
the task of setting up
and maintaining his own email account
as he would with an MSA.
Since the sign-in and security
for Wesley's email address
is within M365 and entirely
in the control of his company,
once his account is deactivated,
he loses access to cloud services.
Is it possible for
subscribers to use an M365
or Azure AD work email for their MSA?
Yes,
your subscribers can create an MSA
out of their work email.
For example, Hannah could
have an email address
assigned to her by her company,
such as hannah@fabrikam.com.
When she's setting it up,
Hannah should choose the option
to sign in with a work or school account
if the organization is
using a managed tenant
like M365 or Azure AD.
If she chooses a personal account,
then she will be creating an MSA.
This means that even if
Hannah left Fabrikam,
and she'd used that
email address as an MSA
to sign into other services,
such as Visual Studio Subscriptions,
that would still be her user sign-in.
How do managed tenants
make Visual Studio
subscription management easier?
Using an M365 or Azure
AD work email as an MSA
still provides some ease
of administration benefits
at the cost of security risk.
The Visual Studio
Subscriptions admin portal
will recognize all of your users
and be able to track the
status of their email accounts.
This is helpful because
the system will identify
when a person's account
is deactivated in Azure AD
and remove access to the subscription.
However, the subscription
will still be listed
in the portal until it
is removed by the admin.
If you delete the user out of Azure AD
instead of just deactivating them,
then the Visual Studio subscription
will be automatically
removed within 30 days.
This makes subscription management easier
since there are fewer
steps that an admin needs
to take to remove unauthorized access.
If you're already on a managed tenant,
make sure your users are
not using consumer domains
like Hotmail or Outlook
by looking at their sign-in email address
and changing them to their work accounts.

hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in this video we'll look
at some of the key differences between
angular and angularjs
now if you haven't watched our videos on
angular go check them out i'll link it
in the description box below now angular
and angularjs are used interchangeably
but they're not the same
so to learn about the differences
continue watching the video
oh but wait before we begin if you

already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update now here's what we're going to
be learning
first we'll look at what exactly angular
is
then we'll understand what angularjs is
finally we'll differentiate the two
based on architecture
language
expression syntax
dependency injection
routing and speed
so let's
begin now what exactly is angular
angular is an open source javascript
framework written completely in
typescript and maintained by google
now angular provides a standard
structure for developers to work with
it enables users to develop large
applications in a maintainable manner
so what exactly is angularjs then
now angularjs was initially developed by
misco hevery in 2009
it was built to ease the development and
testing of applications it was developed
to address challenges faced in forming
single page applications
now although subsequent versions of
angularjs are what are collectively
called angular they have some
differences so let's go ahead and look
at them
first up is architecture
now angularjs supports a model view
controller architecture
the view processes the information
available in the model to generate the
output
in case of angular it uses components
and directives now components are the
directives with a template
next we have languages
now angularjs was written in javascript
while angular is written in typescript
now typescript offers features like type
declarations and benefits of es6 like
iterators and lambdas the next
difference is with respect to mobile
support
now angularjs was not built with mobile
support in mind
whereas in case of angular this feature
is supported
moving on is expression syntax
now to bind an image or a property or an
event with angularjs you have to
remember the right ng directive
in case of angular it focuses on the
parenthesis for event binding and the
square brackets for property binding
talking about dependency injection
angularjs does not use dependency
injection while angular implements
unidirectional tree based change
detection
and uses the hierarchical dependency
injection system
this significantly boosts the
performance of the framework
next up is routing
now angularjs uses the route
provider.when
method to configure routing while
angular uses the route config object
lastly we have speed by providing
features like two-way binding angularjs
reduce the development effort and time
however by creating more processing on
the client side page load was taking
considerable time
while in case of angular
it provides a better structure to more
easily create and maintain big
applications and a better change
detection mechanism
now angular 4 is the fastest version yet
so with that we come to the end of this
session
these were some of the key differences
between angular and angularjs if you
have any doubts or queries regarding

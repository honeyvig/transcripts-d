hello everyone
i welcome you all to simply learn
bias and variance are important part of
statistical analysis
and is used in several places such as
research machine learning data science
data analytics and many more
it has a wide range of applications
so in this video we will discuss what is
bias and variance and will try to
understand it with the help of an
examples
so without further delay let's move
ahead
what is biases statistics
biases statistics is a term that is used
to refer any type of error that we may
find when you use the statistical
analysis
we can say that it is an estimator of a
parameter that may not be confusing with
its degree of precision
the reasons for this bias may be that
the method by which the data is
collected may be faulty
or the way the question is phrased maybe
not accurate
let's see what are the types of biases
the first one is the measurement bias
batch refers to any systematic or
non-random error type that occurs in the
collection of data in a study
another term that is used for this type
of bias is the detection bias
this difference in observation might be
because of unseen reasons some of them
can be the error that happens while
recording the data or the leading
questions that follows after the data
the error can also occur because the
respondents gave the false answers
suppose you conduct a survey to
determine whether or not someone voted
for president obama
some may have voted for him but the way
the question was put confused the
respondents and they answered wrong
in this case the measurement bias can
occur
the next type of bash is the selection
bias
when you choose your sample or data
incorrectly selection bias occurs there
can be many reasons for this but the
most common reason is when the people
try to work with the data that are
easily available
and because of that the respondents gave
the first response
let's try to understand this concept
with the help of an example
suppose you are conducting a poll to
determine how people feel about the
current ruling government
you have gathered all the information
that you need unfortunately many of them
say that twitter is the primary source
for the information
now social media is not considered
trustworthy because it is in public
opinion but their friend's opinion as a
result
this type of data can be classified as a
traditional selection bias easily
accessible but not for unrepresentative
and specific subsets of the overall
population
the next type of bias is the
self-selection bias
self-selection bias occurs
when the respondents are allowed to
decide entirely for themselves whether
they want to participate in the survey
or not
the reasons for this error may be same
that the data may be collected
which are easily available
let's try to understand this type of
bias with the help of an example
suppose you want to assess a program for
improving the eating habits of the shift
workers
you put a posters where many workers
night shifts and invite them to
participate
however
those who sign up may be different from
those who don't they may be more health
conscious to be with which is why they
are interested in a program to improving
eating habits
if this was the case it wouldn't be fair
to conclude that the program was
effective or not
in this case a selection bias occurs
recall bias
recall bias occurs when respondents
recollection of events is inaccurate or
incomplete
it's specially problematic when it comes
to retrospective service question for
example suppose you're asked for a
football match that happened three years
back
now
you may remember the goals and the
good moments of the football match and
but might not be able to recall the bad
moments or the follows all the mistakes
that happen in that match
so if you try to guess work here in this
case i recall bias can occur
another one is the observer bias
when a researcher subconsciously project
their expectation onto the research this
is known as the observer bias
in this case the beliefs or expectation
of an observer can influence the data
that is collected for the study
let's try to understand this observer
bias with the help of an example
suppose there's a certain news channel
now in the race of trp certain news
might not be accurate or maybe even
false but to prove his point he may try
to prove that this news is correct and
the data that are given are accurate in
this case the observer which is the news
channel is trying to force its opinion
on the data and in this case the
observed bias can occur
so with this we have discussed all the
types of biases with the help of an
example

so what is statistics
statistics is the science concerned with
developing and studying methods for
collecting analyzing and interpreting
the empirical data
statistics the highly interdisciplinary
field research and statistics find
applicability in virtually all
scientific fields and research questions
in the various scientific fields
in developing methods and studying the
theory that analyze the methods
statisticians draw on variety of
mathematical and computational tools
now let's discuss about some of the
important terms related to statistics
the first one is mean
the mean or the average is the most
popular and well-known measure of
central tendency
it can be used with both discrete and
continuous data although use is most
often with the continuous data
it is the average of all the set of
values that are considered
to understand better let's take an
example
suppose we have a class
whose student have obtained the
following marks out of 15 mathematics
here are the following marks
so to find the mean of this marks
we'll add all the marks and divide by
the number of marks there are so we have
the total of 12 marks so the mean of
this number are 22.8
the next term we are going to discuss is
median
the median is the middle score for all
the set of data that had been arranged
in order of magnitude
the median is less affected by the
outliers and skewed data
in order to calculate the median suppose
we have the following data below
so these are the marks that we took in
the previous example
we'll first arrange these marks in the
ascending order
so
to find the median we'll find the middle
point of the two middle terms in the
given data
so here the two main terms are the sixth
and the seventh term which is 32 and 35
so adding the 32 and 35 and dividing it
by 2 will get 3.5
so what can the median tell you
the median provides a helpful measure on
the center of the data set
by comparing the median of the mean you
can get an idea of the distribution of
the data set
when the mean and the media are the same
the data set is more or less evenly
distributed from the lowest to highest
values
the next term is mode
the mode is the most frequent score in
our data set
so suppose we have this following
example
here you can see the mark 70 is
occurring three times so this is our
mode
now that we have discussed
all the terms related to statistics
let's move on to standard deviation
so what is the standard deviation
in statistics a standard division is a
statistics that measures the dispersion
of a data set relative to its mean
the standard deviation is calculated as
the square root of variance by
determining each data points deviation
relative to the mean
if the data is close together standard
division will be small
and if the data is spread and the
standard deviation will be large
let's understand this points with the
help of a bell curve
a bulker's width is defined by standard
deviation which is calculated as the
level of variation of the data in a
sample around the mean
one standard deviation away from the
mean in either direction on the
horizontal axis accounts for some around
68.8 percent of the people in this group
suppose
34.1 on the left side and a 34.1 on the
right side
moving to standard deviation away from
the mean should include 95 percent of
the total data
moving three standard deviations away
from the mean should represents 99.7
percent of the total data while
interpreting a bell curve the points
nearest to the center of the bell curve
are those which are most likely to occur
whereas the point closest to the left
and right edges are the outliers
bulkers are used across the wide variety
of disciplines including finance and
economics social science and natural
science
standard deviation is often denoted by
the greek letter word sigma so now that
we know what is the standard deviation
let's see how we can calculate the
standard deviation
so to calculate the standard deviation
we have this formula
it is the under root of x minus x bar
whole square divided by n minus 1 where
x is the value in the data set x bar is
the mean of the data set and n is the
number of data points in the data
now let's understand the significance of
standard deviation
to get the insights on a large data set
you need the standard deviation
suppose you are owner of a car company
where you manufacture the car parts
and you want to keep check on the
accuracy of the diameter of the car
parts that are being manufactured in
your company
standard division can be very helpful in
this
you can calculate the deviation from the
mean of the car parts that are being
manufactured
the second example you can think of is
the spread of the data such as in case
of house price or the average income
levels in the u.s mortgage through the
standard deviation
now this is all about the theoretical
aspect of the standard division
now let's learn how you can calculate
the standard deviation
to calculate the standard deviation we
have taken this example
this is the marks of
six students out of hundred 73 11 49 35
15 and 27
now the first step is to find the mean
of the given data
so to find the mean as we have learned
in the previous slide you just have to
add all the marks and divide by the
total number of data so here the mean is
35
now the second step will be to calculate
the square of the difference between
each score and the mean
so
we got the mean as our 35 and we'll
subtract the marks with the mean
when we divide 35 from 173 we'll get the
answer of 38 and squaring the 38 we'll
get the answer as one triple four in the
similar manner we have calculated the
mass minus mean whole square for all the
cases you get 576 195 0 464.
now that we have all the data we just
need to put the data in our formula so
the formula was under root max minus
mean whole square divided by total
observations minus 1
here
the marks minus mean whole square will
add all the
data and divided by the total
observations that are 6 minus 1
so this is the standard deviation we get
as a 23.15
now you might be wondering
why we have calculated the standard
deviation what is the use of the
standard deviation
so the standard deviation of 23.5 if we
find that the performance of the
students are not on the same level they
are deviating all over the place now
that we have learned about the standard
deviation and have seen how to calculate
the standard deviation by taking an
example
let's move further
and learn about variance
so what is the variance
you can say various square of the
standard deviation
it is a statistical concept whose
purpose is to measure the dispersion of
observation around the mean or the
average value
variance tells the degree of spread in
your data set thus more spread the data
the larger the variance is in the
relation to the means and you can see
with the graph
our central line is mu is the mean and
on the either side of the
v you can see the spread of the data
the major difference between the
standard deviation and the variance is
that strange integration is expressed in
the same units as the original values
suppose exact meters
variance is expressed in much larger
units example meter squared
since the unit of variance are much
larger than those of a typical value of
a data set it's harder to interpret the
variance number
accurately that's why standard deviation
is often preferred as the main measure
of variability
so to calculate the formula we just have
to square the formula that we have seen
in the standard deviation
so the formula of the variance is sigma
x minus x bar whole square divided by n
minus 1
where x is the value in the data set x
bar is the mean of the data set and n is
the number of data points in the data
let's see some example where variance is
used in the real life
in a real life situation managers can
take suitable actions to achieve the
desired objectives if there is a
variation analysis of the actual
performance you can compare the
variation of the performance in the
different quarter
against the mean of the performance of
all the employees
the second example you can think of is
the analysis of the performance of the
different organization
so how to calculate the variance so this
is the same previous example we have the
marks of student out of hundred
so the first step would be to find the
mean of the given data
so as calculated before the mean of the
given data was 35
step two will be to calculate the square
of the difference between each score and
the mean
so this is the same as the previous step
where we have calculated the
mass minus mean whole square
the change come here the variance
formula is
the square of the max minus mean whole
square divided by observation minus n
so when we add all the mass minus mean
whole square and divided by 5 we will
get the variances 536
majorly variance is used to calculate
the standard deviation since it is a
square root when we calculate the square
root of 536 we'll get the answer that's
23.5 it is same as the standard
deviation so you must be thinking why
does variance matter
so variance matters for two main reasons
first the parametric statistical tests
are sensitive to variance comparing the
variance of sample helps you to assess
the group differences

Thank you, Chairman Graham,
Ranking Member Whitehouse,
Senator Hatch, it's my pleasure
to be here
on behalf of Microsoft
this afternoon.
Certainly, before I say
anything else,
I want to echo your thoughts,
and the views of so many
Americans, in expressing our
condolences and our concerns to
Mr. McGuinness and all of the
people of the United Kingdom.
Today's hearing gives us an
opportunity to address related
issues, the important need for
law enforcement to work across
borders to obtain information
it needs,
while avoiding conflicts with
other countries laws.
The issue is not new,
governments have long turned to
Mutual Legal Assistance
Treaties,
or MLATs, but the world has
clearly changed.
As a company responsible for
storing and safeguarding
citizens' most private
information in the cloud,
we long recognized that new laws
are needed.
I first want to underscore
Microsoft's appreciation for
last year's work to negotiate a
bilateral agreement between the
United States and the
United Kingdom.
This agreement is a positive
step forward which we support.
Second, I want to thank the
Department of Justice for
proposing a new
framework for U.S. law.
While we have important concerns
with some aspects of this
proposal, we have long urged the
department to consider new
legislation, and this is a
welcomed step.
Since Microsoft filed this
lawsuit in 2013,
we've stated repeatedly that new
law is needed.
We recognize that criminals
sometimes use technology across
borders, and that MLATs and
legal principles designed for
the 20th century simply have not
kept pace.
Unfortunately, while the use of
extraterritorial search warrants
in the short run have sometimes
helped law enforcement,
they have created their own set
of problems.
First, they've led the conflicts
between laws,
even among friends and allies,
as countries seek to protect the
privacy of their citizens.
These conflicts put technology
companies in impossible position
of deciding whose law they
will break.
Second, the use of
extraterritorial warrants
undermines foreign confidence in
American technology.
They drive foreign customers to
foreign products and put
American jobs at risks.
These concerns led to
our lawsuit,
objecting to extraterritorial
search warrants to obtain
information stored in our data
center in Ireland.
Last year's court of
appeals decision,
supporting Microsoft's position,
makes clear that now is the time
for congress to act.
While important details remain,
the DOJ's proposal opens the
door to a new and constructive
discussion.
Importantly, the department
proposes a new legal framework
that would enable companies that
have information in the United
States responsive to a foreign
warrant to turn that information
over directly to a foreign
government in specific,
appropriate circumstances.
It would do so in a way that
both complies with foreign and
U.S law, and in a manner, that
protects privacy
and civil liberties.
Ultimately, we have one
fundamental concern with the
DOJ's proposal, a concern that
can be addressed readily.
The DOJ proposes a new standard
for allied and friendly
governments to obtain
information located in the
United States in a manner that
respects U.S law,
namely through this new
framework,
but the DOJ would not follow
that framework itself.
Instead, it wants to revert to
extraterritorial search warrants
despite all the problems
these create.
Put simply, this isn't going
to work.
One year from tomorrow, on
May 25, 2018,
the European General Data
Protection Regulation
will take effect.
On that day, technology
companies that comply with the
DOJ'S proposed extraterritorial
warrants for information stored
in Europe are almost certain to
violate European law.
In fact, they will be subject to
a fine of up to four percent of
worldwide revenue.
Instead the U.S. needs to
consider the same framework for
itself, and demonstrate respect
for borders and reciprocity with
allied and friendly nations.
This isn't simple, but
it's achievable.
We have a year and a day to
solve this.
We'll need important work by
the subcommittee,
it will need to build on the
DOJ proposal,
and it will need to build on the
sustained work of
senators Hatch and Coons.
It will also require a
broad dialogue.
Speaking for myself, and
considering my colleagues across
the tech sector, I believe we're
willing and able to help.
Thank you.

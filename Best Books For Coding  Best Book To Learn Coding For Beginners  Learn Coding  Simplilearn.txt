hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
discuss the top coding books but before
we begin make sure that you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit that bell icon to
never miss an update from simply learn
if you're a coder then you should be a
good reader it helps you enhance your
coding skills based on the current
trends before getting started with code
a coder should understand the
requirements the right books will help
you enrich your programming and
debugging skills so we bring you a list
of books each with a different
perspective that will help you gain an
overall expertise in the field of coding
so without further ado let's get started
with our first coding book in this
session
so the first book in our docket is
automate the boring stuff with python
this book was written by a great author
mrs wagat and published in the year
2015. swagat is a software developer and
also a passionate tech author he loves
to develop codes in python so he used
python language in this book in this
book you will learn how to use python
for writing programs which is mainly for
beginner level programmers
it will help you in learning and
creating programs using python this
helps you to get the knowledge on
automating the keyboard and mouse and
web scraping this book also helps in
split merging encryption of pdfs now why
should you go for it
the author of this book mentioned a
step-by-step explanation for each and
every program that makes learning curve
linear and you can get started with your
coding like icing on the top of cake
this book is completely for beginners so
no hardcore coding knowledge is required
and also to advance to the next level
this book helps you with some practice
programs there are practice questions at
the end of each chapter to get more
ideas about python and improve the
programming skills
these are the few reasons to make you
choose this book for learning to code
next in the docket is clean code
a handbook of agile and craftsmanship
this book was written by a great author
robert martin this book will help you
plot that next breakthrough to become a
professional programmer this book was
published in the year 2008 and it is
suitable for software developers team
lead project managers to produce better
code
this book is divided into three parts
the first part describes the principles
patterns and writing clean code the
second part describes several case
studies with exercises the third part
will walk you through a single chapter
containing a list of heuristics
this book gives an idea for coders to
know all the minute and delicate
differences between a good and a bad
code this book also improves the state
of craftsmanship and fixing the bugs in
the code
why should one go for it
the author robert martin used proper
code and neat explanations for each and
every code to make it easy for everyone
to understand how quotes are written
robert also explained how to transform
and create names classes functions and
error handling
challenges are provided at the end of
every chapter to make it easy for every
reader to implement codes in real time
if you're interested in producing better
code this book is the best choice for
you
moving up to the next book we have
programming pearls
programming pearls was written by joe
bentley the programming pulse offers
unique solutions to nagging problems
this book was published in the year 1986
this book offers solid techniques and
solutions to computer programs
in this book bentley mainly focused on
three essays
testing bugging and timing
set representation string problems this
book is covered with practical problems
and effective solutions
the main highlight of this book is
delightful reading and the writing style
is simply outstanding
now why should you go for it
in this book bentley mainly focused on
hardcore coding problems to deliver
workable solutions for the coders and
programmers
it challenges the outstanding concepts
of cpu memory and algorithms
bentley focuses on principles and key
techniques for easy understanding for
the readers the next book in the session
is the clean coder
a coder of conduct for professional
programmers much more than the rules and
guidelines which was written by the
author robert martin is published in the
year 2011.
this book covers tools and techniques
for true software craftsmanship the key
factor of this book is practical advice
on refactoring and testing
now why should one go for it through
this book martin shows how to approach
software development with honor
self-respect and pride
and also this book demonstrates avoiding
common pitfalls in software development
now moving forward the next book of the
session is code complete a practical
handbook of software construction this
book was written by steve mcconnell and
published in the year 1993
he is the author of multiple software
engineering books and an expert in
software development and project
management
it is fully loaded with integration
architecture
testing and
leading edge coding concepts of software
development
now why should one go for this book this
book is a massive piece of literature
packed with techniques and suggestions
to improve everyday programming
steve covered this book with big
projects to make it easy for everyone to
improve coding skills
now the next book in the list is the rf
computer programming which is written by
the author donald nutt this book was
published in the year 1968 with four
volumes it is a computer monograph that
covers many kinds of programming
algorithms and their analysis
this book mainly covers and represents
the inside concepts of a computer the
key concepts of this book are
programming algorithms fundamental
algorithms sorting and searching
now why should one go for this book this
book mainly covers the chief technical
aspects of the algorithms and their
analysis
every chapter of this book is explained
with clean code and flowcharts that is
easy for every reader to understand
now the next book in the session is zero
bucks and program faster which was
written by the author kate thompson
kate thompson is also known for being
the best writers of the children's

research and find out the techniques of
bug avoidance this book was published in
august 2015. this book gives an idea of
improving skills and avoiding mistakes
and coding in this book kate mainly
concentrated on bug avoidance techniques
and implementing the secure code
improving skills and principles to avoid
bugs
now why should one go for this book this
book helps to write code in a secure way
that improves the security of the code
and it helps to improve the coding time
by reducing the effort with fewer bucks

algorithms it represents many algorithms
and covers them in considerable depth
and makes their design and analysis
accessible to all levels of readers some
of the key features of this book are
pseudo code arithmetic algorithms and
arithmetic circuits
now why should one go for this book
each chapter of this book presents an
algorithm a design technique and an
application area or a related topic
algorithms are described in english and
in a pseudocode designed to be readable
by anyone who has done a little
programming
this book also covers the depth of
greedy algorithms and mathematical rigor
the next book in the list is rapid
development taming wild software
schedules this book is written by steve
mcconnell
this book was published in the year 1996
and this book helps in improving the
development speed of rapid development
and risk management and also prototyping
now why should one go for this book this
book is completely designed with an
overview of their projects and their
directions
which helps in avoiding the mystics for
rapid development including creeping
requirements short-changed quality and
cellular bullet syndrome
moving forward
the final book of this session is

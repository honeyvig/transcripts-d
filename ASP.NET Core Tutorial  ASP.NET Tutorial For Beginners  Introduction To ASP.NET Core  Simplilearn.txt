hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will learn
about asp.net core tutorial if you are
interested in building web application
and wondering which framework to use
then don't worry you're in the right
place
this video will help you explain about
asp.net core and guide you through it
let us look what's in it for you in this
session
we shall begin with understanding what
is asp.net core
and then see why to use asp.net core
followed by which we will look at some
of the features of asp.net core then we
will understand different layers of
architecture present in asp.net core
proceeding further we will see some of
the key benefits of asp.net core
over.net framework
then we will look at the industry trends
of asp.net core
finally we have a demo wherein we will
create and run an asp.net code but
before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell like so you never
miss an update from simply learn
watch the video till the end so that you
don't miss on the demo
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
what is asp.net core
asp.net core is an open source
cross-platform high performance
framework for developing modern
cloud-enabled internet-connected apps
asp.net core is the open source version
of asp.net that runs on mac os linux and
windows
asp.net core was first released in 2016
and is a redesign of earlier windows
only versions of asp.net
why use asp.net core
asp.net is used by millions of
developers to construct web applications
asp.net core is a redesigned version of
asp.net that includes architectural
improvements to create a more modular
framework
with asp.net core we can
build web apps and services iot apps and
mobile
we can use development tools on windows
mac os and linux
using asp.net core we can deploy to the
cloud or on-premises
we can run on.net core
now let us look at the features of
asp.net code
esp.net core provides a single framework
for developing web ui and web apis
asp.net core is designed for testing
it provides laser pages that make it
easier and more productive to code page
focus situations
blazer allows use of c sharp alongside
javascript in the browser
share server side and client-side
application logic built-in.net
asp.net core has the capability to
design and run applications on windows
mac os and linux
it is community driven and open source
it provides modern client-side
frameworks and development methods that
are integrated
asp.net is a configuration system that
is cloud ready and environment based
it gives high performance lightweight
modular http request pipeline and
provides built-in dependency injection
asp.net core has the capability to host
on the following platforms that is
kestrel
http
nginx and apache docker
now let us look at the architecture of
asp.net
the concept of asp.net fundamental
architecture is similar to n-layer
architecture
that defines the layer as the core
component of the platform releasing the
developer the burden of redefining it in
order to make solution more flexible and
reusable
the main business logic and ui logic in
asp.net core are encapsulated in the web
app layer while the database access
layer cache services and web api
services are encapsulated in the
infrastructure layer
common utilities objects interfaces and
reusable business services are
encapsulated as micro services in the
application core project the data
sources could be sql database
and the third-party services include
github api send grid api and others
dotted arrow shows the compile time
dependency and the regular arrow
indicates the runtime dependency
application core project
the business model which contains
entities services and interfaces is
stored in the application code
these interfaces contains abstractions
for operations done by infrastructure
such as database access file system
access and network calls and so on
application code types include entities
interfaces services and dtos
infrastructure project
the infrastructure project includes data
access implementations such as entity
framework ef core migration objects and
data access implementation classes
the infrastructure project contains
implementation of services that must
interact with the infrastructure
concerns
these services implement interfaces
defined in the application code and so
infrastructure should have a reference
to the application core project
infrastructure types include af core
types data access implementation types
and infrastructure specific services
benefits of asp.net core over asp.net
framework
benefits of.net core over.net framework
include
it provides cross-platform it runs on
windows mac os and linux
asp.net core has improved performance
it provides side by side versioning
it provides new apis
and it is open source
now let us look at the industry trends
of asp.net core
this picture depicts the industry trends
of asp.net and dotnet framework
asp.net core is the most used framework
and it is growing in popularity as the
majority of developers use it on regular
basis
it is expected that asp.net will
overtake dot net framework in popularity
in coming years

the battle what if you could do that for

so now let us look at the demo
so we'll first look at the prerequisites
first we need to install the required
software and set up the system for
asp.net code development first we need a
editor maybe visual studio sublime
autumn or any other but i would
recommend to go with visual studio 2019
next we need dot net core sdk software
development kit
so let's go to the browser and install
this
so go to the visual studio.microsoft.com
and go to downloads from here you can
download visual studio 2019
the community edition this is free free
community edition
then to download.net sdk
go to
dotnetmicrosoft.com from here you can
download.net core
from here you can download.net core 3.1
so click on this and get this download
once you have downloaded these files
open visual studio code
open visual studio 29
so open visual studio 2019 when you open
it for the first time in the workloads
under the tool set section select.net
core cross platform
on the left hand side it shows the
recent project that you have worked on
and at the right hand side we can create
a new project we can open a folder open
a project or a solution and clone the
repository
so we'll click on create new project
so these are the different project
templates
present in visual studio 2019
we have asp.net core web app this is
used for creating core application
for example laser pages content and we
have blazer web assembly and then we
have asp.net core empty in this tablet
we can create.net core application from
the scratch
and we have asp.net core web app model v
controller we will discuss this in the
upcoming videos similarly we have laser
server app asp.net core web api and many
more
then scroll down and explore we have
many more we have asp.net core with
angular with react.js
so for now we will use asp.net core
empty
so select this asp.net core empty and
click on next
and name the project so we'll name the
project as
demo application
if you want to provide a different
solution name you can check this box and
provide a different solution name
so click on next
select the target framework
dot net core 3.1 or 5.0 i'll select it
as 5.0
and click on next
click on create
so here we go the demo app project is
created
these are the default folders that are
generated
we have dependencies folder
in which we have analyzers and
frameworks then we have properties
folder
in which we have launchsetting.json file
then we have appsettings.json file and
we have program and startup file
so we'll run this
and see click on run
and here you can see build started
here we can see
to localhost
44313
so it's showing hello world
so where is this hello world getting
generated from
so go back to visual studio
so go to solution explorer
and go to startup.cs file
if you scroll down
you can see here
this is where hello world is getting
generated from
so we'll change this
change the message and enter
so change the message and enter thanks
for watching stay tuned to simply
so let me run this
and here you see
so here you can see thanks for watching
and stay tuned to see later
so with that we have reached the end of
this video like and share it if you
found it interesting thank you for being
here
so in the upcoming videos we'll be
creating web apps and we'll be using
mvc model view controller so stay tuned
to simply learn and keep learning thank
you

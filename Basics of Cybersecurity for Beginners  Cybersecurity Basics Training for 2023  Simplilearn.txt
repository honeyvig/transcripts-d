exciting Journey as we Empower you with
the knowledge and and skills to navigate
the ever evolving digital landscape with
confidence let's dive into the
fascinating world of cyber security meet
an she often shops from www.
shoppingcart tocom she has her
information like email ID address and
credit card details saved on the website
to enable a faster and hassle-free
shopping
experience the required information is
stored in a server one day Anne received
an email which stated her eligibility
for a special discount voucher from
shopping cart.com in order to receive
the coupon code she was asked to fill in
her shopping cart.com account
credentials this didn't seem fishy to
her at the time as she thought it was
just an account verification step little
did she realize the danger she would be
facing she was knocked off her feet when
a substantial amount of money was wiped
off her account how do you think this
happened well yes the email she received
was fake and shopping cart.com account
witnessed unauthorized access from a
third party this type of attack is known
as a Cyber attack and the person who
carries it out is called a hacker could
an have prevented this attack indeed she
could have with the help of cyber
security cyber security involves
techniques that help in securing various
digital components networks data and
computer systems from unauthorized
digital access there are multiple ways
to implement cyber security depending on
the kind of network you are connected to
and the type of cyber attacks you are
prone to so let's take a look at the
various cyber attacks that Anne could
have been exposed to one of the most
common types of cyber attacks is a
malware attack like Trojan adwar and
spyware to name a few had Anne
downloaded any suspicious attachments
online her system could have gotten
corrupted by certain malicious viruses
embedded within the attachments
next is a fishing attack the type of
Cyber attack which an experienced here
the hacker usually sends fraudulent
emails which appear to be coming from a
legitimate Source this is done to
install malware or to steal sensitive
data like credit card information and
login
credentials another type of attack is
the man in the middle attack here the
hacker gains access to the information
path between Ann's device and the
website server the Hacker's computer
takes over an IP address by doing so the
communication line between an and the
website is secretly intercepted this
commonly happens with unsecured Wi-Fi
networks and also through malware
password attack is one of the easiest
ways to hack a system here Ann's
password could have been cracked by
using either common passwords or trying
all possible alphabetical combinations
to prevent future cyber attacks Ann
sought to implement a few cyber security
practices first first she installed a
firewall as the name suggests it is a
virtual wall between Ann's computer and
the internet firewalls filter the
incoming and outgoing traffic from your
device to safeguard your network and
they can either be software applications
or Hardware
reinforcements secondly an implemented
honey pots just like how flowers attract
bees dummy computer systems called honey
Poots are used to attract attackers
these systems are made to look
vulnerable in order to deceive a
attackers and this in turn defends the
real system in addition to these she
also decided to use unique alpha numeric
passwords antivirus software and started
avoiding mailes from unknown senders
that was Ann's story cyber attacks are
not just confined to individuals but
also to public and private organizations
the cyber attacks carried out in such
places are more deadly and they result
in colossal losses motives of such
attacks are many starting from tampering
with crucial data to monetary gains
let's have a look at a few of the cyber
attacks that companies are subjected to
various public sector organizations and
large corporations face the advanced
persistent threat a in this form of
attack hackers gain access to networks
for a prolonged period in order to
continuously gain confidential
information companies also witnessed the
denial of service attack where networks
are flooded with traffic which in turn
leaves legitimate service requests
unattended a variant of this is the
distributed denial of service DDOS
attack when multiple systems are used to
launch the attack when a hacker
manipulates a standard SQL query in a
database driven website it is known as a
SQL injection attack by doing so hackers
can view edit and delete tables from
databases amidst a plethora of cyber
attacks it is indeed a challenge for
organizations with several Network and
servers to ensure complete Security this
is not an easy task and to help with
this cyber Security Professionals are
hired to work on identifying cyber
threats and securing a company's Network
there are multiple job roles in the
field of cyber security if hacking
fascinates you then the role of an
ethical hacker is something to be
explored such professionals try to exp
Network's vulnerabilities just like how
a hacker would do but only to identify
those vulnerabilities and resolve them
for protection against an actual Cyber
attack but if you are looking to design
robust security structures then the role
of a security architect is more apt a
chief information security officer ciso
plays a crucial role in Enterprise
security and is entrusted with the
overall safety of the information in an
organization now there are several
reasons as to why you should learn cyber
security here we have the top 10 reasons
for the same at number 10 the reason we
have is basic requirements there is a
wrong notion that building a career in
cyber security is daunting well it is
not a fancy college degree is not at all
that it takes to become a successful
cyber security professional you can
Venture into the domain of cyber
security with some basic knowledge of it
and with an authorized cyber security
certification the overall eligibility
Criterion for the cyber security domain
is relaxing across the world it
professionals with cyber security
certifications are known to receive
higher salary packages certifications
are always given extra weightage in the

professionals so don't take a step back
from learning cyber security thinking it
is a tedious process if you are a
fresher or a professional you can go
ahead with just these basic
requirements before moving on to our
next reason here is a question for you
all how many of you like mathematics
please let us know in the comment
section below I'm sure not everyone
loves mathematics and that is completely
okay when it comes to learning cyber
security and our ninth reason is
mathematics is not a concern for
learning cyber security
many of us find mathematics challenging
some have the aptitude for dealing with
numbers and some don't and for those who
don't they find it difficult to proceed
with a career that has maths
involved however you can take your
decision without any worries when it
comes to cyber security as the domain of
cyber security does not involve
mathematics so if maths is not your
strong point then choosing to learn

networking network security control and
coding to build a career in cyber
security our eighth reason is that cyber
security is a profession that helps
achieve the greater good cyber security
consists of a set of measures and
approaches that help companies and
individuals data from being compromised
and
stolen cyber Security Professionals have
defended organizations from several
deadly cyber attacks that aimed at
jeopardizing ing an organization's
confidentiality integrity and
availability cyber crimes are currently
on the rise with different types of
cyber attacks the threat to
organizations and individuals alike is
only growing by the day government
agencies police forces and cyber crime
cells are tackling this threat however
there is more requirement for skilled
cyber security professionals who can
protect data and work for the greater
good therefore if you want to bring
about a positive impact and a meaningful
difference to the society we live in

Microsoft and GE to name a few with
passion the right amount of experience
and relevant certifications you can grow
your cyber security career you can check
out Simply learn cyber security expert
Masters program to equip you with the
necessary skills needed to become an
expert in this rapidly growing domain
this course will help you learn various
methods as to how you can protect your
infrastructure secure your data run risk
analysis achieve compliance and much
more according to cyber crime magazine
by cyber security Ventures globally
there would be nearly 3.5 million
unfilled cyber security jobs by 2021 and
the number of Internet users will hit a
warping 6 billion by 2022
these numbers speak volumes and this
shows the growing demand for cyber
Security Professionals across the
globe now that you know the high demand
for cyber Security Professionals let us
help you start your cyber security
career by bagging the right skill
set many of you out there might be
waiting to become a cyber security
professional but are unsure of how to go
about it and what skills you would need
to get a cyber security job not to worry
we are here to help you with that after
extensive research we have come up with
the top five skills that will help you
get into the field of cyber security
let's have a look at these skills
individually first we have networking
and system administration the number one
skill you need to have to enter the
field of cyber security is computer
networking networking is the backbone of
the internet it is imperative that you
have an in-depth understanding of
networking to start a career in cyber
security
a network is a group of interconnected
devices and networking is the art of
understanding how data is sent
transmitted and received amongst these
devices you need to know various routing
protocols the tcpip and OSI models
govern networking The OSI model is
comparatively newer basically in these
models all the protocols are grouped
into layers and work together to help
you receive data on your device sent
from a server learning networking will
help you understand the tech technical
aspects of data transmission which will
help you secure your data you can take
up networking certifications like
Security Plus and Cisco CCNA to gain a
strong networking
Foundation another skill that be
beneficial for you is to Master System
Administration if you think about it all
of us are CIS admins at some
level system administration is all about
configuring and maintaining computers
you must be curious to know every aspect
of your computer features and settings
and play around a bit carry out a trial
and error method and give yourself small
tasks like recovering deleted files or
monitoring old viruses on a VM explore
new techniques put them into use and
expand your
knowledge let us now move on to our
second skill knowledge of operating
systems and virtual
machines to become a cyber security
professional you need to have a strong
knowledge of operating environments such
as Windows Linux and Mac OS cyber
Security Professionals largely use Linux
and it comes with several tools to learn
operating systems go ahead and set up
and use Virtual machines that is VMS and
play around with them this will help you
gain hands-on experience as a cyber
security expert you should be
comfortable working on any OS WMS allow
you to train and research in an isolated
environment and help you maximize your
skills the next point to remember is to
know Kali Linux it is the most widely
known Linux distribution for ethical
hacking and penetration
testing it comes with several hundred
tools related to penetration testing
malware analysis security research
computer forensics and so on Kali
contains several projects and you can
learn a lot another good thing about
Cali is that it is free to use so what
are you waiting for download and start
right away remember that Linux is the
backbone of cyber security and a
commonly asked topic for cyber security
interviews especially for pentesting
roles
moving on to our third skill our third
skill is network security control it is
another basic skill that every cyber
security professional should have
network security control refers to the
different measures which are employed to
enhance the security of a network it is
simple you can only Safeguard your
network if you know how it works how
routers firewalls and other devices work
a firewall is a hardware or software
that blocks incoming or outgoing traffic
from the internet to your
computer firewalls are required to
secure a network as a cyber security
expert you must be able to leverage a
firewall to filter and prevent
unauthorized traffic onto the network in
addition to that as a cyber security
expert you must know about intrusion
detection systems intrusion prevention
systems virtual private networks and
remote
access an intrusion detection system IDs
is designed to detect unauthorized
access to a system it is used together
with a firewall and a router you should
be able to operate the IDS and recognize
any security policy violations and
malicious traffic on the
network as many of you may have used a
VPN is a connection between a VPN server
and a VPN client it is a secure tunnel
across the
internet moving on next up we have an
interesting skill any idea what that is
if yes pause and leave a comment as to
what you think that next skill will be
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more and before we jump into this skill
if you find this video interesting make
sure to give it a thumbs up fourth skill
on our list is
coding so you might be wondering if
coding is really required to become a
cyber security professional well it is
true that not all cyber security
professionals have or need coding
skills however having zero coding
knowledge May limit your opportunities
in the future knowing a couple of
programming languages will help you
identify the plan behind an attack and
defend against deadly hacking
techniques so as seen on your screens
these are the best programming languages
to learn to make your cyber security
career
worthwhile we have C and C++ the C
programming language is the backbone of
most operating systems
C and C++ are low-level programming
languages that you need to know as a
cyber security professional on the other
hand python is a highlevel programming
language that is becoming popular among
cyber Security Experts today knowing
python will give you an upper hand in
your career it will help you identify
and fix
vulnerabilities JavaScript is another
highlevel programming language that adds
interactivity to web pages a good
advantage of knowing JavaScript is that
you can prevent cross-site scripting
attacks from occurring as in these
attacks the attacker implants malicious
code in a web application speaking of
PHP because most of the websites are
created using PHP learning it will help
you defend against
Intruders similarly HTML is another
language cyber Security Professionals
should understand as most websites use
it and it is one of the easiest
languages to learn another programming
language that you can use is goang it is
great for cryptography you can solve
various cyber security problems with it
then we have SQL that is structured
query language attackers use this
language to damage the store data one
such example is the SQL injection attack
hence having a good understanding of SQL
will be highly beneficial another Point
we'd like to highlight is to have
knowledge of Assembly Language this will
help you become a cyber security
engineer assembly will help you
understand how malware functions and
thereby help you defend against it in
the cyber security domain you can't just
lock into a single language and hence it
is advised that you're acquainted with a
couple of them you can also do a crash
course for these languages and learn
them hence determine the best
programming language for your cyber
security role and get familiar with the
basics moving on our fifth skill on the
list is cloud security there is a
growing demand for cyber Security
Professionals with Cloud security skills
in the coming
years companies are on the lookout for
professionals with security skills
applicable to public and hybrid Cloud
platforms such as Amazon web services
and Azure more organizations look to
Cloud infrastructure to store data and
run
applications this includes the
implementation of policies and
technologies that protect cloud-based
systems and
devices just like application
development security Cloud security also
involves building secure systems from
the start companies want professionals
who can manage the cloud security tools
to identify and prevent any Cloud
breaches people with experience and
knowledge in managing big platforms such
as Microsoft Azure AWS and the gcp are
in high demand now that we have seen the
top five cyber security skills let us go
through a set of additional skills that
can help you get into the cyber security
field remember that to become a
successful cyber security expert you
must possess a rich and diverse skill
set so in a list of additional skills
first we have risk
analysis identifying risks even before
their arrival is a great skill
cyber Security Professionals are
required to identify manage and mitigate
risks risk management and mitigation is
a skill set that is going to be highly
in demand in the coming years next we
have information security companies
require skilled professionals who can
protect their electronic data from
unauthorized taxes here in demand skills
are authentication authorization malware
analysis and data
recovery next on our list is security
incident handling and response
as a cyber security expert you must be
prepared to handle any forthcoming
threat of violating an organization
security policy by following an updated
incident response plan your team can
proactively protect your data and
minimize the
damages in security Incident Management
you are required to identify manage
record and analyze security threats in
real time a security incident can be an
active threat or a successful compromise
of data or an attempted intrusion it can
can also be incidents like dos attacks
fishing APS ransomware and many more
another important pointer is that as a
security practitioner you must also
manage and analyze the security
information and event management S tools
and
services moving on we have security
audit security auditing is an internal
check that is carried out to find flaws
in the organization's information system
you must be able to conduct a review of
the organization's adherence to regular
atory guidelines security audit and
compliance knowledge are very crucial as
any Mysteria of Regulatory Compliance
could lead to Hefty penalties soon
organizations will need people who are
more familiar with the various data
privacy regulations if you are good at
paperwork you can capitalize on this
skill companies will need people who can
understand what paperwork to file and
which security protocols to use to
comply with the
regulations finally we have laws and
regulations and often overlooked cyber
security aspects
there are several cyber security laws
and regulations and if you break these
laws intentionally or not it doesn't
matter as you will still be charged
these laws Define how you can use the
internet and it also defines how people
can be protected from becoming the
victims of cyber crimes knowing these
laws and regulations and following the
best practice will make you ethical at
your job and this will in turn be good
for your organization so those were our
list of additional skills apart from
these make sure you stay updated with
new hacks and learn new tools as cyber
security is ever
evolving another important skill apart
from these technical skills is your soft
skills having a set of good soft skills
will help you bag your dream job we have
a video on the top five soft skills that
will help you grow in your career do
watch that and incorporate those skills
as well we humans are highly techsavvy
in today's times with the extensive use
of the internet and modern Technologies
there is a massive challenge in
protecting all our Digital Data such as
net banking information account
credentials and medical reports to name
a few have you heard about the deadly
one to cry ransomware attack the attack
happened in May 2017 in Asia and then it
spread across the world within a day
more than 230,000 computers were
infected across 150 countries the wry
Crypt worm encrypted the data and locked
the users out of their systems for
decryption of the data the users were
asked for a ransom of $300 to $600 in
Bitcoin the users who used the
unsupported version of Microsoft Windows
and those who hadn't installed the
security update of April 2017 were
targeted in this attack the one a cry
attack took a toll on every sector top
tier organizations like Itachi Nissan
and FedEx had to put their businesses on
hold as their systems were affected too
now this is what you call a Cyber attack
to prevent such attacks cyber security
is implemented we can Define cyber
security as the practice of protecting
networks programs computer systems and
their components from unauthorized
digital attacks these illegal attacks
are often referred to as hacking hacking
refers to exploiting weaknesses in a
computer network to obtain unauthorized
access to information a hacker is a
person who tries to hack into computer
systems this is a misconception that
hacking is always wrong there are
hackers who work with different motives
let's have a look at three different
types of hackers black hat hackers are
individuals who illegally hack into a
system for a monetary gain on the
contrary we have wh hat hackers who
exploit the vulnerabilities in a system
by hacking into it with permission in
order to defend the organization this
form of hacking is absolutely legal and
ethical hence they are also often
referred to as ethical hackers in
addition to these hackers we also have
the gry Hat hackers as the name suggests
the color gray is a blend of both white
and black these hackers discover
vulnerabilities in a system and report
it to the system's owner which is a good
act but they do this without seeking the
owner's approval sometimes gry hat
hackers also ask for money in return for
the spotted
vulnerabilities now that you have seen
the different types of hackers let's
understand more about the hacking that
is legal and valid ethical hacking
hacking through an interesting story Dan
runs a Trading Company he does online
training with the money his customers
invest everything was going well and
Dan's business was booming until a
hacker decided to hack the company's
servers the hacker stole the credentials
of various trading accounts he asked for
a lump some Ransom in exchange for the
stolen credentials Dan took the Hacker's
words lightly and didn't pay the hacker
as a result the hacker withdrew money
from various customers accounts and and
Dan was liable to pay back the customers
Dan lost a lot of money and also the
trust of his customers after this
incident Dan gave a lot of thought as to
what could have gone wrong with the
security infrastructure in his company
he wished there was someone from his
company who could have run a test attack
to see how vulnerable systems were
before the hacker penetrated into the
network this was when he realized he
needed an employee who thinks like a
hacker and identifies the
vulnerabilities in his Network before an
outsider does to do this job he hired an
ethical hacker John John was a skilled
professional who worked precisely like a
hacker in no time he spotted several
vulnerabilities in Dan's organization
and closed all the loopholes hiring an
ethical hacker helped Dan protect his
customers from further attacks in the
future this in turn increased the
company's productivity and guarded the
company's
reputation so now you know hacking is
not not always bad John in this scenario
exposed the vulnerabilities in the
existing Network and such hacking is
known as ethical hacking ethical hacking
is distributed into six different phases
let us look at these phases step by step
with respect to how John our ethical
hacker will act before launching an
attack the first step Jon takes is to
gather all the necessary information
about the organization system that he
intends to attack this step is called
reconnaissance he uses tools like inmap
and hping for this purpose John then
tries to spot the vulnerabilities if any
in the Target system using tools like
inmap and expose this is the scanning
phase now that he has located the
vulnerabilities he then tries to exploit
them this step is known as gaining
access after Jon makes his way through
the organization's networks he tries to
maintain his access for future attacks
by installing back doors in the Target
system the metas sploit tool helps him
with this this phase is called
maintaining access johon is a brilliant
hacker hence he tries his best not to
leave any evidence of his attack this is
the fifth phase clearing tracks we now
have the last phase that is reported in
this phase johon documents a summary of
his entire attack the vulnerabilities he
spotted the tools he used and the
success rate of the attack looking at
into the report Dan is now able to take
a call and see how to protect his
organization from any external cyber
attacks don't you all think Jon is an
asset to any organization if you want to
become an ethical hacker like Jon then
there are a few skills that you need to
acquir first and foremost you need to
have a good knowledge of operating
environments such as Windows Linux Unix
and Macintosh you must have reasonably
good knowledge of programming languages
such as HT ml PHP python SQL and
JavaScript networking is the base of
ethical hacking hence you should be good
at it ethical hackers should be well
aware of security laws so that they
don't misuse their skills finally you
must have a global certification on
ethical hacking to successfully bag a
position of an ethical hacker like John
few examples of ethical hacking
certification are certified ethical
hacker certification C CompTIA pinest
plus and licensed penetration tester
certification to name a few simply learn
provides a cyber security expert
master's program that will equip you
with all the skills required by a cyber
security
expert when it comes to web app hacking
It generally refers to the exploitation
of applications via HTTP which can be
done by manipulating the applications
via its graphical user interface this is
done by tampering with the uniform
resource identifier also also known as a
URI or tampering with the HTTP elements
directly which are not a part of the URI
the hacker can send a link via an email
or a chat and may trick the users of a
web application into executing actions
in case the attack is on an
administrator account the entire web
application can be
compromised anyone who uses a computer
connected to the internet is susceptible
to the threats that computer hackers and
online Predators pose these online vain
typically use fishing scams spam email
or instant messages and bogus websites
to deliver dangerous malware to your
computer and compromise your computer
security computer hackers can also try
to access your computer and private
information directly if you're not
protected by a firewall they can monitor
your conversations or produse the back
end of your personal website usually
disguised with a bogus identity
Predators can lure you into revealing
sensitive personal and financial
information
a web server which can be referred to as
the hardware the computer or the
software which helps to deliver content
that can be accessed through the
internet the primary function of a web
server is to deliver these web pages on
the request to clients using the
hypertext transfer protocol or
HTTP so hackers attack the web server to
steal credential information passwords
and business information by using
different types of attacks like Doos
attacks SN flooding ping flood port scan
and social engineering attacks in the
area of web security despite strong
encryption on the browser server Channel
web users still have no Assurance about
what happens at the other
end although wireless networks offer
great flexibility they have their own
security problems a hacker can sniff the
network packets without having to be in
the same building where the network is
located as wireless networks communicate
through radio waves a hacker can easily
sniff the network from a nearby location
most most attackers use Network sniffing
to find the SSID and hack a wireless
network an attacker can attack a network
from a distance and therefore it is
sometimes difficult to collect evidence
against the main
hacker social engineering is the artart
of manipulating uses of a Computing
system into revealing confidential
information which can be later used to
gain unauthorized access to a computer
system the term can also include
activities such as exploiting human
kindness greed and curiosity to gain
access to restricted access buildings or
getting the users to installing backdoor
software knowing the tricks used by
hackers to trick users into releasing
vital login information is fundamental
in protecting computer
systems coming to our main focus for
today let us have a look at the top five
most essential ethical hacking tools to
be used in
2021 at the top of the chain lies n map
nmap which stands for network mapper is
a free and open- Source utility for
network discovery and security auditing
many systems and network administrators
also find it useful for tasks such as
Network inventory managing service
upgrade schedules and monitoring host or
service up time it is most beneficial in
the early stages of ethical hacking
where a hacker must figure the possible
entry point to a system before running
the necessary exploits thus allowing the
hackers to leverage any insecure
openings and thus breach the
device nmap users raw IP packets in
novel ways to determine what hosts are
available on the network what service
they are running what operating systems
are installed what type of packet
filters and firewalls are in Ed and
dozens other characteristics it was
designed to rapidly scan large networks
but works F against single host as well
since every application that connects to
a network needs to do so via a port the
wrong port or a server configuration can
open a can of worms which lead to a
thorough breach of the system and
ultimately a fully hacked
device next on our list we have
Metasploit the Metasploit framework is a
very powerful tool that can be used by
cyber criminals as well as ethical
hackers to probe systematic
vulnerabilities on both networks and
servers because it's an open source
framework it can be easily customized
and used with most operating systems
with metas flit the ethical hacking team
can use readymade or custom code and
introduce it into a network to probe for
weak spots as another flavor of threat
hunting once the flaws are identified
and documented the information can be
used to address systemic weaknesses and
prioritize
Solutions once a particular
vulnerability is identified and the
necessary exploit is fed into the system
there are a host of options for the
hacker depending on the vulnerability
hackers can even run root commands from
the terminal allowing complete control
over the activities of the compromise
system as well as all the personal data
stored on the
device a big advantage of Metasploit is
the ability to run full-fledged scans on
the target system which gives a detailed
picture of the security index of the
system along with the necessary exploits
that can be used to bypass the antivirus
softwares having a single solution to
gather almost all the necessary points
of attack is very useful for ethical
hackers and penetration testers as
denoted by its high rank in the
list moving on we have the acuns
framework atics is an endtoend web
security scanner which offers a 360°
view of an organization security it is
an application security testing tool
that helps the company address
vulnerability across all their critical
web
assets the need to be able to test
application in depth and further than
traditional vulnerability management
tools has created a market with several
players in the application security
space acuatic can detect over 7,000
vulnerabilities including SQL injections
cross- site scripting misconfigurations
weak passwords exposed database and
other outof band
vulnerabilities it can scan all pages
web apps and complex web applications
running HTML 5 and JavaScript as well it
also lets you scan complex multi-level
formoms and even password protected
areas of the
site actic is a dynamic application
security testing package which has
definite perks over status application
security testing Frameworks which are
also known as SAS scanners S tools only
work during development and only for
specific languages and have a history of
reporting lot of false positives whereas
Dynamic testing tools also known as D
have the ability to streamline testing
from development to deployment with
minimal
issues next on our list we have air
gedon this is a multi-use bash script
used for Linux systems to hack and audit
wireless networks like our everyday
Wi-Fi router and its counterparts along
with being able to launch denial of
service attacks on compromised networks
this multi-purpose wi-fi hacking tool
has very rich features which support
multiple methods for wi-fi hacking
including WPS hacking modes WP attacks
hand Shake captures evil twin and so
much
more it usually needs an external
network adapter that supports monitor
mode which is necessary to be able to
capture Wireless traffic that Traverse
the air
channels thanks to its open source
nature air Garden can be used with
multiple Community plugins and add-ons
thereby increasing its Effectiveness
against a wide variety of routers both
in the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz
band finally at number five we have John
the Ripper John the Ripper is an
open-source password security auditing
and the password recovery tool which is
available for many operating
systems John the Ripper jumbo supports
100 of hash and Cipher types including
for user passwords of operating systems
web apps database servers encrypted keys
and document files some of the key
features of the tool include offering
multiple modes to speed up the password
cracking automatically deselecting the
hashing algorithm used by the passwords
and the ease of running and
configurating the tool to make it
password cracking
easier it can use dictionary attacks
along with regular brute forcing to
speed up the process of cracking the
correct password without wasting
additional resources the word list being
used in these dictionary attacks can be
used by the users and allowing for a
completely customizable
process we also have a few honorary
mentions in our list that just missed
the cut next sparker for instance is an
automated yet fully configurable web
application security scanner that
enables you to scan websites web
applications and web services the
scanning technology is designed to help
you secure web applications easily
without any fuss so you can focus on
fixing the reported
vulnerabilities the burp suit
professional is one of the most popular
penetration testing and vulnerability
finder tools and it's used for checking
web application security the term burp
as it is commonly known as a proxy based
tool which is used to evaluate the
security of web-based application and to
do Hands-On testing moving away from
websites and applications yashar is a
free and open-source packet analyzer
which was launched in 2006 it is used
for Network troubleshooting analysis
software and Communications protocol
development and education it captures
Network traffic on the local network and
stores data for offline analysis VHA
captures Network traffic from ethernet
Bluetooth wireless networks and frame
relay
connections now that we learn about the
different types of tools that can be
used when conducting an ethical hacking
audit let's learn about some potential
benefits of such campaigns and why
organizations prefer to pay for such
audits being able to identify defects
from an attacker's perspective is
game-changing since it displays all the
potential Avenues of of a possible hack
one can only prepare for the known
vulnerabilities as a defensive
specialist but proactively trying to
breach a network or device can make
hackers think of techniques that no
defense contractors can account for this
kind of unpredictability goes a long way
in securing a network against malicious
actors another advantage of hiring
ethical hackers is the ability to
preemptively fix possible weak points in
a company's Network infrastructure as
seen on many occasions
a real breach will cause loss of data
and irreparable damage to the foundation
of an
organization being able to gauge such
shortcomings before they become public
and can be used exploited is a benefit
most organizations make use
of this is not to imply that such
security audits are only beneficial to
the organization paying for it when
coming across companies that provide
certain Services a reliable thirdparty
security audit goes a long way in
instilling trust and confidence over the
CR
if the ethical hackers cannot find any
major vulnerabilities that can be
leveraged by hackers it just accentuates
the technical brillance of the
organization and its Engineers thereby
increasing the clientele by a
substantial amount who sits to switch
careers with cyber security by learning
from the experts then try giving a short
to Simply lar postgraduate program in
cyber security with modules from MIT
schwas man College of Engineering the
link is mentioned in the description box
that will navigate to the course page
where you can find a complete of the
program being offered imagine our houses
without a fence or boundary wall this
would make our properly easy accessible
to trespassers and robbers and place our
homes at Great risk right hence fencing
our property helps safeguarded and keeps
trespassers at Bay similarly imagine our
computers and networks without
protection this would increase the
probability of hackers infiltrating our
networks to overcome this challenge just
like how boundary walls protect our
houses a virtual wall helps Safeguard
and secure our devices from Intruders
and such a wall is known as a firewall
firewalls are security devices that
filter the incoming and outgoing traffic
within a private Network for example if
you were to visit your friend who lives
in a gated community you would First
Take permission from the security guard
the security guard would check with your
friend if you should be allowed to entry
or not if all is well your access is
granted on the other hand
the security guard would not Grant
permission to a trespasser looking to
enter the same premises here the entry
access depends solely on your friend the
resident's discretion the role of the
security guard in this case is similar
to that of a firewall the firewall works
like a gatekeeper at your computer's
entry point which only welcomes incoming
traffic that it has been configured to
accept firewalls filter the network
traffic within your network and analyzes
which traffic should be allowed or
restricted based on on a set of rules in
order to spot and prevent cyber attacks
your computer communicates with the
internet in the form of network packets
that hold details like the source
address destination address and
information these Network packets enter
your computer through ports the firewall
works on a set of rules based on the
details of these Network packets like
their Source address a destination
address content and port numbers only
trusted traffic sources or IP addresses
are allowed to enter your network when
you connect your computer to the
internet there is a high chance of
hackers infiltrating your network this
is when a firewall comes to your Rescue
by acting as a barrier between your
computer and the internet the firewall
rejects the malicious data package and
thus protects your network from hackers
on the other hand traffic from trusted
websites is allowed access to your
network this way the firewall carries
out quick assessments to detect malware
and other suspicious activities thereby
protecting your network from being
susceptible to a Cyber attack firewalls
can either be Hardware or software
software firewalls are programs
installed on each computer this is also
called a host firewall meanwhile
Hardware firewalls are equipments that
are established between the Gateway and
your network linky routers are a good
example of a hardware firewall besides
this there are other types of firewalls
designed based on their traffic
filtering methods structure and
functionality the firewall that compares
each each outgoing and incoming Network
packet to a set of established rules
such as the allowed IP addresses IP
protocols port number and other aspects
of the packet is known as a packet
filtering firewall if the incoming
Network traffic is not for the
predefined rules that traffic is blocked
a variant of the packet filtering
firewall is the stateful inspection
firewall these types of firewalls not
only examine each Network packet but
also checks whether or not that Network
packet is part of an established network
connection such firewalls are also
referred to as Dynamic packet filtering
firewalls our next type of firewall is
called a proxy firewall this draws close
comparison to how you give proxy
attendance for a friend like how you
take the authority to represent your
friend the proxy firewall pretends to be
you and interacts with the internet they
come between you and the internet and
thereby prevents direct connections this
protects your device's identity and
keeps the network safe from potential
tax only if the incoming data packet
contents are protected the proxy
firewall transfers it to you they're
also known as application Level Gateway
the firewall can spot malicious actions
and block your computer from receiving
data packets from harmful sources in
addition to preventing cyber attacks
firewalls are also used in educational
institutions and offices to restrict
users access to certain websites or
applications it is used to avoid access
to unauthorized content it's the year
2015 and Richard has just finished
playing games on his computer after a
long gaming session Richard tries to
shut it down but find some random text
file on the desktop that says Ransom
note the text file mentioned how a
hacking group had encrypted Richard's
game files and private documents and he
had to pay a ransom of $500 worth of
bitcoin in a specified Bitcoin address
Richard quickly checked his files only
to see them being encrypted and
unreadable this is the story of how the
Tesla Crypt ransomware spread in 2015
which affected thousands of Gamers
before releasing the master key used for
encrypting the files so what is
ransomware for Richard to be targeted by
such an attack he must have installed
applications from untrusted sources or
clicked an unverified link both of them
can function as gateways for a
ransomware breach ransomware is a type
of malware that encrypts personal
information and documents while
demanding a ransom amount to decrypt
them this Ransom payment is mainly done
using cryptocurrency to ensure anonymity
but can also employ other routes once
the files are encrypted or locked behind
a password ATT text file is available to
the victim explaining how to make the
ransom payment and unlock the files for
it just like Richard found the ransom
node text file on his desktop even after
the money has been paid there's no
guarantee that the hackers will send the
decryption key or unlock the files but
in certain sensitive situations victims
make the payment hoping for the best
having never been introduced to
ransomware attacks before this gave
Richard an opportunity to learn more
about this and he began his research on
the topic the spread of ransomware
mostly starts with fishing attacks to
know more about fishing attacks click
the link in the button above users tend
to click on unknown links received via
emails and chat applications promising
rewards of some nature once clicked the
r someware files installed on the system
that encrypts all the files or blocks
access to computer functions they can
also be spread via malware transmitted
via untrusted application installation
or even a compromised wireless network
another way to breach a system with
ransomware is by using the remote
desktop protocol or RDP access a
computer can be accessed remotely using
this protocol allowing a hacker to
install malicious software on the system
with the owner unaware of these
developments coming to the different
types of ransomware first we have Locker
ransomware which is a type of malware
that blocks standard computer functions
from being accessed until the payment to
the hackers is complete it shows a log
screen that doesn't allow the victim to
use the computer for even basic purposes
another type is crypto ransomware which
encrypts the local files and documents
in the computers once the files are
encrypted finding the decryption key is
impossible unless the ransomware variant
is is old and the keys are already
available on the Internet scareware is
fake software that claims to have
detected a virus or other issue on your
computer and directs you to pay to
resolve the problem some types of
scareware lock the computer While others
simply flood the screen with pop-up
alerts without actually damaging files
to prevent getting affected by
ransomware Richard could have followed a
few steps to further enhance his
security one must always have backups of
their data cloud storage for backup is
easy but a physical backup in a hard
drive is always recommended keeping the
system updated with the latest security
patches is always a good idea apart from
system updates one must always have
reputed antivirus software installed
many antivirus software like kasperski
and Bit Defender have anti-ransomware
features that periodically check for
encryption of private documents when
browsing the internet a user must always
check for the lock symbol on the address
bar with which signifies the presence of
https protocol for additional security
if a system is infected with ransomware
already there's a website Noor ransom.
org it has a collection of decryption
tools for most well-known ransomware
packages it can also help decrypt
specific encrypted files if the list of
anti-ransomware tools didn't help the
victim malware is a malicious software
that is programmed to cause damage to a
computer system Network and Hardware
devices
many malicious programs like prion
viruses bombs and Bots which cause
damage to the system are known as
malware most of the malware programs are
designed to steal information from the
targeted user or to steal money from the
Target by stealing sensitive
data let's take a look at the
introduction for two different types of
malware virus and
Trojan firstly let's take a look what
exactly is a virus program
a computer virus is a type of malicious
program that on execution replicates
itself they get attached to different
files and programs which are termed as
host programs by inserting their code if
the attachment succeeds the targeted
program is termed as infected with a
computer virus now let's take a look at
the Trojan Horse Trojan Horse program is
a program that disguises itself as a
legitimate program but harms the system
on installation they hide within the
attachments and emails then transfer
from one system to another they create
back doors into a system to allow the
cyper criminal to steal our
information let's take a look how they
function after getting installed into
our
system firstly we have virus programs
the computer virus must contain two
parts to infect the system first is a
search routine which locates new files
and data that is to be infected by the
virus
program and the second part is known as
the copy routine which is necessary for
the program to copy itself into the
targeted file which is located by the
search routine now let's take a look at
the troan horse
functioning for Trojan horses entryway
into our system is through emails that
may look legitimate but may have unknown
attachments and when such files are
downloaded into the device the tro
program gets installed and infects the
system
they also infect the system on the
execution of infected application or the
executable file and attacks the
system now that we understand what virus
and rions are let's understand different
types of virus and
rions let's take a look at different
types of viruses the first one is known
as the boot sector virus this type of
virus damages the booting section of the
system by infecting the masterbot record
which is also known as MBR this damages
the boot sector section by targeting the
hard disk of the
system then we have the macro virus
macrovirus is a type of virus that gets
embedded into the document related data
and is executed when the file is open
they also are designed to replicate
themselves and infect the system on a
larger scale and lastly we have the
direct action
virus this type of virus gets attached
to executable files which on execution
activates the virus program and infects
the system once the infection of the
file is completed they exit the system
which is also the reason it is known as
a non-resident virus let's take a look
at different types of
prion the first type of troan is the
back door troan they are designed to
create a back door in the system on
execution of an infected program they
provide remote access of a system to the
hacker this way the Cyber criminal can
steal our system data and may use it for
illegal activities next we have Crick
sour verion they enter the system by
clicking the random popups which we come
across on the internet they attemp the
user to give their personal details for
different transactions or
schemes which may provide remote access
off a system to the Cyber
criminal and the last troan type is
Ransom troan this type of troan program
after entering the system blocks the
user from accessing its own system and
also affects the system
functioning the Cyber criminal Demands a
ransom from the targeted user for the
removal of the Trojan program from the
device now that we understand some
details regarding viruses and troan
let's solve a
question the question is Jake was denied
access to his system and he wasn't able
to control the data and information in
his system
system now the actual question is what
could be the reason behind this system's
problem option a macrovirus option b
Ransom troan option C backd Door troen
give your answers in the comment
section now let's understand how to
detect the activity of viruses and Tran
in our
system to detect virus Orion activity in
a system we can refer to the following
points for viruses we have slowing down
of the system and frequent application
freeze shows that the infection of the
virus is present in the
system then we have the viruses can also
steal sensitive data including passwords
Account Details which may lead to
unexpected log out from the accounts or
Corruption of the sensitive data and
lastly we have frequent system crashes
due to virus infection which damages the
operating system for Trojan we have
frequent system crashes and system also
faces slow reaction time then we have
there are more random popups from the
system which may indicate troan activity
and lastly we have modification in the
system application and change of the
desktop appearance can be also due to
the infection of a Trojan
program next let's take a look at a
famous Cyber attack for virus and a
trogen
hor for virus we have the myom virus
which was identified in the year 2004
which affected over 50 million systems
by creating a network of sending spam
emails which was to gain back door
access into our
systems next for the Trojan hor we have
the emotet troan program which is a
specifically designed for financial
theft and for stealing Bank related
information next we have few points for
how to prevent virus entry or rosion
attack for our
system the most basic way of virus
protection is to using antivirus Ando
regular viruses can this will prevent
virus entry in the system and also
having more than one antivirus provides
birge better
protection then avoid visiting
uncertified websites can also prevent
virus entry into our
system then we have using regular driver
updates and system some updates to
prevent virus entry for troan we have
using certified softwares from legal
sites to prevent any troan activity in
our
system and also avoid clicking random
popups that we often see on the internet
and lastly using antivirus and Fireballs
for protection against troan horses is a
good
habit now that we have reached the end
of the video Let's Take a look what we
learned for the first part
we saw the main objective of the virus
is to harm the data and information in a
system whereas for the troan we have
stealing of the data files and
information effect of viruses is more
drastic in comparison to the Trojan
horses then we have viruses which are
non- remote programs whereas troen
horses are remote access and lastly
viruses have the ability to replicate
itself to harm multiple files
whereas Trojan does not have the
replication ability so let's begin with
what is SQL
injection as the name suggest SQL
injection vulnerability allows an
attacker to inject malicious input into
a SQL statement so SQL stands for
structured query language which is a
language used by an application to
interact with a database now normally
this attack is targeted towards a
database to extract uh the data that is
stored within however the vulnerabil
does not lie in the database itself the
vulnerability will always lie in the
application it is the developers
prerogative of how to develop the
application how to configure it to
prevent SQL injection queries from
happening a database is created to
answer questions and if a question is
asked it is supposed to answer it
database needs to be configured for some
amount of security but the vulnerability
the flaw here for SQL injection will
always lie in the application itself it
is how how the application interacts
with the database that needs to be
modified that needs to be maintained by
the developer rather than just
configuring the database itself so the
attacker at this point in time when they
send a query to the application will
form a malformed query by injecting a
particular command or an operator that
is recognized by the SQL language and if
that operator is passed through the
application to the database then the
database uh basically gets cracked or
does a data dump because of that
unwanted character coming in so this
character needs to be filtered at the
application Level itself now let's look
at a quick demo so what we have done
here is I have this virtual machine
called oasp broken web applications
virtual machine version 1.2 I'm going to
power this
on till this power is on I'm going to
show you where we can download this uh
utility from so you can just look for
OAS broken web application project
download you'll find it on Source
for.net click on the
link you can download the broken web
application project from here this is a
1.9gb download and you can have a zip
machine directly for VMware or a Oracle
virtual box now this is an application
that has been developed by oasp which
stands for open web application security
project which is a not for-profit
organization and uh periodically
releases the most top 10 risks that an
application uh will face for that
particular
year so they have given a web
application uh with inbuilt
vulnerabilities for professionals like
us to practice upon to develop our our
skills upon because doing this in the
real world is illegal I cannot go onto a
website to demonstrate how a SQL
injection attack Works uh neither should
you try your hands on it till you become
very well rehearsed with it so till to
upgrade your skills to upskill yourself
please download this machine hosted in a
VM workstation or Oracle virtual box and
you can uh then try your skills on it
right so just going back to the browser
here if I open up uh a new tab you'll
see that this machine has booted up and
has an IP address called 71. 132 so if I
just go on to that IP address and I type
in 192 168
7132 and you'll see the OAS broken web
application project and there are lot of
training applications realistic
intentionally vulnerable applications
old versions of real applications and so
on so forth so there is a lot of
applications in built over here that you
can try your skills upon we are going to
try to use the ovas mutil day over here
uh this gives you the uh o top 10 risks
for 2010 2013 2017 is the latest one so
far uh but the difference between 2013
and 2017 is that some of these have
changed but not all of them uh the order
has change a little bit but you can see
that SQL injection is on the top A1
amongst the injection attacks right and
you can see there are multiple types
that have been given here the SQL
injection for extracting data or SQL
injection for bypass authentication or
insert your injection uh attacks blind
SQL injection and then there is a tool
called SQL map which is available freely
on your Linux machines Ki Linux or parot
Linux whichever you want to use uh for
your practice targets and so on so forth
so if I just take you here for bypass
authentication and this is a regular
login page that an application may have
right you look at a username you look at
password you type that in and you log in
so let's say I don't know a password
here I'm just going to type in the
username test password is PSS WD I try
to log in and it shows me that the
account does not exist so the
authentication mechanism does work I did
try type in a username and password it
wasn't recognized so the account does
not exist now let's try to type in a SQL
query here I'm going to just give it a
single quote which is an operator that
is recognized by the SQL language which
when the database tries to execute uh
will cause the database to uh dump some
data or to bypass authentication in this
case and I'm going to give it a
condition single
quote or 1 equal 1 space hyphen hyen
space and I'm going to click on login
now right now I'm not logged in at all
and we tried our username and password
and we weren't able to log in so now if
I log in you will see that it give me a
step status update saying the user has
been authenticated and I'm logged in as
admin got root so that is what the SQL
queries can achieve I'm going to log out
right now and uh we're going to look at
the basics of SQL injection so looking
at that small demo looking now let's
look at what types of SQL injections are
available so the first is inband SQL
injection the there are two subtypes
within inband error based injection
attack and a union based injection
attack the second type is blind SQL
injection attack where there's a Boolean
based and a Time based attack and the
third one is out of bound SQL injection
attack now what is inband SQL injection
attack inband is where you're either
attempting the error based or the union
based what is error based uh we send a
query to the database we craft a query
to the database and uh it generates an
error M message and it dumps the error
message right in front of us on this
screen that uh makes us realize that
there is a flaw and there there is some
information that is dumped on the screen
which we can then further utilize to
craft our further queries as we go ahead
whereas Union base is the it is where we
combine multiple statements at the same
time so if you look at the URL earlier
in the URL you would see a large
structure in that URL uh we can try to
add more two or more statements within
the URL itself to combine them and then
confuse the database into executing both
the statements together and giving a
data dump at the same time right so what
would a error based uh SQL injection
look like if I go back to the same
database uh which is here right and if
you remember in the username we gave it
a single quote r 1 equals one space
hyphen hyen space we gave it the
condition right so basically what it did
was this a single code is an operator
that goes to the database selects the
default uh table uh in the user tables
in this database column and then
Compares it to the condition that is
given so the condition that we gave was
1 equals 1 which is always true so what
it did was it selected the default uh
user table that was available in the
database and instead of comparing it to
a password it compared it to the
condition so if I give it 1 equals 2
where the condition is is false and if I
log in you will see that the account
doesn't exist comes back again because
the condition was false and instead of
comparing the user account to the
password it basically uh compared the
user account to the condition so if I
give it a single quote or 1 equals 1
hyphen hyphen space uh and log in you
can see that this is a correct condition
and thus we are able to log in now
before we even go uh to that extent if I
just forget the condition over here and
I just give it a single code the
operator and I send this operator to the
database and I click on login you will
see that it generates an error which is
right on top and it tells us the line
the uh file where the error happened and
you can see it happened in the MySQL
handler. PHP file right and then it give
us the message you have an error in your
SQL syntax check the manual that
corresponds to your MySQL server version
for the right syntax to use now why
would a hacker want to do this in the
first place because there are different
types of databases so there is a MySQL
Ms SQL or Microsoft SQL Oracle SQL IBM
db2 all of these are variations of the
SQL database uh they use the SQL
language however every database has its
own Command right they they have their
own syntax they have their own uh
specific commands that are utiliz for
the database so in this scenario the
hacker wants to identify what database
is being currently utilize so they can
craft those particular queries so now
with this injection with just me sending
the quote and the error getting
generated I now come to know that we are
using a MySQL server and the version of
that server is 5.1. 73 and uh the rest
of the information about uh where the
handlers are located and so on so forth
right this gives the information to the
hacker of how they want to proceed next
what kind of queries they want to create
what kind of syntax they want to utilize
so error based attack is where you
generate these kind of Errors uh and you
get this information the union base is
where you craft your queries within the
URL or you can try to combine multiple
statements within the input fields and
try to generate a response from that
then we come to Boolean based SQL
injection uh sends a SQL query to the
database which forces the application to
return a different result depending on
whether the query returns a true or a
false result so basically if the input
is false the input both the inputs are
false the output would be false uh
there's one input that is false the
other input that is true input B the
output would be true and so on so forth
right so depending on the result from
the inputs the attacker will come to
know which input is true with this he
can then access the database of the
website so you're trying to figure out
by sending out multiple inputs uh and
then analyzing the output to to see what
exactly uh which command exactly worked
what was the resultant output of that
command thus from this kind of an
information the hacker can infer their
next step forward then you have time
based SQL injections uh now there are
times when a database administrator an
application administrator has done some
security configuration and does have
disabled verbos error messages now what
is a verbos error message the error
message message that we saw right here
is a verbos error message that means
that the message gives out details the
message gives out details about what the
database is the version and whatnot so
if they have sanitized these
errors and you no longer can generate
these errors and thus you cannot figure
out what database is then what do you do
right for example if I just take you to
Simply learn
and take you to a URL that is supposedly
not accessible you can see that it gives
a generic error oops like it looks like
you have crash landed on Mars it doesn't
give you a verbo error that we saw here
so this gives us a detail error of what
went wrong where it gives us the
database the version of the database and
uh where the query went wrong and etc
etc etc whereas on this side where
there's some there's a lot of security
that goes in here so you can see that it
doesn't generate a error it just get a
generic page in front of you so in that
case what does a hacker do so the hacker
then injects a Time based uh query in
the URL which allows us to verify
whether the command is being executed or
not so uh we put in a time
weit let's say 10 seconds of time weit
so if we the moment we inject the query
if the query times for 10 seconds and
then gets executed that means that the
SQL injection is possible however if we
inject the query and uh it just gets
executed without the delay that means
that the time uh injection attack would
not be
uh possible on that particular site out
of bound is not a very common attack it
depends on the features being enabled on
the database management system that is
being used by the web application so
this can be a somewhat of a
misconfiguration error uh by the
database administrator where you have
enabled functions and not sanitized them
so you have not done in access controls
properly you have not given account
control so queries should never be
executed at an administrative level
level they should always be uh executed
at a user level with minimum privileges
that are required for that query to be
executed now if you're allowing these
kind of functions to be uh to be enabled
at the dbms and there's an
administrative account that can have
access to them at that point in time an
outof bound injection attack is possible
so let's look at how a website works
right uh how SQL works on a website now
the website is constructed of HTML
hypertext markup language uh which would
include javascripting for functionality
cascading stylesheet for the mapping of
the website right and then reactjs and
whatnot uh for further functionality now
when we send a query to the website it
is normally using the HTTP protocol or
https protocol when the query reaches
the application the application would
then go ahead and generate the SQL query
uh at the client side you'll have uh all
these scripting languages coming in on
the front end uh that we can utilize to
craft queries and then send them across
at the server side you'll have uh
databases like Oracle MySQL Ms SQL and
so on so forth that will then execute
those queries right so just to give you
an example if I use a tool called
Postman what we generally do uh when we
craft a query is we send out a uh get
request to the website and then we
receive a response from the site uh with
the HTML code and everything so this is
a tool that is utilized by software
testers to test the responses that
you're going to get from various
websites so on the left hand side you
can see I've uh used it on quite a bit
uh here we have a example for gmail.com
so let's continue with that so this is a
get request being sent to Gmail the
moment I send it it's going to create an
HTTP request and send it across the
response that I get is this this is the
HTML code for
gmail.com right these are the cookies uh
these are the headers uh that include
information so it you can see this is a
text HTML character set utilized is
utf8 and the configuration uh that has
been done with the application right so
this is where uh everything comes in
this is the cookie that has been sent
with that particular uh request that I
had sent out now if you Analyze This
query right so when we went onto this
application and typed in that single
quote and we generated this error right
uh you can see that the application
converted this into a SQL query so the
query was select username from accounts
where the username in quote single
quotes and we use the quote right the
single code right there so uh that's
where we use that operator and that's
where the exception error occurred so
these are the kind of queries that are
structured by the application and then
taken on to the database for execution
ution when we type in uh it is a HTTP
get request with the username and
password within that query uh that is
sent to the application the application
converts it into a SQL query sends it to
the database and the database responds
with the appropriate response so how do
we prevent SQL injection in the first
place use prepared statement and
parameterized queries uh these
statements make sure that the parameters
passed into SQL statements are treated
in a safe manner so for example we saw
that the single code was an operator
this shouldn't be allowed to be utilized
in the first place right so here what we
are doing here is a secure way of
running a SQL query in the jdbc using a
parameterized statement Define which
user we want to find so there's a string
the email comes in connection to the
database we are going to figure out how
the connection is going to be passed how
it is going to be created construct the
SQL statement we want to run specifying
the parameter right so we Define how is
it going to be uh created what is going
to be created what can be passed to the
database and what should not be passed
to the database so that is one way of
utilizing prepared statements and
parameterized queries then we have
object relational mapping most
development uh teams prefer to use
object object relational mapping
Frameworks to make the translation of
SQL results set into code objects more
seamless so this is an example of object
relational mapping uh where we map
certain object objects and allow that to
be executed and then escaping inputs it
a simple way to protect against most SQL
injection attacks many languages have
standard functions to achieve this right
so you need to be very careful while
using Escape characters in your codee
base when a SQL statement is constructed
not all injection attacks rely on abuse
of code characters so you need to know
what characters are being utilized uh in
the configuration that you have created
in the structure that you have created
in the code that you have created uh
which characters are being recognized as
operators you need to sanitize those
operators and you need to uh basically
ensure that these operators cannot be
accepted as user input if they are
they're Ved out by the application and
they never reach the database other
methods of uh preventing SQL injection
are uh password hashing so that
passwords cannot be bypassed the
passwords cannot be recovered passwords
cannot be cracked uh third party
authentic ation you use o or some other
service for a single sign on mechanism
does uh you rely on a third party to
maintain the security of authentication
and uh what kind of parameters are
passed for example uh using LinkedIn
logins or Facebook logins right uh for
the Layman you normally go onto Facebook
and you allow if you're using a game
right if you start playing a game you're
allowed to log into the game using your
Facebook credentials or your Google
credentials now that is not just for
ease of use but the game user the
developer has outsourced the
authentication mechanisms to third Pary
such as Facebook or Google because they
understand that that authentication
mechanism is as safe as can be Facebook
and Google are wealthy organizations uh
hire a lot of Security Experts and the
development for their authentication
mechanisms is topnotch small
organization cannot spend that kind of
oneu on security itself right so you use
a third party authentication mechanism
to ensure that these kind of attacks may
not happen then web application
firewalls uh having a web application
firewall and configuring it properly uh
for SQL injection attacks is one of the
Sure Shot method of uh mitigating or
minimizing the uh threat in the first
place so at this point in time you have
realized that the application has some
vulnerabilities for SQL injection and
instead of decoding or restructuring the
application uh you want to take the
easier way out or the cheaper way out so
what you do is you uh you install a web
application firewall and you configure
the web application firewall to identify
malicious queries and stop them uh at
the firewall level itself so they never
reach the application and thus the
vulnerabilities on the application don't
get
executed buy better
software and keep on updating the
software so it's not necessary that once
you have a software Ware you install it
it's going to be safe for Life new V
abilities are discovered every day every
hour and it may so happen what is secure
today maybe completely insecure tomorrow
or the day after right so you need to
keep on upgrading the software if there
are no upgrades available and the vity
still exist you might want to migrate to
a better software and does ensure that
you don't get hacked right always update
and use patches organizations keep on
sending out updates and patches as and
when they are released you need to
install them to uh enhance your security
postures and then continuously monitor
SQL statements and databases use
protocol monitors uh use different
softwares use the firewalls to keep on
monitoring what kind of queries you uh
getting and based on those queries you
want to ensure the inputs and the
queries that are creating uh are not
detrimental to the health of the
software that you have Jane is relaxing
at home when she receives an email from
a bank that asks her to update her
credit card pin in the next 24 hours as
a security measure judging the severity
of the message Jane follows the link
provided in the email on delivering her
current credit card pin and the
supposedly updated one the website
became unresponsive which prompted her
to try sometime later however after a
couple of hours she noticed a
significant purchase from a random
website on that same credit card which
she never authorized frantically
contacting the bank Jane realized the
original email was a counterfeit or a
fake message with a malicious link that
entailed credit card fraud this is a
classic example of a fishing attack
fishing attacks are a type of social
engineering where fraudulent message is
sent to a Target on the premise of
arriving from a trusted Source its basic
purpose is to trick the victim into
revealing sensitive information like
passwords and payment information it's
based on the word fishing which works on
the concept of baits if a supposed
victim catches the bait the attack can
go ahead which in our case makes Jane
the fish and the fishing emails the bait
if Jane never opened the malicious link
or was cautious about the email
authenticity an attack of this nature
would have been relatively
ineffective but how does the hacker gain
access to these credentials a fishing
attack starts with a fraudulent message
which can be transmitted via email or
chat appli ations even using SMS
conversations to impersonate legitimate
sources is known as smishing which is a
specific category of fishing attacks
irrespective of the manner of
transmission the message targets the
victim in a way that coaxes them to open
a malicious link and provide critical
information on the requisite website
more often than not the websites are
designed to look as authentic as
possible once the victims submit
information using the link be it a
password or credit credit card details
the data is sent to the hacker who
designed the email and the fake website
giving him complete control over the
account whose password was just provided
often carried out in campaigns where an
identical fishing mail is sent to
thousands of users the rate of success
is relatively low but never zero between
2013 and 2015 corporate giants like
Facebook and Google were tricked off of
$100 million due to an extensive fishing
campaign where a known common associate
was impersonated by the hackers apart
from credit access some of these
campaigns Target the victim device and
install malware when clicked on the
malicious links which can later function
as a botn net or a target for ransomware
attacks there is no single formula for
there are multiple categories of fishing
attacks the issue with Jane where the
hacker stole her bank credentials falls
under the umbrella of deceptive fishing
a general email is sent out to thousands
of users in this category
hoping some of them fall prey to this
scam spear fishing on the other hand is
a bit customized version the targets are
researched before being sent an email
for example if you never had a Netflix
subscription sending you an email that
seems like the Netflix Team sends it
becomes pointless this is a potential
drawback of deceptive fishing techniques
on the other hand a simple screenshot of
a Spotify playlist being shared on
social media indicates a probable point
of entry the hack ER can send
counterfeit messages to the Target user
while implying the source of such
messages being Spotify tricking them
into sharing private information since
the hacker already knows the target uses
Spotify the chances of victims taking
the bait increase substantially for more
important targets like CEOs and people
with a fortune on their back the
research done is 10-fold which can be
called a case of wailing the hackers
prepare and wait for the right moment to
launch their fishing attack often to
still industry Secret secret for rival
companies or sell them off at a higher
price apart from just emails farming
focuses on fake websites that resemble
their original counterparts as much as
possible a prevalent method is to use
domain names like Facebook with a single
o or YouTube with no e these are
mistakes that people make when typing
the full URL in the browser leading them
straight to a counterfeit web page which
can fool them into submitting private
data a few more complex methods exist to
drive people onto fake websites like ARP
spoofing and DNS cash poisoning but they
are rarely carried out due to time and
resource constraints now that we know
how fishing attacks work let's look at
ways to prevent ourselves from becoming
victims while the implications of a
fishing attack can be extreme protecting
yourself against these is relatively
straightforward Jane could have saved
herself from credit card fraud had she
check the link in the email for
authenticity and that it redirected to a
secure website that runs on the 8 https
protocol even suspicious messages
shouldn't be entertained one must also
refrain from entering private
information on random websites or popup
Windows irrespective of how legitimate
they seem it is also recommended to use
secure anti- fishing browser extensions
like cloudfish to sniff out malicious
emails from legitimate ones the best way
to prevent fishing is browsing the
internet with care and being on alert
for malicious attempts at all times
start by learning about cross-site
scripting from a Layman's
perspective cross-site scripting also
known as xss is a type of code injection
attack that occurs on the client side
the attacker intends to run harmful
scripts in the victim's web browser by
embedding malicious code in a genuine
web page or online application the real
Attack takes place when the victim hits
the malicious code infected web page or
online application the web page or
application serves as a vehicle for the
malicious script to be sent to the users
browser forums message boards and online
pages that enable comments are
vulnerable vehicles that are frequently
utilized for cross scripting
assaults a web page or web application
is vulnerable to accss if the output it
creates contains unsanitized user input
the victim's browser must then parse
this user input in VB script ActiveX
Flash and even CSS cross-side scripting
attacks are conceivable they are
nevertheless list most ubiquitous in
JavaScript going to the fact that
JavaScript is most important to most
browser experiences
nowadays the main purpose of this attack
is to steal the other users identity be
it via cookies session tokens and other
information in most of the cases this
attack is being used to steal the other
person's cookies as we know cookies help
us to log in automatically therefore
with the stolen cookies we can log in
with other identities and this is one of
the reasons why this attack is
considered as one of the riskiest
attacks it can be performed with
different client side programming
languages as
well cross-side scripting is often
compared with similar client side
attacks as client side languages are
mostly being used during this however an
xss attack is considered riskier because
of its ability to damage even less
vulnerable
Technologies most often this attack is
performed with JavaScript and HTML
JavaScript is a programming language
that runs on web web pages inside your
browser the client site code adds
functionality and interactivity to the
web page and is used extensively on all
major applications and CMS platforms
unlike servers side languages such as
PHP JavaScript code runs inside your
browser and cannot impact the website
for other visitors it is sandboxed to
your own Navigator and can only perform
actions within your own browser window
while JavaScript is client site and does
not run on the server it can be used to
interact with the server by performing
background requests attackers can then
use these background requests to add
unwanted spam content to a web page
without refreshing it they can then
gather analytics about the client's
browser or perform actions
asynchronously the manner of attack can
range in a variety of ways it can be a
single link which the user must click on
to initiate a JavaScript piece of code
it can be used to show any piece of
images that can be later used as a front
end for malicious code being installed
as malware with the majority of Internet
users unaware of how metadata works or
the ways in which web requests are
called the chances of victims clicking
on a redirecting links is far too high
cross-side scripting can occur on the
malicious script executed at the
client's site using a fake page or even
a form that is displayed to the user on
websites with displayed advertisements
malicious emails can also be sent to the
victim these attacks occur when the
malicious user finds the vulnerable
parts of the website and send it as
appropriate malicious
input now that we understand the basics
of cross-side scripting let us learn
more about how this kind of attack
works the first place we have the
website or the web browser which is used
to show content to the victim or which
is the user in our case whenever the
user wants to grab some content from the
website the website asks the data from
the server the server provides this
information to the website and the web
browser browser which ultimately resist
the
victim how the hacker comes into play
here it passes on certain arguments to
the web browser which is can be then
forwarded back to the server or to the
user at hand the entire cross-site
scripting attack Vector means sending
and injecting malicious code or script
this attack can be performed in
different ways depending on the type of
attack the malicious script may be
reflected on the victim's browser but
stored in the database and executed
every time when the user calls the
appropriate function the main reason for
this attack is inappropriate users's
input validation where the malicious
input can get into the output a
malicious user can enter a script which
will be injected onto the website's code
then the browser is not able to know if
the executed code is malicious or not
therefore this malicious script is being
executed on the victim's browser or any
faked form if that is being displayed
for the users there are many ways to
trigger an xss attack for example the
execution could be triggered
automatically when the page loads or
when a user hovers over specific
elements of the page like hyperlinks
potential consequences of cross-site
scripting attacks include capturing
keystrokes of a user redirecting a user
to malicious websites running web
browser based exploits obtaining cookie
information of a user who is logged into
a website and many more in some cases
cross-site scripting attack leads to
complete compromise of of the victim's
account attackers can trick users into
entering credentials on a fake form
which can then provide all information
to the attacker with the basic working
of a cross-side scripting attack out of
the way let us go over the different
ways hackers can leverage vulnerable web
applications to gather information and
eventually breach those
systems the prime purpose of Performing
xss attack is to steal the other
person's identity as mentioned it may be
cookies tokens
Etc xss may also be used to display fake
Pages or forms for the victim however
this can be performed in several ways we
have a reflected attack this attack
occurs when a malicious script is not
being saved on the web server but is
reflected in the website results
reflected accss code is not being saved
permanently in this case the malicious
code is being reflected in any website
result the attack code can be included
in the faked URL or in the HTTP
parameters it can affect the victim in
different ways by displaying faked
malicious page or by sending a malicious
email in a reflected cross-side
scripting example the input of a search
form is reflected on the page to show
what the search key was an attacker May
craft a URL that contains malicious code
and then spread the same URL via email
or social media a user who clicks on
this link opens the valid web
application which then runs the
malicious code in the browser this the
script is not stored in the web
application and malicious code is shown
only to one user the user that opens the
link executes the script and the attack
is not necessarily visible on the server
side or to the app owner
itself the next variant is a stored
cross-side scripting attacks this occurs
when a malicious script is being saved
on the web server
permanently this can be considered a
riskier attack since it has leverage for
more damage in this type of attack the
malicious code or script is being saved
on the server for example in the
database of the website it is executed
every time the users call the
appropriate
functionality this way stored xss attack
can affect many users also as the script
is being stored on the web server it
will affect the website for a longer
time in order to perform stored xss
attack the malicious scripts should be
sent through the vulnerable input form
for example can be a comment field or a
review field
this way the appropriate script will be
saved in the database and evaluated on
the page load or appropriate function
calling in a stored xss example the
script might have been submitted via an
input field to the web server which did
not perform a sufficient validation and
stores the script permanently in the
database the consequence of this might
be that the script is now being
delivered to all users visiting the web
application and for example able to gain
access to the user session C
cookies in this attack the script is
permanently St in the web app the users
visiting the app after the information
retrieve the script the malicious code
then exploits the flaws in the web
application and the script and the
attack is visible on the server side or
to the app owner as
well the third variant is Dom based
cross-site scripting attacks this type
of attack occurs when the Dom
environment is being changed but the
client side code does not change when
the the Dom environment is being
modified in the victim's browser the
client side code executes differently in
order to get a better understand of how
xss Dom attack is being performed Let Us
analyze the following example if there
is a website called texting.com we know
default is a parameter therefore in
order to perform accss Dom attack we
should send a script as
parameters a Dom based accss attack may
be successfully executed even when the
server does not embed any Mal code into
the web page by using a flaw in the
JavaScript executed in the browser for
example if the client side JavaScript
modifies the Dom tree of the web page it
can be based on an input field or the
get parameter without validating the
input this allows the malicious code to
be
executed the malicious code the exploits
flaws in the browser on the user site
and the script and the attack is not
necessarily visible on the server side
or to the app owner
by now it is clear that cross-side
scripting attacks are difficult to
detect and even tougher to fight against
there are however plenty of feels one
can Safeguard against such attacks let's
go through some of these preventive
measures like mentioned earlier excesses
attacks are sometimes difficult to
detect however this can be changed if
you get some external help a way to
prevent excesses attacks is using
automated testing tools like crash test
security suit or actic security
suit still manual testing is highly
timec consuming and costly and therefore
not possible to be done for every
iteration of your web
application consequently your code
shouldn't be untested before any release
using automated security you can scan
your web application for cross-side
scripting and other critical
vulnerabilities before every release
this way you can ensure that your web
application live version is still
secured whenever you alter or add a
feature input fields are the most common
point of entry for xss attack script
therefore you should always screen and
validate any information input into data
fields this is particularly important if
the data will be included as HTML output
this can be used to protect against
reflected accss
attacks validation should occur on both
the client side and server side as an
added precaution this helps validate in
the data before it's being sent to the
servers and can also protect against
persistent xss scripts this can be
accomplished using JavaScript xss
attacks only appear if any user input is
being displayed on the web page
therefore try to avoid displaying any
untrusted user input if possible if you
need to display user data restrict the
places where the user input might appear
any input displayed inside a JavaScript
tag or a URL shown on the site is much
more likely to be exploited than the
input that appears inside a division or
a span element inside the HTML body
protecting against accss vulnerabilities
typically requires properly escaping
user provided data that is placed on the
page rather than trying to determine if
the data is user provided and could be
compromised we should always play it
safe and Escape data whether it is user
provided or not unfortunately because
there are many different rules for
escaping you still must choose the
proper type of escaping before settling
on a final
code encoding should be applied directly
before user controllable data is written
to a page because the context you're
writing into determines what kind of
encoding you need to use for example
values inside a JavaScript string
require a different type of escaping to
those in an HTML context sometimes
you'll need to apply multiple layers of
encoding in the correct order for
example to safely embed user input
inside an event event handler you need
to deal with both JavaScript context and
the HTML context so you need to First
Unicode escape the input and then HTML
encoded content security policy or CSP
is a computer security standard
introduced to prevent cross-site
scripting clickjacking and other code
injection attacks resulting from the
execution of malicious content in The
Trusted web page context it is a
candidate recommendations of the w3c
working group on web application
security it's widely supported by modern
web browsers and provides a standard
method for website owners to declare
approved origins of content that browser
should be allowed to load on that
website HTTP only is an additional flag
included in a set cookie HTTP response
header using the HTTP only flag when
generating a cookie helps mitigate the
risk of client side script accessing the
protected cookie that is if the browser
supports it if the http only flag is
included in the HTTP response header the
cookie cannot be accessed through a
client side script again this is if the
browser supports this flag as a result
even if a cross-side scripting flaw
exists and a user accidentally accesses
a link that exploits this flaw the
browser will not reveal the cookie to a
third party if a browser does not
support HTTP only and a website attempts
to set an HTTP only cookie the HTTP only
flag will be ignored browser browser
thus creating a traditional script
accessible cookie as a result the cookie
becomes vulnerable to theft of
modification by any malicious script
next on our docket is a live
demonstration where we solve a set of
cross-side scripting problems starting
from the basic level to the topmost
level six we're going to start at level
one in this web application it
demonstrates the common cause of
crosslite scripting by user input is
directly included in the page without
proper
escaping if you interact with a
vulnerable application window here and
find a way to make it execute JavaScript
of our choosing we can take actions
inside the vulnerable window or directly
edit its URL bar this task needs only
basic knowledge let's see why the most
primitive injections work here right
away let's do a simple query and inspect
the resulting HTML page
I'm going to use this
phrase with a single quote as a special
character we can now inspect the HTML
page we can see here in this
line the special character single code
appears in the result over
here the provided query text text is
placed directly in a b tag as in a body
element we need to perform a reflected
xss into the web application because
they are non-persistent xss attacks and
the P load should be included in the URL
to perform successful
exploitation we can use any payload but
we're going to use the simple one to
perform an alert in this web application
it's simple and can be shown
easily just going to write the script
over here
and we going to press
search as you can see we have
successfully launched our first
cross-site scripting attack we can see
an alert box popup with the necessary
message and a similar process can be
used to steal browser cookies and
passwords albe it with different
commands now we have the option to move
to level
two in this web application it shows
that how easily accss bugs can be
introduced in complex chat
applications chat app conversations are
stored in a database and reved when a
user wants to see the conversation
therefore if a malicious user injects
some JavaScript code all visitors will
be infected this kind of cross-site
scripting attack is more powerful and it
is more riskier than reflected
cross-site scripting attacks and that's
why is known as stored
xss I posted my
query with a special character of a
single quote and this is what I
get whatever I typed in simply appeared
on the page right after I click on share
status let's see the source
you can see here the text I posted seems
directly put inside a block code tag so
even a simple script tag we used in
level one should work here but it will
not let us examine the code to
understand
why we're going to toggle the code of
here and check the index. HTML file
important
part is line
32 the generated HTML fragment which is
the HTML variable in the code is added
to the male HTML using the inner HTML
method so when the browser passing this
HTML fragment it will not execute any
script tag defined within that HTML
fragment HTML parser will not execute a
script tag when it pares htmls via this
method this is why the script tag like
we used in level one is not going to
work here our solution is to use events
events will execute the Define
JavaScript we're going to use an image
over here
and when we press on share
status in the above injection we are
loading an image that doesn't exist
which causes to trigger an on error
event in on error event the it will
execute our alert method with that we
are able to beat level two and we can
now move up to the next level in our
challenge as you can see clicking on any
tab causes the tab number to be
displayed in the URL
fragment this hints that the value after
the hash tag controls the behavior of
the page that is it is an input variable
to confirm let's analyze the
code as you can see in line 43 inside
the event
handling the value provided after the
hash in the
URL is directly passed onto the chew tab
method no input validation is being
performed the value passed to the choose
tab method is directly injected into the
IMG tag in line
17 this is an unsafe assignment and it
is the vulnerable part of the code now
all we have to do now is to craft a
payload that would adjust the IMG tag to
execute our JavaScript remember the
script tag from level one would not work
here since the variable HTML is used to
add the Dom dynamically hence the events
are ases here once again I will choose
to use the existing IMG tag and change
the source to something that doesn't
exist hence forcing it to fall in to
execute an on error even which I will
pass the URL for
once we visit that URL we can see that
our Java popup has opened up here with
the same message of xss level 3 has been
completed with this we can now move on
to level four which is going to present
a different kind of
attack in this we application there is a
timer on the page that means whatever
numbers we put in the Box a countdown
starts and then when it finishes is the
application alerts that the countdown is
finished and we can see the time is a
popup appearing over here and this
resets the timer again now it is obvious
that the value entered in the text box
is transferred to the server over the
timer parameter in the
URL let us examine the code to see how
the timer parameter is being
handled we're going to visit timer. HTML
over here
and we're going to check over
here in line
21 the start timer method is being
called in the onload event however the
timer parameter is being directly passed
to the start timer method we need to
perform a popup Alert in the web
application which escapes the content of
the function start timer without
breaking the JavaScript code the
parameter value is directly added to the
start timer method without any filtering
what we can try to do here here is to
inject an alert function to be executed
inside the on loone event along with the
start timer
method we're going to remove this
argument and put our script over
here now I may press on create
timer and we have a popup with the xss
level 4 completed
we can now move on to level
five in this web application this
application xss is different cuz this
challenge description says cross-side
scripting isn't just about correctly
escaping
data sometimes attackers can do bad
things even without injecting new
elements into the Dom it's kind of open
redirect cuz the attack payload is
executed as a result of modifying the
Dom environment in the victim's browser
this environment is used by the original
client side script so that the client
side code runs in an unexpected manner
the vulnerability can be easily detected
if the next Link in the signup page is
inspected the href attribute value of
next link is confirm which is exact
exctly the value of the next URL query
parameter as you can see over here this
means using the next query parameter can
be used to inject a JavaScript code to
the href attribute of the next link the
following is the best way to do it as
soon as the user clicks on the link the
script will be triggered
we're going to press anything random and
now that we click next we can see the
xss level 5 that we had provided in the
URL as a parameter to the next
variable since the value of next
provided appears on a popup we can
consider the attack a success and move
on to the final level
six in this web application it shows
some of the external Javascript is
received if you analyze the URL you can
see that the script is loaded already
the vulnerability lies within how the
code handles the value after the
hashtag if you check on line L 45 the
value right after the hashtag is taken
as the gadget name and then in line
48 the value is directly passed on to
the include Gadget method and the
include Gadget method that we can see
over
here you can see in line
18 a script tag is created and the URL
Gadget name parameter value is directly
used as the source attribute of the
script tag in line 28
this means we can completely control the
source attribute of the script tag that
is being
created that is with this vulnerability
we can inject our own Javascript file
into the code we can inject a URL of our
own hosted JavaScript into the web
applications URL after the hashtag and
the URL should not be using https but
anything like that to bypass the regular
expression for security
checking going to remove the pre-stored
URL
and we're going to load our own
Javascript file
finally we have reached the end of our
challenge we completed six different
varieties of cross scripting attacks and
use different solutions for all of the
six questions with work from home being
the norm in today's era people spend
considerable amount of time on the
internet often without specific measures
to ensure a secure session apart from
individuals organizations worldwide that
host data and conduct business over the
internet are always at the risk of a Dos
attack these DS attacks are getting more
extreme with hackers getting easy access
to botet farms and compromise devices as
can be seen in the graph three of the
six strongest DDOS attacks were launched
in 2021 with the most extreme attack
occurring just last year in 2020 lately
cyber criminals have been actively
seeking out new services and protocols
for amplifying these DS attacks active
involvement with hacked machines and
botet allow further penetration into the
consumer space allowing much more
elaborate attack campaigns apart from
General users multinational corporations
have also had their fair share of
problems GitHub a platform for software
developers was the target of a DS attack
in 2018 widely suspected to be conducted
by Chinese authorities this attack went
on for about 20 minutes after which the
systems were brought into a stable
condition it was the strongest DS attack
to date at the time and made a a lot of
companies reconsider the security
practices to combat such attacks even
after years of experimentation tedos
attacks are still at large and can
affect anyone in the consumer and
corporate space hey everyone this is B
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video on what is a DS attack let's learn
more about what is a DS
attack a distributed denial of service
attack or dos is when an attacker or
attackers attempt to make it imp
possible for a service to be delivered
this can be achieved by thating access
to virtually anything servers devices
Services networks applications and even
specific transactions within
applications in a Dos attack it's one
system that is sending the malicious
data or requests a DS attack comes from
multiple systems generally these attacks
work by Drowning a system with requests
for data this could be sending a web
server so many requests to Ser a page
that it crashes under the demand or it
could be a database being hit with a
high volume of queries the result is
available internet bandwidth CPU and RAM
capacity become
overwhelmed the impact could range from
a minor annoyance from disrupted
services to experiencing entire websites
applications or even entire businesses
taking offline more often than not these
attacks are launched using machines in a
botnet a botnet is a network of devices
that can be triggered good to send
requests from a remote Source often
known as the command and control
center the bots in the network attack a
particular Target thereby hiding the
original perpetrator of the Dos campaign
but how do these devices come under a
botnet and what are the requests being
made to the web servers let's learn more
about these and how dos attack
work a Dos attack is a two-phase process
in the first phase a hacker creates a
botnet of devices simply put a vast
network of computers are hacked via
malware ransomware or just simple social
engineering these devices become a part
of the botn net which can be triggered
any time to start bombarding a system or
a server on the instruction of the
hacker that created the botn net the
devices in this networks are called Bots
or zombies in the second phase a
particular Target is selected for the
attack when the hacker finds the right
time to attack all the zomb IES in the
botnet network send these requests to
the Target thereby taking up all the
servers available bandwidth these can be
simple ping requests or complex attacks
like SN flooding and UDP flooding the
aim is to overwhelm them with more
traffic than the server or the network
can accommodate the goal is to render
the website or service
inoperable there's a lot of wiggle room
when it comes to the type of DS attack a
hacker can go with depending on the
target's vulnerability we can choose is
one of the three broad categories of Dos
attacks volume based attacks use massive
amounts of bogus traffic to overwhel a
resource it can be a website or a server
they include icmp udap and spoofed
packet flood attacks the size of volume
based attack is measured in bits per
second these attacks focus in clogging
all the available bandwidth for the
server thereby cutting the supply short
several requests are sent to the server
all of which warrant a reply thereby not
allowing the target to cater to the
general legitimate
users next we have the protocol level
attacks these attacks are meant to
consume essential resources of the
target server they exhaust the load
balancers and firewalls which are meant
to protect the system against the dors
attacks these protocol attacks include
SN floods and Smurf DDOS among others
and the size is measured in packets per
second for example in an s handshake
server replies to the Hello message sent
by the hacker which will be the client
in this case but since the IP is poofed
and leads nowhere the server gets stuck
in an endless loop of sending the
acknowledgement without any end in
sight finally we have the application
Level attacks application L attacks are
conducted by flooding applications with
maliciously crafted requests the size of
application layer attacks is measured in
request per second these are relatively
sophisticated attacks that Target the
application and operating system level
vulnerabilities they prevent the
specific applications from delivering
necessary information to users and hog
the network bandid up to the point of a
system crash examples of such an attack
are HTTP flooding and bgp hijacking a
single device can request data from a
server using HTTP post or get without
any
issues however when the requisite botnet
is instructed to bombard a server with
thousands of requests the database
bandwidth gets jammed and it eventually
becomes unresponsive and
unusable but what about the reasons for
such an attack there are multiple lines
of thought as to why a hacker decides to
launch a DS attack on unsuspecting tgas
let's take a look at a few of them the
first option is to gain a competitive
Advantage many ds attacks are conducted
by hacking communities against rival
groups some organizations hire such
communi ities to stagger their Rivals
resources at a network level to gain an
advantage in the playing field since
being a victim of a detour attack
indicates a lack of security the
reputation of such a company takes a
significant hit allowing the rivals to
cover up some
ground secondly some hackers launch
these DS attacks to hold multinational
corporations at Ransom the resources are
jammed and the only way to clear the way
is if the target company agrees to pay a
designated amount of money to to the
hackers even a few minutes of inactivity
is detrimental to a company's reputation
in the global market and it can cause a
spiral effect both in terms of market
value and product security index most of
the time a compromise is reached and the
resources are freed after a while DS
attacks have also found use in the
political segment certain activists tend
to use DS attacks to voice their opinion
spreading the word online is much faster
than any local Rally or for
primarily political these attacks also
focus on online communities ethical
dilemas or even protests against
corporations let's take a look at a few
ways that companies and individuals can
protect themselves against redos
attacks the company can employ load
balancers and firewalls to help protect
the data from such attacks load
balancers reroute the traffic from one
server to another in a DS attack this
reduces the single point of failure and
adds resiliency to the server data a
firewall blocks unwanted traffic into a
system and manages the number of
requests made at a definite rate it
checks for multiple attacks from a
single IP and occasional slowdowns to
detect a DS attack in
action early detection of a Doos attack
goes a long way in recovering the data
lost in such an event once you've
detected the attack you will have to
find a way to respond for example you
will have to work on dropping the
malicious DS traffic before it reaches
your server so that it doesn't throttle
and exhaust your bandwidth here's where
you will filter the traffic so that only
legitimate traffic reaches the server by
intelligent routing you can break the
remaining traffic into manageable chunks
that can be handled by your cluster
resources the most important stage in
DOS mitigation is where you will look
for patterns of Dos attacks and use
those to analyze and strengthen your
mitigation techniques for example
blocking an IP that's repeatedly found
to be offending is a first
step Cloud providers like Amazon web
services and Microsoft Azure who offer
high levels of cyber security including
firewalls and threat monitoring software
can help protect your assets and network
from DS criminals the cloud also has
greater bandwidth than most private
networks so it is likely to fail if
under the pressure of increased stos
attacks additionally reputable Cloud
providers offer Network redundancy to
duplicating copies of your data systems
and equipment so that if your service
becomes corrupted or unavailable due to
a Dos attack you can switch to a secure
access on backed up versions without
missing a beat one can also increase the
amount of bandwidth available to a host
server being targeted since DS attacks
fundamentally operate on the principle
of overwhelming systems with heavy
traffic simply provisioning extra
bandwidth to handle unexpected traffic
spikes can provide a measure of of
protection this solution can prove
expensive as a lot of that bandwidth is
going to go unused most of the
time a Content delivery Network or a CDN
distributes your content and boost
performance by minimizing the distance
between your resources and end users it
stores the cached version of your
content in multiple locations and this
eventually mitigates DS attacks by
avoiding a single point of failure when
the attacker is trying to focus on a
single Target popular CDN include acomi
CDN Cloud flare AWS cloudfront
Etc let's start with our demo regarding
the effects of DS attacks on a system
for our demo we have a single device
that will attack a Target making it a
Dos attack of sorts once a bot net is
ready multiple devices can do the same
and eventually emulate a DS attack to do
so we will use the virtualization
software called vmw with an instance of
parro security oper in system running
for a Target machine we will be running
another VMware instance of a standard
Linux distribution known as Linux light
in a Target device we can use wire shark
to determine when the attack begins and
see the effects of the attack
accordingly this is Linux light which is
a target machine and this is parro
security which is used by the hacker
when trying to launch a DS attack this
is just one of the dros that can be used
to launch the attack we must first find
the IP address of our
Target so to find the IP address we open
the
terminal we use the command if
config and here we can find the IP
address now remember we're launching
this attack in VMware now the both the
instances of parro security and Linux
light are being run on my local network
so the address that you can see here is
192.168
72129 which is a private address this IP
cannot be accessed from outside the
network basically anyone who is not
connected to my Wi-Fi when launching
attacks with public servers or public
addresses it will have a public IP
address that does not belong to the
192168
subnet once we have the IP address
we can use a tool
called hping
3 hping 3 is an open source packet
generator and analyzer for the TCP IP
protocol to check what are the effects
of an attack we will be using wire shark
wi shark is a network traffic analyzer
you can see whatever traffic that is
passing through the Linux light drro is
being displayed over here with the IPS
address the source IP and the
destination IP as to where the request
is being transferred to once we have the
Dos attack launched you can see the
results coming over here from The Source
IP which will be par security Now to
launch the hping 3 command we need to
give Pudo access to the console which is
the root
access now we have the root access for
the console the HP three command will
have a few arguments to go with it which
are as you can see on the
screen minus s and a
flood a hyphen
V hyphen p80 and the IP address of the
target which is 192 168
72129 in this command we have a few
arguments such as the minus s which
specifies syn packets like in an SSL
handshake we have the SN request that
the client sends to the server to
initiate a connection The Hyphen flood
aims to ignore the repliers that the
server will send back to the client in
response to the SN packets here the par
security OS is the client and Linux
slide being the
server minus v stands for verbosity as
in whereb we will see some output when
the requests are being sent the hyphen
p80 stands for Port 80 which we can
replace the port number if we want to
attack a different port and finally we
have the IP address of our
Target as of right now if we check wire
shock it is relatively clear and there
is no indication of a DS attack incoming
now once we launch the attack over
here we can see the coming in from this
IP which is 192 168
72128 till now even the network is
responsive and so is Linux
light the requests keep on coming and we
can see the
HTTP flooding has started in flood
mode after a few seconds of this attack
continuing the server will start
shutting down
now remember Linux light is a drro that
can focus on and that serves as a
backend now remember Linux light is a
drro and such Linux dros are served as
backend to many servers across the world
for example a few seconds have passed
from the attack now the system has
become completely irresponsive this has
happened due to the huge number of
request that came from par
security you can see whatever I press
nothing is responded even the Y shock
has stopped capturing new request
because the CPU usage right now is
completely 100% and at this point of
time anyone who is trying to request
some information from this Linux drro or
where this Linux drro is being used as a
backen for a server or a database cannot
access anything else the system has
completely stopped responding and any
request any legitimate request from
legitimate users will be
dropped once you stop the ATT back over
here it takes a bit of time to settle
down now remember it's still out of
control but eventually the traffic dies
down and the system regains its strength
it is relatively easy to gauge right now
the effect of a Dos attack now remember
this Linux light is just a VM instance
actual website servers and web databases
they have much more bandid and are very
secure and it is tough to break into
that is why we cannot use a single
machine ma to break into them that is
where a DS attack comes into play what
we did right now is a Dos attack as in a
single system is being used to penetrate
a Target server using a single request
now when a Dos attack multiple systems
such as multiple Pirro security
instances or multiple zombies or bots in
a botnet network can attack a Target
server to completely shut down the
machine and drop any legitimate request
thereby rendering the service and the
that Target completely unusable and
inoperable as a final note we would like
to remind that this is for educational
purposes only and we do not endorse any
attacks on any domains only test this on
servers and networks that you have
permission to test on cyber security has
become one of the most rigid Industries
in the last decade while simultaneously
being the most challenged with every
aspect of corporate culture going online
and embracing cloud computing the there
is a plethora of critical data
circulating through the internet all
worth billions of dollars to the right
person increasing benefits require more
complex attacks and one of these attacks
is a Brute Force attack a brute force or
known as Brute Force cracking is the
Cyber attack equivalent of trying every
key on your key ring and eventually
finding the right one Brute Force
attacks are simple and reliable there is
no prior knowledge needed about the
victim to start an attack most of the
systems following prey to Brute Force
attacks are actually well
secured attackers let a computer do the
work that is trying different
combinations of usernames and passwords
until they find the one that works due
to this repeated trial and error format
the strength of password matters a great
dral although with enough time and
resources brute force will break a
system since they run multiple
combinations until they find the right
passcode hey everyone this is B from
Simply learn and welcome to this video
on what is a Brute Force attack let's
let's begin with learning about Brute
Force attacks in
detail a Brute Force attack also known
as an exhaustive search is a
cryptographic hack that relies on
guessing possible combinations of
targeted password until the current
password is discovered it can be used to
break into online accounts encrypted
documents or even Network peripheral
devices the longer the password the more
combinations that will need to be tested
a Brute Force attack can be timec
consuming and difficult to perform if
methods such as data off fisc are used
and at times downright
impossible however if the password is
weak it could merely take seconds with
hardly any effort dictionary attacks are
an alternative to Brute Force attacks
where the attacker already has a list of
user names and passwords that need to be
tested against the target it doesn't
need to create any other combinations on
its own dictionary attacks are much more
reliable than brute force in a real
world context but the usefulness depends
entirely on the strength of passwords
being used by the general
population there is a three-step process
when it comes to brute forcing a system
let's learn about each of them in
detail in step one we have to settle on
a tool that we are going to use for
brute forcing there are some popular
names on the market like
hashcat Hydra and John the Ripper while
each of them has its own strength and
weaknesses each of them perform well
with the right configuration all of
these tools come pre-installed with
certain Linux distributions that cater
to penetration testers and cyber
security analyst like K Linux and parro
security after deciding what tool to use
we can start generating combinations of
alpha numeric variables whose only
limitation is the number of characters
for example while using Hydra a single
six digigit password will create 900,000
passwords with only digits involved add
Alpha and symbols to that sample space
and that numbers grows
exponentially the popular tools allow
customizing this process let's say the
hacker is aware of the password being a
specific eight-digit word containing
only letters and symbols this will
substantially increase the chances of
being able to guess the right password
since we remove the time taken to
generate the longer ones we omit the
need for including digits in such
combinations these small tweaks go a
long way in organizing an efficient
Force attack since running all the
combinations with no filters will
dramatically reduce the odds of finding
the right credentials in time in the
final step we run these combinations
against the file or service that is
being broken we can try and break into a
specific encrypted document a social
media account or even devices at home
that connect to the internet let's say
there is a Wi-Fi router the generated
passwords are then fed into the
connection one after the other it is a
long and arduous process but the work is
left to the computer other than someone
manually clicking and checking each of
these
passcodes any password that doesn't
unlock the router is discarded and The
Brute Force tool simply moves on to the
next one this keeps going on until we
find the right combination which unlocks
the
router sometimes reaching the success
stage takes days and weeks which makes
it combersome for people with low
computing power at their disposal
however the ability to crack any system
in the world purely due to bad password
habits is very appealing and the general
public tends to stick with simple and
easy to use
passwords now that we have a fair idea
about how Brute Force Works let's see if
we can answer this question we learned
about how complex passwords are tougher
to crack by Brute Force among the ones
listed on the screens which one do you
believe will take the longest to be
broken when using Brute Force tools
leave your answers in the comment
section and we will get back to you with
the correct option next
week let's move on to the harmful
effects of getting a system compromised
due to Brute Force
attacks a hack laptop or mobile can have
social media accounts logged in giving
the hackers free access to the victim's
connections it has been reported on
multiple occasions where compromised
Facebook accounts are sending malicious
links and attachments to people on their
friends
list one of the significant reasons for
hacking in malware infusion is best done
when spread from multiple devices
similar to Distributing spam this
reduces the chance of circling back the
source to a single device which belongs
to the hacker once brute forced A system
can spread malware via email attachments
sharing links file upload via FTP
Etc personal information such as credit
card data usage habits private images
and videos are all stored in our systems
be it in plane format or root for ERS a
compromised laptop means easy access to
these information that can be further
used to impersonate the victim regarding
Bank verification among other
things once a system is hacked it can
also be used as a mail server that
distributes spam across lists of victims
since the Hacked machines all have
different IP addresses and Mac addresses
it becomes challenging to trace the spam
back to the original hacker with so many
harmful implications arising from a boot
Force attack
it's imperative that the general public
must be protected against such let's
learn about some of the ways we can
prevent ourselves from becoming a victim
of Brute Force
attacks using passwords consisting of
alphabets letters and numbers have a
much higher chance of withstanding buil
Force attacks thanks to the sheer number
of combinations they can produce the
longer the password the less likely it
is that a hacker will devote the time
and resources to brute force them having
alpha numeric passwords also allows the
user to keep different passwords for
different websites this is to ensure
that if a single account or a password
is compromised due to a breach or a hack
the rest of the accounts are isolated
from the
incident two Factor authentication
involves receiving a one-time password
on a trusted device before a new login
is allowed this OTB can be obtained
either via email SMS or specific tofa
applications like Ai and agis email and
SMS based otps are considered relatively
less secure nowadays due to the ease
with which SIM cards can be duplicated
and mailboxes can be hacked applications
that are specifically made for TW course
are much more reliable and
secure captas are used to stop Bots from
running through web pages precisely to
prevent brute forcing through their
website since brot Force tools are
automated forcing the hacker to solve
capcha for every iteration of a password
manually is very challenging the capture
system can filter out these automated
Bots that keep refreshing the page with
different credentials thereby reducing
the chances of Brute Force
considerably a definite rule that locks
the account being hacked for 30 minutes
after a specific number of attempts is a
good way to prevent Brute Force attempts
many websites lock account for 30
minutes after three failed password
attempts to secure the account against
any such attack on an additional note
some websites also send an email
instructing the user that there have
been three insecure attempts to log into
the
website let's look at a demonstration of
how Brute Force attacks work in a real
world situation the world has gone
Wireless with 5i taking the re in every
household it's natural that the security
will always be up for debate to further
tou the security index and understand
Brute Force attacks you will attempt to
break into the password of a Wi-Fi
router for that to happen
we first need to capture a handshake
file which is a connection file from the
Wi-Fi router to a connecting device like
a mobile or a laptop the operating
system used for this process is parot
security a Linux distribution that is
catered to penetration testers all the
tools being used in this demo can easily
be found pre-installed in this operating
system if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply

description to know more
to start our demo we're going to use a
tool called airgeddon which is made to
hack into wireless network
specifically at this point it's going to
check for all the necessary scripts that
are installed in the
system to crack into a Wi-Fi and to
capture the handshake file we're going
to need an external network card
the significance of the external network
card is a managed mode and a monitor
mode for now the WL X1 named card is my
external network adapter which I'm going
to select to be able to capture data
over the air we're going to need to put
it in monitor mode as you can see above
it's written it is in managed mode right
now so we're going to select option two
which is to put the interface in monitor
mode and it name is now W l0 monitor
the monitor mode is necessary to capture
data over the air that is the necessary
reason why we need an external card
since a lot of inbuilt cards that come
with the laptops and the systems they
cannot have a monitor mode installed
once we select the mode we can go into
the fifth which is the handshake tools
menu in the first step we have to
explore for targets and it is written
that monitor mode is necessary to select
a Target so let's explore for
targets and press
enter we have to let this run for about
60 seconds to get a fair idea about the
networks that are currently working in
this locality for example this ESS ID is
supposed to be the Wi-Fi name that we
see when connecting to us Network go24
recover me these are all the names that
we see on our mobile when trying to
search for the Wi-Fi this BSS ID is
supposed to be an identifier somewhat
like a MAC address that identifies this
network from other devices the channels
features on one or two or there are some
many channels that the networks can
focus
on this here is supposed to be a client
that is connected to one such Network
for
example the station that you can see 56
26 this is supposed to be the MAC
address of the device that is connected
to to a router this BSS ID is supposed
to be which wi-fi it is connected to for
example 5895 d8 is this one which is the
go24 router so we already know which
router has a device connected to it and
we can use our attack to capture this
handshake now that we it has already run
for 1 minute now that we press contrl
C it will be asked to select a Target
see it has already selected the number
five which is the go24 router as the one
with clients so it is easy to run an
attack on and it is easy to capture a
handshake
for select Network 5 and we run a
capture
handshake it says we have a valid WPA
WPA2 Network Target selected and that
the script can
continue now to capture the handshake we
have a couple of attacks a do or a do
air replay attack what this attack does
is kick the clients out of the Network
in return when they try to reconnect to
the Wi-Fi as they are configured that
way that when a client is disconnected
it tries to reconnect it immediately it
tries to capture a handshake file which
in turn contains the security key which
is necessary to initiate the
handshake for our demo let's go with the
second option that is the do air replay
attack select a timeout value let's say
we give it 60
seconds and we start the script
we can see it capturing data from the
ge24 network and here we go we have the
WPA handshake
file once the handshake file is captured
can actually close this and here we go
congratulations in order to capturing a
handshake it has verified that a pmk ID
from the target network has successfully
been captured this is the file that is
already stored so do cap f for the path
we can let's say we can keep it in a
desktop okay we give the
path and the hand shap file is generated
we can already see a Target over here
same go24 router with the BSS
ID now if we return to its main
menu we already have the handshake file
captured with us now our job is to Brute
Force into that handshake capture file
the capture file is often encrypted with
with the security key of the Wi-Fi
network if we know how to decrypt it we
will automatically get the security key
so let's go to the offline WPA wp2
decrypt
menu since we'll be cracking personal
networks we can go with option
one now to run the Brute Force tool we
have two options either we can go with
the air crack or we can go with the
hashcat let's go with air ATT plus
crunch which is a Brute Force attack
against a handshake file we can go with
option
two it can already detect the capture
file that we have
generated so we select
yes the BSS ID is the one which denotes
the go24 router so we're going to select
yes as well the minimum length of the
key for example it has already checked
that the minimum length of a Wi-Fi
security key which is a WPA2 psk key
will always be more than eight digits
and Below 64 digits so we have to select
something in between this range so if we
already know let's say that the password
is at least 10 digits we can go with the
minimum length as 10 and as a rough
guess let's say we put the maximum
length as
20 the character set that we're going to
use for checking the password will
affect the time taken to Brute Force for
example if we already know that or we
have seen a user use the password while
connecting to the router as something
that has only numbers and symbols then
we can choose accordingly let's say if
we go with only uppercase characters and
numeric
characters go with option
seven and it's going to start
decrypting so how aircrack is working
right here you can see this passphrase
over here the first five or six digits
are a it starts working in way from the
end from the last character it keeps
trying every single combination you can
see the last the fourth character from
the right side the D it'll eventually
turn to
e because it keeps checking up every
single character from the end this will
keep going on until all the single
characters are tested and every single
combination is tried out since the
handshake file is encrypted using the
security key that is the WPA2 key of the
router whichever past phrase is able to
decrypt the handshake key completely
will be the key of the Wi-Fi router this
is the way we can Brute Force into Wi-Fi
routers anywhere in the world cyber
attacks are frequently making headlines
in today's digital environment at any
time everyone who uses a computer could
become a victim of a Cyber attack there
are various sorts of cyber attacks
ranging from fishing to password attacks
in this video we'll look into one such
attack that is known as B
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon never to miss an
update to begin with let's take a look
at some of the famous botet attacks the
first one is Mirai botet which is a
malicious program designed to attack
vulnerable iot devices and infect them
to form a network of bots that on
command perform basic and medium level
denial of service attacks then we have
the zoos bot specifically designed for
attacking the system for Bank related
information and data now let's see what
exactly a botnet
is botnet refers to a network of
hijacked interconnected devices that are
installed with malicious codes known as
malware each of these infected devices
are known as Bots and a hijack criminal
known as bot holder remotely controls
them the Bots are used to automate large
scale attacks including Data Theft
server pH
Mal
propagation and denial of service
attacks now that we know what exactly a
botet is let's dive deeper into learning
how bot net works during the preparation
of a botet network the first St involves
preparing the bot net Army after that
the connection between the bot net Army
and the control server established in
the end the launching of the attack is
done by the bot hter let's understand
through a
illustration firstly we have a bot Herer
that initiates the attack according to
the control server commands the devices
that are infected with the malware
programs and begins to attack the
infected system let's see some details
regarding the preparation of the bot net
Army the first step is known as the
prepping the bot net Army the first step
is creating a botet is to infect as many
as connected devices as possible this
ensures that there are enough Bots to
carry out the attack this way it creates
Bots either by exploiting the security
gaps in the software or websites or
using fishing attacks they are often
deployed through troan
horses for the next step we have
establishing the connection once it
hacks the device as per previous step it
infects it with the specific malware
that connects the device back to the
control bot server a bot Herer uses
command programming to drive the bot's
actions and the last step is known as
launching the attack once infected a bot
allows access to atmin level operation
like Gathering and stealing of data
reading and rewriting the system data
monitoring user activities performing
denial of service attacks including
other cyber
crimes now let's take a look at the B
architecture the first type is known as
CL Cent server model the client server
model is a traditional model that
operates with the help of a command and
control center server and communication
protocols like
IRC when the bot Herer issues a command
to the server it is then related to the
clients to perform malicious
actions then we have peer-to-peer model
here controlling the infected Bots
involves a peer-to-peer Network that
relies on a decentralized approach that
is the BS are topological inter
connected and acts as both CN C servers
that is the server and the client to the
hackers adopt this approach to avoid
detection and single point
failure in the end we will see some
points on some counter measure against
bot n
taxs the first step is to have updated
drivers and system updates after that we
should avoid clicking random popups or
links that we often see on the internet
and lastly
having certified antivirus anti-spyware
softwares and firewall installed into a
system will protect against malware
attack the internet is an endless source
of information and data still in some
cases we come across some occurrences
like cyber attacks hacking for entry
which may affect a Time on the web hi
everyone and welcome to the simply La
Channel today we will discuss a topic
that secretly records our input data
that is known as ke loggers but before
we We Begin if you like watching Tech
videos subscribe to our Channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an
update to understand the key logging
problem better let's take a look at an
example this is June she works in a
business firm where she manages the
company's data
regularly this is Jacob from the
information Department who is here to
inform her about some of the security
protocols during the briefing she
informed him about some of the problems
her system was facing with which
included slow reaction speed and unusual
internet
activity as Jacob heard about the
problems with the system he thinks of
the possibility what could be the reason
behind these problems a system was
facing
with the conclusion that he came across
was the key loging
issue unknown to the problem her system
was facing with she asked him about some
of the details regarding
it for today today's topic we learn what
exactly key loggers are and how they
affect our system what are the harmful
effects that key logging can bring into
the system to begin with we learn what
exactly the key logging program
is as a name suggest key logger is a
malicious program or a tool that is
designed to record key strokes that are
typed during data input and record them
into a lock file then the same program
secretly sends these lock files to its
origin
where they can be used for malicious
acts by the
hacker now that we know what the key
logging program is let's take a look how
they enter into the
system searching for a suitable driver
for a system can often lead to the
installation of the key logging program
into the system if we often visit
suspicious sites and uncertified
software are installed into our system
then if we use unknown links or visiting
unknown websites which come through
unknown addresses can also be a reason
behind the key logging issue entering
into the system and lastly there are
often cases where different popups that
we often see on social sites or
different media sites can lead to the
installation of key loging program into
our
system now that we know how the problem
gets into the system let's take a look
how to identify whether the system is
infected by the key logging issue
the key logging issue can be identified
if there are often cases when a keyboard
lags behind the system the data that we
enter sometimes is stck in between when
we type through the
input then there are cases when the
system freeze occurs unknowingly to what
exactly could be the reason behind them
and also there are delayed reaction time
for different applications that run on
the system and and lastly there are
different cases when we often see
suspicious internet activity on the
system that we don't know about this
could lead to the identification of a
problem into the
system now we'll take a look at
different types of key loggers that are
present on the net which can harm our
system
differently the first problem that key
loggers arous is API based the most
common key logging case which uses apis
to keep a log of the type data and share
it to its origin for malicious purposes
each time we press a key the key logger
intercepts the signal and logs it then
we have form grabbing based key loggers
as the name suggests they are a based
key loggers that store the form data
that is if we often use web forms or
different kinds of forms to enter
different data they can be recorded into
the system by the program and send it to
its
origin then we have kernel based key
loggers these key loggers are installed
deeply into the operating system where
they can hide from different antivirus
if not checked properly and they record
the data that we type on the keyboard
and send it to its
origin and lastly we have Hardware Key
lers these key loggers are present
directly into the hardware that is they
are embedded into system where they
record the data that we type on the
keyboard now let's take a look how
hackers differentiate different type of
recorded data and exploit
them when hackers receive information
about the target they might use it to
Blackmail the target which may affect
the personal life of the Target and also
blackmail them for different money
related
issues then in case of company data that
is recorded by the key logging program
can also affect the economic value of
the company in the market which may lead
to the downfall of the
company also in some cases the key
logging program can also log data about
military Secrets which may include
nuclear codes or security protocols
which are necessary to maintain the
security of a
country now let's take a look whether
mobile devices get infected with the key
log issue or
not in the case of hand devices
infection of key loggers are low Inc
comparision to the computer systems as
they use onscreen keyboard or virtual
keyboard but in some cases we often see
different kindes of malicious programs
getting installed into the hand device
if we often visit different uncertified
websites or illegal websites or torrent
sites and also the device Dev that is
infected with a key logging issue or
different kind of malicious program can
often lead to the exploitation of data
that includes photos emails or important
files by the hacker or the Cyber
criminal that install the particular
malicious program into the
system now to prevent our system from
getting infected by the key loging
program let's take a look at different
points the first point includes using of
different antivirus softwares or tools
which can prevent the entering a
malicious program into the
system then keeping system security
protocols regularly updated is also a
good
habit and lastly using virtual keyboard
to input our sensitive data which may
include Bank details login details or
different passwords related to different
websites now that we have some
understanding about the topic of key
loggers let's take a look at the demo to
further increase the knowledge about the
topic for the first step we have to
download some of the important libraries
that are required into the
system which
is this library now we'll run
it the system says the library is
already installed into the
system now let's take a look what
exactly modules are required from the
particular Library
from this Library we'll
import the keyboard module which will
help us to record the data that we type
on the
keyboard now from the same we'll also
import key
module and The Listener
module and
also the logging module which will help
us to record the data into a log
file for the next part we'll write a
piece of core that will allow us to save
the data that is recorded by the program
into a text file that will be named as
key log text file along with the date
and time stamp let's take a look
now we'll provide it with the file
name that will be given
as key log do txt
file and also so the part where the
format of the data is
recorded put the brackets over here to
contain the file name now we'll write
the format in which the data will be
recorded into the log file which will be
given
as the format would be the message and
the time stamp which would be given
as along with the time stamp
as
percentage and ending it with the
bracket now for the next step we'll
design two of the functions that will be
used into the program that will be
termed as while press function and while
release function let's take a look
while press
function would be a function that will
come into play when the keyboard key has
been
pressed
is
pressed
and this would go for the format that we
designed in the above
line
and
logging the Press
key
info a string file to be
recorded into the lock file
now now we'll design a function that is
while
release that will come into play
when the Escape key has been pressed
that is the program will terminate
itself self and the program will stop
from
running and in the
end we require for the functioning of
the program to Loop these functions that
is while press and while release to
continue it
cycle that will be going for while
press
and
on release will contain while
release
function
as listen
now and now this part would join the
different threads and store them into
the lock file now that we have completed
the code for the program let's run
it we have to wait for a moment so the
program runs it
now to verify the program let's open
notepad and on the notepad we'll write
hello
world which will be the basic whether
the program is working or not let's take
a
look and we'll go for the main page on
Jupiter notebook and refresh the page go
to the
bottom over here we see the key lock
text that is a text file that we created
let's open
it and over here we have the data that
is created as we started with Note then
this is the hello world part that we
created just
now which shows that the program we
created is working properly now that we
have reached the end of the module let's
take a look at the summary firstly we
learn what exactly key loggers are then
we understood what different modes are
present how the system get infected with
the key loging problem then we learned
how to detect the problem into our
system then we learn what different
types of key loggers are present on the
net we also understood how hackers use
the recorded data from the program and
we also learned whether mobile devices
get infected with the key logging
problem or not and lastly we understood
what different points can be taken to
prevent the entering of the key logging
problem into the system before we learn
about the Pegasus platform let us
understand what spyware is and it's
working spyware is a category of malware
that can gather information regarding a
user or a device straight from the host
machine it is mostly spread by malicious
links via email or chat applications
when a link with the malware is received
clicking on this link will activate the
spyware which allows the hacker to spy
on all our user information with some
spy systems even clicking on the link
isn't necessary to trigger the malicious
payload this can ultimately cause
security complications and further loss
of privacy
one such spyware system that is making
the rounds in the tech industry today is
Pegasus the Pegasus is a spyware system
developed by an Israeli company known as
the NSO group it runs on mainly mobile
devices spanning across the major
operating systems like the Apple's IOS
on iPhone and the standard Android
versions this is not a newly developed
platform since Pegasus has existed since
as early as 2016 a highly intricate spy
program that can track user location ret
text messages scan through mobile files
access device camera and microphone to
record voice and video Pegasus has all
the tools necessary to enforce
surveillance for any client that wishes
to buy its services initially the NSO
group had designed the software to be
used against terrorist factions of the
world with more and more encrypted
communication channels coming to the
Forefront Pegasus was designed to
maintain control over the data
transmission that can be a threat to
National Security unfortunately the
people who bought the software had
complete control over who how and up to
what level they can put surveillance
limits on eventually the primary clients
became Sovereign Nations spying on
Public Information that is supposed to
stay private became really easy with
this service multiple devices can be
affect With the same spy system to
create a network information this
network keeps feeding data to the host
to understand how a network can be
created let's know how a mobile device
can be affected by Pegasus
we all communicate with friends and
family over instant messaging
applications and email in some instances
if you check your inbox on a regular
basis you must have noticed that we
received some spam emails that the mail
providers like Gmail and Yahoo can just
filter into the spam folder some of
these messages bypass this filter and
make their way into a person's inbox
they look like generic emails which are
supposed to be safe the Pegasus pyware
targets such occurrences by passing
malicious messages and links which
install the necessary Spy software on
the user's mobile device be it Android
or an iPhone this isn't unique to the
email ecosystem since it's equally
likely to be targeted by SMS text
WhatsApp Instagram or even the most
secure messaging apps like signal and
threa once the malicious links are
clicked a spyware package is downloaded
and installed on the device after the
spyer is successfully installed the
perpetrator who sent the payload to the
victim can monitor everything the user
does Pegasus can collect private emails
passwords images videos and every other
piece of information that passes to the
device Network all this data is
transmitted back to the central server
where the primary spying organization
can monitor the activities at a granular
level this is not even surface level
since complex py software like Pegasus
can access the root files on our mobiles
these root files hold information that
is crucial to the working of the Android
and IOS operating systems leaking such
private information is a massive blow to
the security and the privacy of an
individual the information that may seem
trivial like the name of your Wi-Fi
connection or the last time you ordered
an item from Amazon are indeed all
valuable information this exploitation
is primarily possible due to the zero
day vulnerabilities known as bugs in the
software development process the zero de
bugs are the ones that have just been
discovered by some independent security
company or a researcher
once they are found reporting these
vulnerabilities to the developer of the
platform which would be either Google
for Android or Apple for iOS is the
right thing to do however many such
critical bugs make their way onto the
dark web where hackers can use them to
create exploits these exploits are then
sent to innocent users with a link or a
message like we had discussed before
Pegasus was able to affect the latest
devices with the all the security
patches installed but some bugs are not
reported to the developers or just
cannot be fixed without breaking some
core functionality these become the
Gateway for spyware to enter into the
system you can never be 100% safe but
you sure can give it all in protecting
yourself the one thing where Pegasus
stands out is a zero click action
feature usually in spam emails the
malicious code is activated when the
user clicks the malware link a user
doesn't need to click the link in the
new version of the Pegasus and a few
other spyware programs once the message
arrives in the inbox of WhatsApp Gmail
or any other chat applications the
spyware gets activated and everything
can be recorded and sent back to the
central server the primary issue with
being affected by spyware as a victim is
detection unlike Crypt Miners and
Trojans spying Services usually do not
demand many system resources which makes
them tough to detect after they have
been activated since many devices slow
down after a couple of years any kind of
Performance Set due to such spyware is
often attributed to poor software
longetivity by the users they do not
check meticulously for any other causes
that is causing the Slowdown when left
unchecked these devices can capture
voice and video from the mobile sensors
while keeping the owner in the dark
let's take a moment to check if we are
well aware of the causes of such attacks
how do users fall free to such spyware
programs a by installing untested
software B by clicking on the third
party links from email and messages C by
not keeping the apps and phones updated
or D all of the above let us know your
answers in the comment section below and
we will re the correct answer next week
but what about the unaffected devices
the vulnerable ones while we cannot be
certain of our security there are a few
things we can do to boost our device be
it against Pegasus or the next big sper
on the market let's say we are safe now
and we have the time to take the
necessary steps to prevent a spare
attack what are the things we can go for
a primary goal must always be to keep
our apps and the operating system
updated with the latest security patches
the vulnerabilities that the exploits
Target are often discovered by
developers from Google and apple which
send the security patches quickly this
can be done for individual apps as well
so keeping them updated is of utmost
importance while the most secure devices
have fallen pre to Pegasus as well a
security patch from developers may help
in minimizing the damage at a latest
page or maybe negate the entire spyware
platform alog together another big
factor is the spread of malware is the
trend of sideloading Android
applications using APK files downloading
such apps from a thirdparty website have
no security checks involved and are
mostly responsible for adware and
spyware invasions on user devices
avoiding the side loading of apps would
be a major step in protecting yourself
we often receive spam emails or texts
from people we may not know on social
medias the are accompanied with links
that allow malware to creep into our
device we should try to follow the
trusted websites and not click on any
links that redire us to unknown domains
spy is a controversial segment in
governance while the ramifications are
pretty extreme in theory it severely
impacts user privacy against
authoritarian regimes sufficient
resources and a contingent plan can
alter the false whale of democracy
altogether even if our daily life is
rather simplistic we must understand
that privacy is not about what we have
to hide instead it portrays the things
we have to protect it stands for
everything we have to share with the
outside world both theorically and
literally hey everyone today we look at
the hack which took the World by storm
and affected multiple governments and
corporations the solar winds attack the
global statistics indicate that upward
of 18,000 customers have been affected
potentially needing billions to recover
the losses incurred before we have a
look at this hack Make sure to subscribe

Bell to never miss an update from Simply
learn the date is December 8th 2020 fire
a global leader in company specializing
in cyber security released a blog post
that caught the attention of the entire
it Community a software known as Orion
which was developed by solar wi
Incorporated had become a victim of a
remote access Trojan or a rat the breach
was estimated to be running since the
spring of 2020 and went virtually
unnoticed for months the reveal sent the
developers of the Orion software into a
frenzy as they quickly released a couple
of hot fixes for their platform in order
to mitigate this threat and prevent
further damage but how did this come
into existence we first need to
understand the platform which was
responsible for this breach soloin a
software company based in Texas United
States had developed a management
platform known as Orion cering to
corporations and governments worldwide
oryan was responsible for the monitoring
and management of it Administration
this included managing the client
servers virtualization components and
even the organizations Network
infrastructure that bought the platform
solar wind claims they have more than
300,000 clients including US government
agencies and several Fortune 500
companies this entire chain can be
classified as a supply chain attack in
this variant of cyber crime the hackers
Target relatively weaker links in an
organizations chain of control and
delivery these are preferbly services
rendered by a third party since there is
no direct jurisdiction over it in this
case the Orion platform was the primary
target the culprit however was software
updates the update server for solarin
Orion had a malicious version attached
with malware or a Trojan to be precise
this was made possible since the code
repository that handled the software
updates was breached once the update
server repository was compromised the
source code of the applications became
open to modification and malicious code
found its way onto the software the
remote access troen was attached to a
potential update nicknamed the Sunburst
update this update gave hackers backdoor
access to any client that uses the
correct version on its release many
clients believed the update to be
legitimate since it came from the right
source and they had no reason to believe
otherwise American government agencies
were supposedly hit the hardest as the
list of victims included the US
Departments of Homeland Security
treasury and health several private
companies like Cisco Nvidia and Intel
were compromised according to to a list
published by the cyber security firm
trusk most of the companies had issued
quick updates to fix these
vulnerabilities introduced by the
software while the actual perpetrators
have never been found it is believed
that this was an act of crossborder
corporate Espionage conducted by state
sponsored hackers either from Russia or
China before we move forward let's take
a recap of the things we learned what
category of malware was responsible for
the solar wind hack was it one a virus a
remote ex estrogen a spyware or a worm
let us know your answers in the comment
section right away and we will reveal
the correct answer in a week coming to
possible reparations the Biden
government has launched a full
investigation on the effects and the
repercussions of this breach there are a
couple of things that we as consumers
must always tend to when working our way
through the worldwide web using a
password manager is highly recommended
which can generate secure alpha numeric
passwords you must also use different
passwords for different accounts thereby
reducing the chances of a single point
of failure should one of those accounts
get breached usage of two-factor
authentication applications is also
encouraged since it acts as a safety net
if hackers directly get a hold of our
credentials clicking on unknown links
transmitted via emails is also a strict
no as is installing applications from
unverified sources the solar winds hack
is estimated to cost the pent company
nearly $18 million as reparations making
it one if not the biggest hacks in cyber
I space history as recently as of July
2021 the hackers accessed some us
attorneys Microsoft 365 email accounts
as part of the attack criminal
organizations like the FBI and CIA are
determined to figure out the culprits
responsible for this debacle however the
intricacy and the full extent of the
breach makes it a way more complicated
job than it looks on paper the day is
26th February
2022 the world is hit with breaking news
that Russian State TV channel have been
hacked by Anonymous a activist
collective in movement who have made a
name taking part in multiple Cyber Wars
in the past decade this was in response
to the Russian aggression on Ukrainian
territory in the hopes of annexation
Anonymous hacked the Russian State TV
networks to combat propaganda in Russia
and highlight the damage to life Meed
out by the Kremlin in Ukraine they also
hacked 120,000 Russian troops personal
information and the Russian Central Bank
stealing 35,000 files this served as a
clear indicator of how cyber War can
change the momentum in battle something
which people had never seen so closely
so what is cyber War a digital assault
or series of strikes or hacks against a
country is sometimes referred to as a
cyber War it has the ability to cause
havoc on government and civilian
infrastructure as well as disrupted
essential systems causing State harm and
even death in this day and age the
internet plays a bigger role than just
watching watching videos and learning
content it's where you have your
personal data and carry Financial
transactions so rather than resorting to
physical violence cyber War has become
the new means to cause Havoc considering
the vulnerability of the data passing
through the internet in most
circumstances cyber warfare involves a
nation state attacking another in
certain cases the assaults are carried
out by terrorist organizations or
non-state actors pursuing a hostile
nation's aim in June 2021 Chinese
hackers targeted organizations like
Verizon to secure remote access to their
networks stuck net was a computer worm
designed to attack Iran's nuclear
facilities but evolved and expanded to
many other industrial and energy
producing sites in
2010 since the definition of cyber war
is so vague applying rules and sanctions
based on digital assault is even tougher
making the field of cyber warfare a
lawless land not bound by any rules or
policies there are multiple ways in
which these attacks can be carried out a
major category of Cyber attack is
espionage Espionage entails monitoring
other countries to steal critical
Secrets this might include compromising
vulnerable computer systems with botn
Nets or spear fishing attempts before
extracting sensitive data in cyber
warfare the next weapon in cyber war is
sabotage government agencies must
identify sensitive data and its dangers
if it is exploited Insider threats such
as disgruntled or irresponsible
Personnel or government staff with ties
to the attacking country can be used by
hostile countries or terrorists to steal
or destroy information by overwhelming a
website with bogus requests and forcing
it to handle them denial of service
attacks prohibit real users from
accessing it attacking parties may use
this form of assault to disrupt key
operations and systems and prevent
citizens military and security officials
and research organizations from
accessing sensitive websites but what
benefits does Cyber War offer in
contrast to traditional physical Warfare
the most important Advantage is the
ability to conduct attacks from anywhere
globally without having to travel
thousands of miles as long as the
attacker and Target are connected to the
internet organizing and launching Cyber
Wars is relatively less tedious Than
Physical Warfare people living in or
battling for a country are subjected to
propaganda attacks in an attempt to
manipulate their emotions and thoughts
digital infrastructure is highly crucial
in today's modern world starting from
communication channels to Secure Storage
servers crippling a country's footprint
and control on the Internet is very
damaging but what are some of the ways
we as Citizens protect ourselves in the
case of a cyber war in the unfortunate
event that your country is involved in
Warfare be sure to fact check every
piece of information and follow only
trusted sources in that frame of time
even conversations online should be
limited to a need to know basis
considering prop propaganda campaigns
have the power to influence the tide of
War drastically it is highly crucial to
follow basic security guidelines to
secure our devices like regularly
updating our operating systems
occasionally running full system
antivirus scans Etc if your country or
organization is being attacked having
devices segregated in a network goes a
long way in bolstering
security try to avoid sharing a lot of
personal data online in this era of
Instagram and Facebook
divulging private information can be
detrimental to keeping a secure firewall
for your data the more information an
attacker has access to the higher his
chances of being able to devise a plan
to infiltrate defenses in this video we
bring you the top 10 computer hacks of
all time but before we begin if you're
new here and haven't subscribed already

and the bell icon for interesting Tech
videos every day let's see what we have
at number 10 from April 27 2007 Estonia
the European country faced a series of
cyber attacks that lasted for weeks this
happened when the Estonian government
desired to move the bronze soldier from
Talent Center to a less prominent
military cemetery located on the city's
outskirts unprecedented levels of
internet traffic took down Estonian
Banks online services media Outlets
broadcasters and government bodies
botnet sent massive waves of spam and
vast amounts of automated Online
requests according to researchers the
public fac dos attacks there were
conflicts to edit the English language
version of The Bronze soldiers Wikipedia
page as well although there is no
confirmation Russia is believed to be
behind these cyber attacks that largely
crippled the Estonian Society let's now
move on to the next attack on December
23rd 2015 several parts of Ukraine
witnessed a par outage and this was not
a typical blackout it was indeed the
result of a Cyber attack information
systems of three energy distribution
companies in Ukraine were compromised it
is the first known Victorious Cyber
attack on a par grid it is said that
here hackers sent out fishing emails to
the par companies 30 substations were
Switched Off and about 230,000 people
were left in the dark for about 1 to 6
hours us investigators believed that
Russia based hackers were responsible
for this experts have want that other
countries could also be vulnerable to
such attacks let's see what we have at
number eight in the year 1999 a Cyber
attack caused a 21-day shutdown of NASA
computers unbelievable isn't it the
hacker was none other than the then
15-year-old Jonathan James he first
penetrated US Department of Defense
division's computers and installed a
back door on its servers this allowed
him to intercept more than a thousand
government emails including the ones
containing usernames and passwords this
helped James steal a piece of NASA
software and crack the NASA of computers
that support the International Space
Station which cost a space exploration
agency's
$41,000 as systems were shut down for 3
weeks he was the first person to carry
out a computer hack against the American
space agency let's now move on to the
next attack in late November 2014 there
was a leak of confidential data from the
film studio of Sony Pictures information
about Sony Pictures employees their
emails copies of the then unreleased
Sony films future positions and other
crucial data were leaked this Cyber
attack was carried out by a hacker group
named Guardians Of Peace so what did the
hackers want well they demanded that
Sony withdraw its then upcoming movie
the interview this movie was a comedy
story line to assassinate the North
Korean leader Kim jnun Sony then decided
to cancel the film's theatrical release
due to the threats at Cinema screening
the movie it is indeed hard to trace the
roots of a Cyber attack in this case
after evaluation the US intelligence
officials arrived at the theory that the
attack was in a way related to the
government of North Korea however North
Korea had denied the same moving on to
our number six in December 2006 TJX the
US retailer company identified that 45.6
million debit and credit card details
were
stolen this happened from one of its
systems over 18 months by an unknown
number of intruders it was one of the
first largest ever cyber attacks
involving the loss of personal data as a
banks in the affected regions had to
reissue and block thousands of payment
cards a group of hackers did this Albert
Gonzalez being The Mastermind the group
was from Miami the place where the TJX
Heist was believed to have originated
reports said that the TJX data breach
occurred because of weak web encryption
at two of its Marshall stores in Miami
next moving on to our top five let us
see what we have at number five the year
2010 witnessed the discovery of the
deadly computer worm stuck net this
Mal's motive was unlike any other usual
cyber attacks it aimed at destructing
the equipment the computers controlled
stuck net came with the deadly purpose
of damaging Iran's nuclear
infrastructure it infected more than
200,000 computers including 14
Industrial sites and a uranium
enrichment plant in Iran stet initially
spread via Microsoft Windows and
targeted seamen industrial control
systems although it was discovered only
in 2010 It is believed to have been
silently sabotaging Iran's nuclear
facilities it was one of the first
discovered malware that was capable of
hampering hardware systems it largely
damaged the centrifuges of the Iranian
reactors this is believed to be a cyber
weapon created by the US and the Israeli
intelligence although there is no
documented evidence or acceptance by
either of the countries for the same
moving on to number four in the year
2014 Home Depot was is the victim of one
of the deadliest cyber attacks 56
million payment cards were compromised
along with 53 million customer email
addresses stolen this security breach
happened from April to September 2014
criminals were believed to have used a
third party wendor username and password
to enter the perimeter of Home Depot's
Network the attackers were then able to
deploy custom built malware on its self
checkout systems in the US and Canada
moving on to our top three
as you might be aware the PlayStation
gaming system is one of Sony's most
popular products unfortunately in April
2011 Sony Executives witnessed abnormal
activity on the PlayStation Network this
resulted in the compromise of
approximately 77 million PlayStation
users accounts and prevented users of
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable
consoles from accessing the service this
forced Sony to turn off the PlayStation
Network on April 20th on May 4th both
Sony confirmed that personally
identifiable information from each of
the 77 million accounts had been exposed
the outage lasted for 23 days Sony
released almost daily announcements
concerning the system outage in the end
Sony is believed to have invested
approximately $170 million to improve
the network security to investigate the
attack and to cover the expenses of
caring for the consumers that had been
affected let's now move on to the next
attack at number two in May 2017 one of
the most dangerous cyber attacks took
place it was known as The wner Cry
ransomware attack caused by the warry
crypto worm the victims were the users
that used the unsupported version of
Microsoft Windows and those who hadn't
installed the new security update this
did not take place through fishing like
other attacks but through an exposed
vulnerable SMB Port the attack
originated in Asia and then eventually
spread across the globe in a day more
than 200,000 computers were infected
across 150
countries the W cry Cryptor locked the
users out of the targeted systems and
encrypted their data the users were
asked for a ransom of $300 to $600 which
had to be paid via Bitcoin in exchange
for their data this attack took a toll
on both private and government
organizations it resulted in Damages
from hundreds of millions to billions of
dollars in a matter of few days the
emergency patches released by Microsoft
halted the attack also the discovery of
a kill switch prevented the infected
computers from spreading the crypto worm
Security Experts and a few countries
believed that North Korea was behind
this attack and finally let's see what
we have at number one more than two
decades ago in March 1999 the Melissa
virus a mass mailing macro virus was
released it targeted Microsoft Word and
Outlook based systems and created
considerable Network traffic Melissa
virus infected computers via emails the
email would look like an important
message well yes it was fake if the
recipient opens the attachments in the
mail and downloads the document and then
opens it with Microsoft Word a virus was
released on their
computers this would then massmail
itself to the first 50 people in the
victim's contact list and then disable
multiple Safeguard features on Microsoft
Word and Microsoft Outlook this began
spreading like a wildfire across the
internet David El Smith released the
virus the virus cost nearly 80 million
worth of Damages it did not steal data
or money however it costed a Havoc
almost 1 million email accounts were
disrupted worldwide agencies were
overloaded and some had to be shut down
entirely and internet traffic in some
locations was slowed down security was
traditionally considered an afterthought
in softare develop it is becoming an
increasingly important concern for all
aspects of app development from design
to deployment and Beyond the number of
programs produced distributed deployed
and patched across Network continually
increases as a result application
security features must deal with a wide
range of risks let's take an example a
malicious script may be mirrored on the
victim's web browser or kept in a
database and run whenever the user
contacts the proper function depending
on the kind of attack in question here
this allows malicious code to be entered
in the case of an output the major cause
of this attack is faulty user input
validation which allows malicious input
to enter the final output an evil user
can enter a script that will be injected
into the website's code the browser will
then be unable to determine whether the
process code is harmful as a result a
malicious script is performed on the
victim's browser or a bogus form is
shown to the users are you aware of
which attack this is if not do stay till
the end to find the correct answer are
you aware of which attack this
if not please stay till the end of the
video to know the correct answer hey
everyone welcome to today's video on
application security before we move
forward subscribe to our Channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
from us let's take a look at the topics
to be covered today we start by learning
about application security and its
different types we learn about the most
common vulnerabilities in apps followed
by the importance of application
Security in today's cyber security space
next we cover some attacks against
application layer security and end the
video with some protection techniques to
enforce application security parameters
so let's start by learning about
application security from a Grassroots
perspective application security which
is often known as appet protects
application software from external
security threats by utilizing security
software Hardware methodologies best
practices and different processes
organizations require application
security technologies that Safeguard all
of their programs from internal to
popular external apps on consumer mobile
phones these Solutions must address the
whole development cycle and provide
testing after an application has been
deployed to detect possible issues
application security mechanism must
capable of testing web pages for
possible and exploitable vulnerabilities
analyzing code and assisting in the
administration of development and Safety
Management processes the testing
Solutions must also be simple and easy
to install for system administrators
worldwide consumers utilize hundreds of
applications daily to access
theoretically important and favored
services such as e-commerce banking
music Etc to be productive these
professionals use a variety of software
Solutions as well ranging from online
word Checkers to tablet based creative
tools among other things backend
software of course exists to automate
essential operations and processes and
decreases human labor but to make
matters worse the quantity and
complexity of these apps and their
backend code is increasing the software
security problem 10 years ago was about
securing desktop apps and static web
pages that were natively harmless and
easy to scale through and
defend because of Outsource development
the number of Legacy programs and
in-house development that uses
third-party open source and
commercialized of the Shelf software
modules the software supply chain has
become considerably more convoluted
now that we understand application
Security on a general level let us go
through some of the different categories
or the types of application security the
three major types to be covered in this
section web application security API
security and Cloud native application
security a web application is a program
available through the internet and it
operates on a web server the client is
accessed using a web browser the
applications by definition must allow
connections from clients across
unsecured Network this exposes them to a
variety of risks many online apps are
mission critical and include sensitive
customer data making them an attractive
Target for attackers and a top concern
for any cyber security program or
framework the Advent of https which
offers an encrypted channel of
communication Gods versus man in the
middle attacks or mitm attacks has
addressed several online application
weaknesses many weaknesses though still
persist many security providers have
created Solutions specifically geared to
safeguard online applications in
response to the rising challenge of web
application security a web application
firewall is an example of a security
technology meant to identify and prevent
application layer sols in the case of
web
applications when it comes to apis apis
that have security flaws are the root of
many major data breaches they have the
potential to reveal sensitive data and
disrupt vital corporate processes API
security flaws include insufficient
authentication unintended data
disclosure and a failure to apply rate
restriction which allows API abuse the
requirement for API security like the
necessity for web application security
has led to the creation of sophisticated
equipment that can discover API
vulnerabilities and protect apis in
production level the third type is cloud
native application security
infrastructure and environments are
often built up automatically in Cloud
native apps depending on declarative
configuration which is known as
infrastructure as code or IAC developers
are tasked to developing declarative
settings and application code both of
which should be secure because
practically everything is defined during
the development stage shifting left is
even more crucial in Cloud native setups
traditional testing techniques can help
Cloud native apps but they are
insufficient dedicated Cloud native
Security Solutions are mandatory at this
point of time which are capable of
instrumenting w Sal container clusters
and serverless operations reporting on
security concerns and providing
developers with a quick feedback loop
now that you have covered the different
types of application security let us go
through some of the most common
vulnerabilities that these Frameworks
face on a daily basis first is
cryptographic failure when data is not
adequately safeguarded in transit and at
rest cryptographic failures which are
forly known as sensitive data exposures
occur it has the potential to reveal
credentials health information credit
card details and personal information as
well depending on the type of data being
protected in that particular case
injection attacks C actors can use
injection vulnerabilities to convey
malicious information to a web
application interpreter it has the
potential to assemble and execute this
data on the server SQL injection is a
popular type of injection which I've
already covered in an introduction for
this
video another major vulnerability are
outdated components vulnerable and out
ofd components Encompass any
vulnerability caused by obsolete or
unmaintained software it can happen if
you construct or even use an application
without first learning about its core
components and
versions authentication failures
identification and authentication
failure which are previously known as
broken authentication enass any security
issue involving user identities identity
attacks and exploitation may be avoided
by implementing secure session
Administration authentication and
validation for all identities in the
organization in the next section let us
cover some of the protection mechanisms
employed by cyber security firms and
thirdparty automated software to prevent
the application layer from being
bombarded with SQL injections and other
attack the first is a web application
firewall or
WF a web application firewall monitors
and filters http traffic between a web
application and the worldwide web web
application firewall architecture does
not address all risks but it may be used
in conjunction with other defense
mechanisms it can be used with the
portfolio of Security Solutions to
provide a comprehensive defense against
diverse attack Roes it is a protocol
layer 7 protection in the open systems
interconnection or the OSI model
Paradigm that helps defend online
application against attacks such as
cross-site scripting cross side fraud
escap injection and file
intrusion unlike a proxy server which
conceals the identity of client
computers by an intermediary a w
functions as a reverse proxy shielding
the server from exposure it acts as a
barrier in front of a web application
protecting it from the internet the
clients must pass through the web
application firewall before they can
access the
application the second is threat
assessment a list of sensitive assets to
safeguard will assist you in
understanding the threat to your firm
and how to minimize them considering how
a hacker can infiltrate an application
if existing security protections are in
place and whether additional tools or
defense capabilities are required it's
also crucial to keep your security
expectations in check nothing is
impenetrable even with the most
stringent security measures it would be
best if you were realistic about what
you believe your team can handle in the
long ter when pushed to aggressively
safety regulations and procedures might
be disregarded
remember that safety is a lengthy and
time-taking project that requires the
collaboration of other employees and
sometimes even your customers the next
topic is privilege management limiting
privileges is vital especially for
Mission critical and sensitive systems
the least privileged principle states
that access to programs and data should
be limited to those who require them
when they require them for two reasons
the least privilege principle is
absolutely
critical the first is that hackers May
compromise less privileged accounts and
ensuring they do not acquire access to
highly sensitive systems is
critical the second is that internal
ders are equally harmful as external
adversaries if insiders go bad it's
critical to ensure they never have more
power than they need minimizing the harm
that they may be able to cause to the
organization network security is a set
of technologies that protects the
usability and integrity of a company's
infrastructure by preventing the entry
or proliferation within a network it
architecture comprises of tools that
protect the network itself and the
applications that run over it effective
network security strategies employ
multiple lines of defense that are
scalable and automated each defensive
layer here enforces a set of security
policies which are determined by the
administrator beforehand this aims at
securing the confidentiality and
accessibility of the data and the
network the every company or
organization that hand handles a large
amount of data has a degree of solutions
against many cyber threats the most
basic example of network security is
password protection it has the network
the user chooses so recently network
security has become the central topic of
cyber security with many organizations
involving applications from people with
skills in this area it is crucial for
both personal and professional networks
most houses with high speed internet
have one or more wireless routers which
can be vulnerable to attacks if they're
not adequately secured
data loss theft and sabotage risk may be
decreased with the usage of a strong
network security system the workstations
are protected from hazardous FW thanks
to network security additionally it
guarantees the security of the data
which is being shared over a network by
dividing information into various
sections encrypting these portions and
transferring them over separate Pathways
network security infrastructure offers
multiple levels of protection to th man
in the middle attack
preventing situations like eavesdropping
among other harmful attacks it is
becoming increasingly difficult in
today's hyperconnected environment as
more corporate applications migrate to
both public and private clocks
additionally modern applications are
also frequently virtualized and
dispersed across several locations some
outside the physical control of the IT
team Network traffic and infrastructure
must be protected in these cases since
assaults on businesses are increasing
every single day we now understood the
basics of network security but we need
to understand how network security works
in the next section in slightly more
detail network security revolves around
two processes authentication and
authorization the first process which is
authentication is similar to access
cards which ensure that only those have
the right to enter a building in other
words authentication checks and verifies
that it is indeed the user belonging to
the network who is trying to access or
enter it thereby preventing unauthorized
intrusions next comes
authorization this process decides the
level of access provided to the recently
authenticated
user for example Network admin needs
access to the entire network whereas
those working with the net probably need
access to only certain areas within the
network based on the network users role
the process of determining the level of
access or permission level is known as
authorization today's Network
architecture is complex and faces a
threat environment that is always
changing and attackers that are always
trying to find and exploit
vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities
can exist in many areas including
devices data applications users and
locations for this reason many Network
Security Management tools and
applications are in use today that
address individual
threats when it just a few minutes of
downtime can cause widespread disruption
and massive damage to an organization's
bottom line and reputation
it is essential that these protection
measures are in place
beforehand now that you know a little
about network security and its working
let's cover to the different types of
network
security the fundamental tenant of
network security is the layering of
protection for massive networks and
store data that ensure the acceptance of
rules and regulations as a whole there
are three types the first of which is
physical security the next being
Technical and the third being
administrative
let's look into physical security first
this is the most basic level that
includes protecting data and network to
unauthorized Personnel from acquiring
control over the confidentiality of the
network this include external
peripherals and routers that might be
used for cable connections the same can
be achieved by using devices like
biometric systems physical security is
critical especially for small businesses
that do not have many resources to
devote the security personnel and the
tools as opposed to large firms
when it comes to technical network
security it focuses mostly on
safeguarding data either kept in the
network or engaged in network
transitions this kind fulfills two
functions one is defense against
unauthorized users the other is a
defense against mevolent
actions the last category is
Administrative this level of network
security protects user Behavior like how
the permission has been granted and how
the authorization process takes place
this also ensures that the level of
sophistication the network might need to
protect it through all the attacks this
level also suggests necessary amendments
that have to be done to the
infrastructure I think that's all the
basics that we need to cover on network
security in which our next topic we're
going to go through two mediums of
network security which are the transport
layer and the application
layer so transport layer is a way to
secure information as it is carried over
the Internet with users browsing
websites emails instant messaging ET ET
TLS aims to provide a private and secure
connection between a web browser and a
website server it does this with the
cryptographic handshake between two
systems using public key cryptography
the two parties through the connection
exchange a secret token and once each
machine validates this token it is used
for all Communications the connection
employs lighter symmetric cryptography
to save bandwidth and processing power
since the application layer is the
closest layer to the end user it Prov
provides hackers with the largest threat
surface poor app player security can
lead to Performance and stability issues
data theft and in some cases the network
being taken down examples of application
layer attacks include distributed denal
service attacks or DDOS attacks HTTP
floods hql injections cross-site
scripting Etc most organizations have an
arsenal of application layer security
protections to combat these and more
such as web application firewalls secure
web gate with Services Etc now that we
have the theory behind network security
has been covered in detail let us go
through some of the tools that can be
used to enforce these network security
policies the first tool to be covered in
the section is a firewor a fireball is a
type of network security device that
keeps track of incoming and outgoing
Network traffic and it decides which
traffic to allow or deny in accordance
to a set of security rules for more than
25 years 5S have served as Network
Security's first line of defense they
provide a barrier between trustworthy
internal protected and regulated
networks from Shady external networks
like the internet at some
point the next tool which can be used to
bolster network security is a virtual
private Network or VPN for short it's an
encrypted connection between a device
and a network via the Internet the ened
connection AIDS the secure transmission
of sensitive data it makes it impossible
for unauthorized parties to e stop on
the traffic and enables remote work for
the user the usage of VPN technology is
common in both corporate and personal
networks next we cover the importance of
intrusion prision systems in network
security or IPS Frameworks an intrusion
prevention system is a network security
tool that continually scans a network
for harmful activity and responds to it
when it does occur by reporting blocking
or discarding it it can be either
Hardware or software it's more
sophisticated than an intuition
detection system or an IDs framework
which can just warn an administrator and
merely identify harmful activities while
in the case of an IPS it actually takes
against that activity the next tool in
this section and the final one are going
to be behavioral analytics behavioral
analytics focus more on the statistics
that are being carried over and stored
through months and years of usage on
some kind of similar pattern is noted
whe the it administrator can detect some
kind of attack the similar attacks can
be stopped and the security can be
further
enhanced now that we have covered all
that we need to know about network
security the necessary tools it's
different types Etc let's go to the
benefits of network security as a
whole the first which is protection
against external threats the objective
for cyber assaults can be as varied as
the Defenders themselves although
they're typically initiated for
financial gain whether they are
industrial spies activists or cyber
Criminal
these Bad actors all have one thing in
common which is how quick clever and
covert the attacks are getting a strong
cyber security posture that considers
routine software updates May assist
firms in identifying and responding to
the abuse techniques tools and the
common entry
points the next benefit is protection
against internal threats the human
aspect continues to be the cyber
security systems weakest link Insider
risk can originate from current or
former workers third party vendors or
even trusted partners and they can be
unintentional careless or downright even
aside from that the rapid expansion of
remote work and the personal devices
used for business purposes while even
iot devices in remote locations can make
it easier for these kind of threats to
go undetected until it's too late
however by proactively monitoring
networks and managing access these
dangers may be identified and dealt with
before they become expensive
disasters the third benefit is increased
productivity it is nearly impossible for
employees to function when networks and
personal devices are slow to a crawl by
viruses and other cyber attacks during
the operation of website and for the
company to run you may significantly
minimize violations and the amount of
downtime required to fix the breach by
implementing various cyber security
measures such as enhanced firewalls
virus scanning and automatic backups
employee identification of possible
email fishing schemes suspicious links
and other malicious criminal activities
can also be aided by Education and
Training another benefit is brand trust
and
reputation customer retention is one of
the most crucial elements in business
development customers today place a
premium on maintaining brand loyalty
through a strong cyber security stance
since as this is the fastest way to get
other businesses back get referrals and
sell more tickets overall additionally
it helps manufacturers get on the vendor
list with bigger companies as a part of
the supply chain which is only as strong
as its weakest link this opens
possibilities for potential future
endeavors and development with the rise
in censorship and general fear over
privacy loss consumer security is at an
all-time high risk technology has made
our life so much easier while putting up
a decent Target on our personal
information it is necessary to
understand how to simultaneously
Safeguard our data and be up to date
with the latest technological
developments maintaining this balance
has become easier with cryptography
taking its place in today's digital
world so hey everyone this is B from
Simply learn and welcome to this video
on cryptography but before we begin if
you love watching Tech videos subscribe
to our Channel and hit the Bell icon to
never miss an update from Simply learn
so here's a story to help you understand
cryptography meet an an wanted to look
for a decent discount on the latest
iPhone she started searching on the
internet and found a rather Shady
website that offered a 50% discount on
the first purchase once an submitted her
payment details a huge chunk of money
was withdrawn from a bank account just
moments after devastated and quickly
realized she had failed to notice that
the website was a HTTP web page instead
of an https one the payment information
submitted was not encrypted and it was
visible to anyone keeping an eye
including the website owner and hackers
had she used a reputed website which has
encrypted transactions and employees
cryptography our iPhone Enthusiast could
have avoided this particular incident
this is why it's never recommended to
visit unknown websites or share any
personal information on them now that we
understand why cryptography is so
important let's take a look at the
topics to be covered today we take a
look into what cryptography is and how
it works we learn where cryptography is
being used in our daily lives and how we
are benefit fitting from it then we will
understand the different types of
cryptography and their respective uses
moving on we will look at the usage of
cryptography in ancient history and a
live demonstration of cryptography and
encryption in action let's Now
understand what cryptography
is cryptography is the science of
encrypting or decrypting information to
prevent unauthorized access we transform
our data and personal information so
that only the correct recipient can
understand the message as an essential
aspect of modern data security using
cryptography allows the Secure Storage
and transmission of data between willing
parties encryption is a primary route
for employing cryptography by adding
certain algorithms to Jumble up the data
decryption is the process of reversing
the work done by encrypting information
so that the data becomes readable again
both of these methods form the basis of
cryptography for example when simply
learn is jumbled up or changed in any
format not many people can guess the
original word by looking at the
encrypted text the only ones who can are
the people who know how to decrypt the
coded word thereby reversing the process
of
encryption any data pre- encryption is
called plain text or clear text to
encrypt the message we use certain
algorithms that serve a single purpose
of scrambling the data to make them
unreadable without the necessary tools
these algorithms are called ciphers they
are a set of detailed steps to be
carried out one after the other to make
sure the data becomes as unreadable as
possible until it reaches the receiver
we take the plain text pass it to the
cipher algorithm and get the encrypted
data this encrypted text is called the
cipher text and this is the message that
is transferred between the two parties
the key that is being used to scramble
the data is known as the encryption key
the these steps that is the cipher and
the encryption key are made known to the
receiver who can then reverse the
encryption on receiving the message
unless any third party manages to find
out both the algorithm and the secret
key that is being used they cannot
decrypt the messages since both of them
are necessary to unlock the hidden
content wonder what else we would lose
if not for
cryptography any website where you have
an account can read your passwords
import important emails can be
intercepted and their contents can be
read without encryption during the
transit more than 65 billion messages
are sent on WhatsApp every day all of
which are secured thanks to endtoend
encryption there is a huge Market
opening up for crypto currency which is
possible due to blockchain technology
that uses encryption algorithms and
hashing functions to ensure that the
data is secure if this is of particular
interest to you you can watch our video
on blockchain the link of which will be
the description of course there is no
single solution to a problem as diverse
as explained there are three variants of
how cryptography works and is in
practice they are symmetric encryption
asymmetric
encryption and hashing let's find out
how much we have understood until now do
you remember the difference between a
cipher and Cipher text leave your
answers in the comments and before we
proceed if you find this video
interesting make sure to give it a
thumbs up before moving ahead let's look
at symmetric encryption
first symmetric encryption uses a single
key for both the encryption and
decryption of data it is comparatively
less secure than asymmetric encryption
but much faster it is a compromise that
has to be embraced in order to deliver
data as fast as possible without living
information completely vulnerable this
type of encryption is used when data
rests on servers and identify I
Personnel for payment applications and
services the potential drawback with
symmetric encryption is that both the
sender and receiver need to have the
same secret key and it should be kept
hidden at all times Caesar Cipher Enigma
machine are both symmetric encryption
examples that we will look into further
for example if Alice wants to send a
message to Bob she can apply a
substitution Cipher or a shift Cipher to
encrypt the message but Bob must be
aware of the same key itself self so he
can decrypt it when he finds it
necessary to read the entire message
symmetric encryption uses one of the two
types of ciphers stream ciphers and
block ciphers block ciphers break the
plain text into blocks of fixed size and
use the key to convert it into Cipher
text stream ciphers convert the plain
text into Cipher text one bit at a time
instead of resorting to breaking them up
into bigger chunks in today's world the
most widely used symmetric encryption
algorithm is AES 256 that stands for
advanced encryption standard which has a
key size of 256 bit with 128bit and 196
bit key sizes also being available other
primitive algorithms like the data
encryption standard that is the dees the
triple data encryption standard 3des and
Blowfish have all fallen out of favor
due to the rise of AES AES chops UPS the
data into blocks and performs 10 plus
rounds of obs securing and substituting
the message to make it
unreadable asymmetric encryption on the
other hand has a double whammy at its
disposal there are two different keys at
play here a public key and a private key
the public key is used to encrypt
information pre-transit and a private
key is used to decrypt the information
post Transit if Alice wants to
communicate with Bob using asymmetric
encryption she encrypts the message
using Bob's public key after receiving
the message Bob uses his own private key
to decrypt the data this way nobody can
intercept the message in between
transmissions and there is no need for
any secure key exchange for this to work
since the encryption is done with the
public key and the decryption is done
with the private key that no one except
Bob has access to both the keys are
necessary to read the full
message there is also a reverse scenario
where we can use the private key for
encryption and the public key for
decryption a server can sign
non-confidential information using its
private key and anyone who has its
public key can decrypt the message this
mechanism also proves that the sender is
authenticated and there is no problem
with the origin of the
information RSA encryption is the most
widely used asymmetric encryption
standard it is named after its Founders
reest Shamir and Edelman and it uses
block ciphers that separate the data
into blocks and obscure the information
widely considered the most secure form
of encryption albeit relatively slower
than AES it is widely used in web
browsing secure identification VPN
emails and chat
applications with so much hanging on the
key secrecy there must be a way to
transmit the keys without others reading
our private data many systems use a
combination of symmetric encryption and
asymmetric encryption to bolster
security and match speed at the same
time
since asymmetric encryption takes longer
to decrypt large amounts of data the
full information is encrypted using a
single key that is symmetric encryption
that single key is then transmitted to
the receiver using asymmetric encryption
so you don't have to compromise either
way another route is using the Diffy
helpman key exchange which relies on a
one-way function and is much tougher to
break into the third variant of
cryptography is termed as hashing
hashing is the process of scrambling a
piece of data beyond recognition it
gives an output of fixed size which is
known as the hash value of the original
data or just hash in general the
calculations that do the job of messing
up the data collection form the hash
function they are generally not
reversible without resilient Brute Force
mechanisms and are very helpful when
storing data on website servers that
need not be stored in Blain text for
example many websites store your account
par wordss in a hashed format so that
not even the administrator can read your
credentials when a user tries to log in
they can compare the entered passwords
hash value with the hash value that is
already stored on the servers for
authentication since the function will
always return the same value for the
same
input cryptography has been in practice
for centuries Julius Caesar used a
substitution shift to move alphabets a
certain number of spaces beyond their
place in the alphabet table
a spy can't decipher the original
message at first glance for example if
he wanted to pass confidential
information to his armies and decides to
use the substitution shift of plus two a
becomes c b becomes D and so on the word
attack when passed through a
substitution shift of plus three becomes
dww dfn this Cipher has been
appropriately named the Caesar Cipher
which is one of the most widely used
algorithms
the Enigma is probably the most famous
cryptographic Cipher device used in
ancient history it was used by the Nazi
German armies in the world wars they
were used to protect confidential
political military and administrative
information and it consisted of three or
more rotors that scrambled the original
message depending on the machine State
at that time the decryption is similar
but it needs both machines to stay in
the same state before passing the cipher
text so that so that we receive the same
plane text message let's take a look at
how our data is protected while we
browse the internet thanks to
cryptography here we have a webbased
tool that will help us understand the
process of RSA encryption we see the
entire workflow from selecting the key
size to be used until the decryption of
the cipher text in order to get the
plain text back as we already know RSA
encryption algorithm falls under the
umbrella of asymmetry key
cryptography that basically implies that
we have two keys at play here a public
key and a private
key typically the public key is used by
the sender to enp the message and the
private key is used by the receiver to
deip the message there are some
occasions when this allocation is
reversed and we will have a look at them
as well in RSA we have the choice of key
size we can select any key from a 512
bit to 1024-bit all the way up to a 496
bit key the longer the key length the
more complex the encryption process
becomes and thereby strengthening the
cipher text although with added security
more complex functions take longer to
perform the same operations on similar
size of data we have to keep a balance
between both speed and strength because
the strongest encryption algorithms are
of no use if they cannot be practically
deployed in systems around the world
let's take a24 bit key over here now we
need to generate the keys this
generation is done by functions that
operate on past freezes the tool we are
using right now generates the sudo
random keys to be used in this
explanation once we generate the keys
you can see the public key is rather
smaller than the private key which is
almost always the case these two keys
are mathematically linked with each
other they cannot be substituted with
any other key and in order to encrypt
the original message or decrypt the
cipher text this pair must be kept
together the public key is then sent to
the sender and the receiver keeps the
private key with himself
in this scenario let's try and encrypt a
word simply
learn we have to select if the key being
used for encryption is either private or
public since that affects the process of
scrambling the information since we are
using the public key over here let's
select the same and copy it and paste
over
here the cipher we are using right now
is plain RSA there are some modified
ciphers with their own pros and cons
that can also be used provided we use it
on a regular basis and depending on the
use case as well once you click on
encrypt we can see the cipher text being
generated over
here the sudo random generating
functions are created in such a way that
a single character change in the plain
text will trigger a completely different
Cipher text this is a security feature
to strengthen the process from Brute
Force methods now that we are done with
the encryption process let's let's take
a look at the decryption
part the receiver gets this Cipher text
from the sender with no other key or
supplement he or she must already
possess the private key generated from
the same pair no other private key can
be used to deip the message since they
are mathematically linked we paste the
private key here and select the same the
cipher must always so be the same used
during the encryption process
once we click decrypt you can see the
original plane text we had decided to
encrypt this sums up the entire process
of RSA encryption and
decryption now some people use it the
other way around we also have the option
of using the private key to encrypt
information and the public key to
decrypt it this is done mostly to
validate the origin of the message since
the keys only work in pairs if a
different private key is used to encrypt
the message the public key cannot
decrypt it conversely if the the public
key is able to decrypt the message it
must have been encrypted with the right
private key and hence the rightful owner
here we just have to take the private
key and use that to encrypt the plain
text and select the same in this
checkbox as well you can see we have
generated a completely new Cipher text
this Cipher text will be sent to the
receiver and this time we will use the
public key for
decryption let's select the correct
checkbox and decrypt and we still get
the same
output now let's take a look at
practical example of encryption in the
real
world we all use the internet on a daily
basis and many are aware of the
implications of using unsafe websites
let's take a look at Wikipedia here
pretty standard https website where the
H stands for secured let's take a look
at how it secures the
data wi shock is the world's foremost
and most WI widely used Network protocol
analyzer it lets you see what's
happening on your network at a
microscopic level and we are going to
use the software to see the traffic that
is living a machine and to understand
how vulnerable it
is since there are many applications
running in this machine let's apply a
filter that will only show us the
results related to Wikipedia
[Music]
let's search for something that we can
navigate the website
with okay once we get into it a little
you can see some of the requests being
populated over
here let's take a look at the specific
request these are the data packets that
basically transport the data from our
machine to the internet and vice
versa as you can see there's a bunch of
buch of gibberish data here that doesn't
really reveal anything that we searched
or watched similarly other secured
websites function the same way and it is
very difficult if at all possible to
Snoop on user data this way to put this
in
perspective let's take a look at another
website which is a HTTP web
page this has no encryption enabled from
the server and which makes it vulnerable
to attacks there is a login form here
which needs legitimate user credentials
in order to Grant access let's enter a
random pair of
credentials these obviously won't work
but we can see the manner of data
transfer unsurprisingly we weren't able
to get into the platform instead we can
see the data packets
let's apply a similar filter that will
help us understand what request this
website is
sending these are the requests being
sent by the HTTP login form to the
internet if we check here see whatever
username and password that we are
entering in we can easily see it with
the wire shark now we used a dummy pair
of credentials if we select the right
data packet we can find our correct
credentials if any website had asked for
a payment information or a legitimate
credentials it would have been really
easy to get a hold of these to reiterate
what we have already learned we must
always avoid HTTP websites and just
unknown or not trustworthy websites in
general because the problem we saw here
is just the tip of the iceberg even
though crypto graphy has managed to
lessen the risk of cyber attacks it is
still prevalent and we should always be
alert to keep ourselves safe online who
sites to switch careers with cyber
security by learning from the experts
then try giving a short to Simply lar
postgraduate program in cyber security
with modules from MIT schwas man College
of Engineering the link is mentioned in
the description box that will navigate
to the course page where you can find a
complete overview of the program being
offered so importance of a cyber
security certification first and
foremost when I see a certific ification
I look at it from three different
aspects the first is the training itself
which allows me to gain the knowledge
which allows me to understand the
aspects of security or whatever the
certification is there for the second
aspect is the exam itself how do I need
to prepare myself for the exam and how
do I need to approach the exam how do I
need to ensure that I pass in my first
attempt and the third aspect is the
certification itself which allows me to
be eligible to apply for a particular
job rule so obtaining a cyber security
certification ensures or shows uh to the
organization that you're applying to
that you do have that pre prerequisite
knowledge and you should be shortlisted
for an interview the knowledge that you
have gained during the training will
help you when you attend that interview
and when you attempt to answer the
questions asked to you so these
certifications are designed for a
specific rule uh for example a forensic
investigation certificate will teach you
how to investigate a crime scene
forensically a digital crime scene for
matter of fact a certified ethical
hacking course will teach you about
penetration testing so it is you who's
going to decide which certification you
require and then attempt get certified
on it of course a fresher with a cyber
security certification will have better
employment opportunities because they
can showcase their knowledge with the
certification that they already have
even professionals who want to enhance
their careers can get into managerial or
Advanced certifications to improve on
their knowledge and get promoted in
their job profiles so cyber security
cred uh certific ifications can be
classified in three different aspects
the first one being the foundational
level then the managerial level and the
advanced level uh in the previous video
we just had a small overview here we are
going to discuss about what the
certification covers how the exams are
conducted and uh the price points for
each and every exam so let's start with
the foundational certifications we start
off with CCNA which is the basic
certification for networking so the CCNA
routing and switching certification
basically it helps you build your
networking career you will join an
organization as a networking engineer
where you can help the organization
establish their routing uh the pathing
of how data packets will travel across
the network this certification covers
all the basic concepts that you require
to understand networking the basic
requirements for the certification are
that the candidate must have a
bachelor's degree but apart from that
there are no other prerequisites so it's
just that you need a bachelor's degree
and then you can apply uh you can study
for this you can undergo a training and
then you can attempt the exam uh the
certification provider obviously is
Cisco so the knowledge that is limited
to this training and certification is
for Cisco devices only the exam fees for
this certification is approximately
$325 the exam when it is conducted uh it
has around 50 to 60 odd questions which
need to be answered in 90 minutes the
type of questions that you're going to
get is multiple choice questions where
you have a question and four answers and
you have to choose the correct answers
among those drag and drop where you have
to click on an object and drag it to its
appropriate Place probably a
architectural diagram and you have to
let's say pick on a router and place it
into a particular uh position if you
place it correctly you answer the answer
the question correctly otherwise it's
wrong and a simulator where you where
there could be a configuration you need
to configure it in a particular Manner
and then check whether the configuration
is correct or not the pass Mark is
around 800 to 850 out of a possible
thousand marks so each question will
have a different weightage depending on
the depth of the question depending on
the difficult level of the question or
the difficulty level of the question
which uh would then count towards your
marks and if you score 800 to 850 that's
when you clear the exam the job roles as
we have discussed over here would be
more more on the network administrator
side or a network engineer side
depending on the level of experience
that you have the salaries uh that are
expected from this job roles in the US
are around $55,000 to $90,000 annually
the next one is the comcha certification
called Security Plus comare is also a
global certification Authority for uh
infosec courses so this certification
teaches candidates on how to secure
applications networks and devices it
focuses on Hands-On practical skills in
the field of network security I have
trained people on this certification
myself so uh I know this certification
is quite Hands-On it deals with the
concepts to the core it helps you
understand the concepts and then in the
Practical Hands-On demo uh you need to
execute the Practical yourself so that
uh you can gain that knowledge the
recommended level for a candidate to
attempt this training would be at least
around 2 years of experience in the it
sector in addition if you have already
been certified for Network plus
certification from comia which is the
Baseline networking certification this
is also a preferred way to go for this
certification as said comcha is the
certificate provider and the exam fees
for this certification is
$339 the exam is quite simple 90
questions in 90 minutes that's 1 minute
per question it sounds like a lot of
time but believe me the questions can be
a little bit confusing can be a little
bit lengthy so you will require all
those 90 minutes to answer those
questions especially when they're tricky
and they're technical in nature the
questions would be multiple choice and
performance- based the pass Mark for
this exam is around 750 points out of a
possible 900 the job profiles for this

this is an offensive certification so
here you're basically trying to become a
penetration tester you're taught how to

those flaws or mitigate those flaws and
improve the security of that
organization it is recommended that you
have 2 years of experience at least in
networking or security for these uh to

certifications again a basic
understanding of networking maybe a
little bit of applications operating
systems would be necessary uh before
attempting this certification the
certification provider is EC Council and
the exam fees for this certification is
$500 so the exam here would be 125
questions which needs to be attempted in
4 hours and you will only get multiple
choice questions in here now for CH
there are two exams one is the multiple
choice questions and the second is a
practical exam where uh you need to
solve some given problems to you in a
IAB scenario and if you are able to
solve them properly you then get
certified for CH practical the cut off
varies from 65 to 85% depending on the
questions that you have answered and the
weightage associated with each and every
question as said the job roles would be
as a penetration tester a security
engineer and your salaries would start
from around $90,000 annually then comes
the CND or the certified Network
Defender also from EC Council now this
is more on the network defense site so
here again the job rules would be where
you uh where there's a network that you
have and you're going to try to secure
the network and the communications that
are going to travel over the network so
you need to be a network administrator
network security engineer or uh in a
similar profile to understand how
networks work and then you're going to
attempt to secure those networks the
certificate provider again is EC Council
and the certification is placed a little
bit below C so it becomes Network
defense then C where you're going to
become a penetration Tester the exam
fees for this certification is
$350 the exam the exam is of 100
questions to be answered in 4 hours

85% depending on the questions answered
and the weightage of that question job
rules to be applied Network defense
technician CND analyst or a security

$75,000 per anom then comes the forensic
investigator course which is exactly
what it is digital forensic investigator
this will help you understand how
computers work where data is stored and
how you can retrieve that data to
investigate a crime that has uh taking
place so the candidate must have at

information security sector they need a
good understanding of how networks work
how computers work how operating systems
work how they store data the location
where that data is stored how databases

certification is s after mainly in the
law enforcement areas but there are a
few corporates that offer forensic
investigation as a service especially
when a corporate gets compromised and
they want to uh conduct their own
investigations the certification
provider for this is also AC Council and
the exam fees are $500 this is an
advanced level certification so uh
understanding of applications Networks
and operating systems is a must before
you attend this the exam is quite
similar 150 questions in 4 hours again
it's just a multiple choice question
exam the cut off again is from 60% to
85% depending on the questions and the
weightage of each and every question job
rules it security specialist network
security pro the job roles foreign sake
investigators law enforcement agencies
security Specialists homeland security
jobs and your salaries would be around
$888,000 and above all right now let's
let's talk about the managerial level
certifications kit stands for control
objectives for information and related
Technologies it's a certification that
will give a candidate an in-depth
knowledge of the framework which kobit
is all about and the framework helps you
manage and govern Enterprise it
environments now this is Advanced
certification so around 8 years of
managerial experience is suggested
before you attempt the kobit 5
certification to understand all the
aspects and to help you implement the
framework properly the certification
certificate provider is isaka the exam
fees are around
$175 now this is a small exam 50
questions but in 40 minutes so you
really have to be on your toes you have
to know the knowledge there's a very
limited time to think and you have to be
fast in your answers the past percentage
is 50% the job roles associated with
this certification would be to uh when
you apply for a information security
manager or as a security consultant or a
cyber security manager and your roles
and responsibilities would be to govern
the an uh it space that the organization
owns so all the servers desktops the
network the data flows the databases
everything and how it needs to be
managed and how it needs to be governed
in a secure manner annual salaries would
be around $100,000 plus then the cism
also called as cisem it stands for
certified information security manager
and as the name suggests it's a security
manager certification it helps the
candidate in understand understanding
the relationship between business goals
and information security so now you're
going into the space where you're not
only technical in nature but you also
have to understand the business needs
the goals of the business and you have
to align the information security of
your infrastructure along with the
business needs and the business goals so
it is your inputs that are going to go
to the management to see if the
infrastructure is aligned to the
business goals or if the infrastructure
or the business goals need any
fine-tuning around 5 years of work
experience is recommended in the
information security field for
attempting the cism out of the 5 years
the candidate must have a background as
an information security manager for 3
years so you have some experience as a
manager uh you have implemented those
things yourselves which will give you a
better understanding and then you
attempt the certification again
providing by isaka and the exam fees for
isaka members is
$575 for non-members it is
$760 the exam is very you have to answer
150 questions in 4 hours uh quite a bit
of time but questions are going to be uh
scenario based questions where they're
going to give you a lot of scenarios you
have to think about it and you have to
give the most probable and the correct
answer for that particular scenario the
pass Mark is 450 out of 800 your job
profiles would be either a risk manager
or a risk consultant analyzing the
business requirements to the
infrastructure security that uh that you
have and to identify if there any risks
associated with the infrastructure
highlight those risks and then put in
security controls and manage those
controls in a way where security is
mitigated your average salaries would be
around $88,000 and above then the cisa
or the cisa the certified Information
Systems auditor certification it not
only looks into security but it also
looks into auditing and controls uh in
Information Systems this is a highly
reputed certificate and you gain a
better understanding of governance
regulations and and auditing your
information landscape again a minimum of
5 years of work work experience in the
field of Information Systems auditing
control or security is necessary now
here the question would be what's the
difference security is where your
technical in nature you have done let's
say a vulnerability assessment or a
penetration test you have implemented
firewalls you have architected security
controls are all about the security
controls that you're going to implement
like firewalls idss ipss data loss
prevention systems uh maybe even uh UTM
and whatnot so experience in
architecting or implementing those
controls in an effective manner
mitigating your security or your your
vulnerabilities that you have identified
in the organization and auditing would
basically mean about looking at
compliance to ensure that everything is
in place you're compliant with let's say
uh ISO 2701 guidelines or the policies
that you have created yourself and
everything is working in order so it's
more of a checklist where you're going
to just check everything is in place and
you're conforming to standards this
certification is also provided by isaka
and the exam fees for isaka members are
$575 whereas non isaka members will have
to pay $760 for the certification $1 150
questions again in 4 hours multiple
choice questions scenario based so you
have to really understand the real world
scenarios of where what controls and
what audit mechanisms should be in place
pass Mark is 450 out of 800
your job roles would be mainly becoming
an auditor or a senior auditor a
director for information security
information audit manager or a
Information Technology consultant where
you provide Intelligence on how the
company should Implement their
infrastructure average salaries would be
103,000 and above then comes the crisc
also called as crisk uh certified in
risk and information systems control
certification helps the candidate design
and maintain Information Systems
controls for an organization this is one
of the most sought after certifications
as far as risk management is concerned
in Europe and in us if you have this
kind of certifications you automatically
qualify for a risk manager or a security
risk manager or a information security
consultant kind of a role you should
have a minimum of three years of
experience in the field of is controls
that means information security controls
you should have knowledge about
Fireballs you should know about how to
mitigate risks how to identify risks in
the first place risk analysis risk
management and after which you're going
to implement security controls to
mitigate that risk or bring it to
acceptable levels at this point in time
you will also be responsible to create
policies revolving those risks and how
you want to calculate those risks and
treat those risks in their lifetime
certificate provider again is isaka $575
for isaka members $760 for non isaka
members for the exam fees a similar
question 150 questions to be answered in
4 hours multiple choice based on
performances so they may give you a
scenario where you have to perform a
risk analysis and provide a report and a
solution based on your findings again
the pass Mark is 450 out of 800 the job
profiles Associated as discussed earlier
are the it risk management professionals
where they're going to identify risks
treat those risks calculate analyze
maybe do a business impact analysis to a
certain how uh the organization is going
to be affected and then you will also be
looking at compliances as far as these
job roles are concerned average annual
salary would be 119,000 and above moving
on to advanced level certification now
this is where we come across a cissp or
the cisp certification certified
information system security professional
this is the gold standard of all
certifications if you have this
certificate it's you can basically be
assured of a job in the IT world now
just to qualify you'll have to have 5
years of experience in the information
uh security field there are eight
domains that are specified by cissp and
you have to prove that you have
knowledge and you have work experience
of around 5 years in at least two of
those domains if you do not have those
kind of experiences you can still
attempt the exam but you become an
associate of ISC Square which means that
youve get 6 years to accomplish the 5
years of uh experience requirement for
this certification before taking up the
CIS certification is suggested that the
candidate clears all the intermediate
level certifications not all but some of
them in in fact I've seen people do the
other way around they qualify for cissp
they give the exam once your cissp the
cisa or cesm cisa or cism exams are way
easier to crack but you need to have
that kind of experience I seen people
with 15 years of experience and more
fail at this certification in the first
attempt the certificate provided is IC
Square the exam fees is
$699 like I said this certification is
where most sought after the gold
standard in fact there there's hardly
any other certifications after this that
you might want to do the questions now
the exam has changed if it is the
English version that you're giving it's
150 questions to be answered in 3 hours
if it is the non-english exam that
you're attempting then it is 250
questions in 6 hours it's a marathon and
if you're opting for the 6-h hour exam
you need to plan it really well it
sounds really easy but the questions are
quite tough they're scenario based and
the answers are quite confusing as well
you would get multiple choice questions
you would get drag and drop and you
might get simulators as well uh the pass
Mark is 700 out of 1,000 but each
question has a different weightage so uh
it depends on which questions are asked
of you and which questions you've
answered correctly the job rules
associated with this certification would
be anything and everything in
information security at the managerial
level and above so information security
manager risk manager system uh
information system security officer the
ceso RO the ciso Chief Information
security officer any role that you might
think of as a risk from a risk
compliance strategy could be achievable
after this kind of a certification the
average annual salary is
$108,000 for this certification with

shall we
start okay hi uh good evening one and
all uh I know I know the difficult phase
that you are going through okay but make
sure uh you will be rewarded okay so
whatever you have done you will get a
decent reward for the work whatever
you're doing so the first and foremost
suggestion from my side is uh please
trust the process you just trust the
process okay and just go ahead with your
preparation okay don't doubt yourself
that is a main suggestion I can give you
uh because I have I have been in this
situation for more than 10 years okay
from past 10 years I'm constantly going
through this situation with a number of
students and I was in this situation for
two to three times because I have
attempted I have given my entrance two
to three times so apart from that uh you
the Ninth Batch of MDS conquer so I have
more than 10 years of experience in
handling the situation so the greatest
suggestion that I can give you is
whatever that is going through whatever
you people are like feeling you get up
in the morning you start reading you
doubt
yourself you give exams sometimes the
scores will be high sometimes the scores
will be low okay you have that ups and
downs right whether whether I can do
this or not you doubt
yourself you doubt when you're giving an
MC you doubt when you're reading a
subject you doubt okay so you keep a
keep a doubt so this is a very very
common thing that every student has okay
even even the topper even the all India
topper everyone is going to have the
same feeling so you not an exception for
this so that is my suggestion so
whenever you doubt yourself or whenever
you're are not feeling comfortable with
yourself about the preparation okay just
tell yourself that you're not exception
for this you are a part
of many others many others similarly
have this feeling okay few of them they
try to hide it but it is a common
feeling that every student has okay so
then you need to you need to talk to
yourself more okay you need to talk to
yourself you should motivate yourself
okay of course we you have mentors who
can help you at any time okay but
keeping that aside the best motivator
for you in the last 25 days we are left
over with the last 25 days the best
motivator for you is you it's you you
are going to be the uh the person who
can handle the situation well
who are you are going to be the person
who can experience the situation well
and who can come out of the situation
well with a good rank okay so as you
know that okay we are left over
with 25
days you're left over with the 25 days
uh 25 days of your preparation I want
you to split this 25 days
into 13 and 12
days make sure last 12 days so I have
discussed this so many times to most of
you okay so last 12 days you should give
your
best you should give your best without
wasting any time without wasting any
time I want you to give your best to
cover as much content as possible in the
most organized way okay I want you to
cover the content possibly in the most
organized way okay that is that is very
very important because uh I see most of
you like most of the students even
including myself so confused in the last
10 to 12 Days like what to be done like
for example today's my I have prepared a
schedule that today I want to start
biochemistry in the morning so once you
open uh once you get up and start open
the biochemistry maybe you you maybe
like 1 hour or two hours late to the
schedule because of some personal
commitment and once you are late by uh 2
hours like for example you thought of
starting at 7:00 and you were starting
at 9 or 10:00 you'll be a big dilemma
that what I need to do you get stuck
okay so I want you to get out of it okay
so whatever you in the you whatever you
do in the next 13 days okay you have 13+
12 right so whatever you do in the next
13 days should always focus on giving
you what you have to do in the last 12
days for example I'm just giving a I'm
just giving a suggestion for example if
I'm uh if I am like uh I think of like
doing uh a dental anotomy on a day for
example if I want to do dental
anotomy from my point of view I'm not
telling in general point of view from my
point of view so if I thought of doing
Dental anotomy my schedule for dental
anotomy will be in the last 12 days will
be 3 to 4 hours only because this
carrying seven marks 3 to 4 hours for me
is sufficient because I can revise the
dental anatomy in 3 to 4 hours and what
I will focus on revision of dental
Anatomy is my first checklist is going
to be the dental pulse
synopsis in that synopsis I'll try to
focus more on I told you right eruption
sequence is
important I'll try to focus on more
about permanent
dentation all the characteristic
features I want to check out the groups
misol lingual group is seen in paling
Groove is seen in so all groups peculiar
futur I want to focus on all the pecular
features of the permanent
dentation then I want to focus on
maxillary first
molar mandibular first molar because
mostly they ask questions on these
areas I focus on facial lingual
inclinations and miso distal angulations
table I'll focus on the contact Point
stable I'll focus on uh developmental
low
loes how many loes from each and every
teeth developed I I'll focus on the
developmental loes table
okay then I'll go back and check the
color
plates not all the color plates because
my shedule is just 3 to four hours I
will focus on the color plates of
maxillary
Mander permanent
teeth particularly mostly they may not
ask questions on uh incisors I'll try to
focus on canines difference between Max
Canon and mandibular Canon left canine
and right canine I'll focus on premolars
I'll focus on molars mostly the
questions will be on first molars
only questions will be on all the
premolars questions will be on the
canines so color plates I'll try to
check some color plates okay so this is
a checklist for that three to four hours
apart from this whatever that is there
on your dental pulse synopsis part I'll
be giving as a priority I'll be doing it
and I have my shot short notes okay so
all the confusion areas all the
overlapping areas what is obl Ridge so
all this confusion areas whatever I have
written a short notes of two or three
pages so I'll be doing the two or three
pages of notes in this through two to
three hours for example if I'm done with
two to three hours so I'm left over with
one more hour so what I'll do I'll try
to revise it the same or what I can do
is I can do the recent recent W question
I'll say I'll check 2023 I'll check 2022
or what I can do is I can open the
subject
specific exam of dental Anatomy which is
there on the website okay or dental
anotomy combination of dental histology
I'll try to check the questions okay
because my Moto is not to give an exam
in that three to four hours my Moto is
to recollect and revise as much content
as possible guys I hope this is very
very clear okay I hope this is very very
clear I'm just giving an example I'm not
I'm just giving an example I don't want
you to follow this checklist this is
what I will do because I know this is
how I can manage this subject at the
best right so this is how you have to
plan the last 12 days properly what to
be done in a particular subject so I I I
I always told you like last 12 days of
your examination should be something
like a a big table a full meals should
be there in front of you everything
properly organized whatever you want to
eat for the 12 days should be on your
table whatever you want to revise
whatever you want to see I want to check
the previous question papers where from
a book or from the website I want to
check the short notes as where from the
book or from the websites everything
like if you're an offline student
offline paper should be in front of you
that's a that's a checklist meal if
you're a PR student all the pr Pap
should be there in front of you okay if
you're a planer student or R student all
your quick revision content should be
there in front of you so along with the
mocks along with the modules along with
whatever you prepared to be done in that
particular subjects so proper
scheduling proper schedule like what to
be done in the 12 days leave about last
two days to the exam so what to be done
in the 10 days leaving the two days 12
plus 10 plus 2 12 days so what to be
done in the 10 days you should clearly
plan and everything should be there in
front of you this is how you can
organize yourself organizing yourself in
the last 10 to 12 days is going to save
lots of time and if you can save lots of
time in the last 10 to 12 Days you can
give more more importance to Reading
part once you read more content on a
particular day that is going to give you
confidence okay for example like uh you
thought of doing only one two subjects
on a particular day but luckily because
your content is well organized okay what
you have done is you have done three
subjects so thought of doing two when
you're doing three in the last 10 days
that is going to boost up your
confidence like anything okay so once
you have a confidence you can drive
through the preparation in a smoothest
way okay so that's what I'm always
stressing you so you should organize
everything and everything should be in
front of all the checklist whatever you
want to do whatever you want like for
example like most of you prepare notes
where are they where are they you turn
the pages and if you want to check out
something it's going to take so much of
the time okay that's what I'm telling
like everything should be organiz Endo
okay I'll do this 3 to four hours done
operator I'll do this 5 to six hours
done so on a day if you can do one major
subject and one minor subject along with
the other contents whatever you give as
a priority so that is going to be more
than sufficient for you to handle the
situation at that particular time so
this is an example that I'm giving so
what my suggestion is so 25 days I want
you to split like okay today is done so
you have 24 days so let's make it as 12
+ 12 so last 12 days is going to be 10
plus 2 last two days you leave it okay
don't don't postpone anything to the
last two days I want you to be more
comfortable more EAS more relaxed in the
last two days okay but this 10 days will
play a very vital
role and plan accordingly basing upon
your comfort you want to go with a
combination of subjects or you want to
go with one major subject and one minor
subject You Wish For example like few
people they can go with the combination
oropo on one
day maybe general surgery oral surgery
GS and oral surgery on one day maybe
Pharma general medicine physio General
path General path for two days so such a
combination you can you can do basing
upon your comfort like pedo endo on one
day operative DM on one day so basing
upon the Comfort like you plan
accordingly okay so this planning is
very very important one big
suggestion second thing in the last 10
plus two in the last 10 plus two don't
try to read new subjects don't try to
read new new contents okay for example
uh in the middle of a in the middle of
an exam like when you're discussing or
something was posted on the whatsa group
or someone something was discussed by
your friend some new content yes you can
do it but I don't want you to read two
hours 3 hours four hours of new content
okay which is because the exam always
requires revision so these exams which
requires revision how to handle the
revision revisiting the thing is very
very important so what my recommendation
is okay new content should not be more
than 5 to 10 percentage of time it's
very difficult to avoid the new content
very difficult to avoid the new content
impossible to avoid the new content so
some or other the new content or new
question or a controversy question or a
discussion or something will come in
front of you so you cannot avoid them so
but make sure you cannot keep more than
5 to 10 percentage of time in the last
uh 10 to 10 days and particularly and
when I'm talking about the upcoming 12
days you can keep uh maybe 25 to 30
percentage of time for the new content
I hope guys you are clear I want your
quick response on the chat box so that
uh there few things which I feel like I
I thought of discussing with you guys
okay
right yeah so okay clear so next world
is I I don't want you to do spend more
than 25 to 30 percentage of your time on
the new content and the last 10 days I
want you to spend only 5 to 10
percentage of time on the new content
okay
right okay done okay the next important
aspect the next important aspect
is just a
second okay so I don't know like people
uh most of you are at different uh
levels of your preparation few of you
you feel like you're doing good but not
so so confident few of you are confident
but scores were up up and down few of
you are not reading well not able to
manage the time well so I don't want to
discriminate people over here okay so
everyone are at are at different levels
of their preparation but for the next 2
24 days okay I want you to give 100
percentage commitment to the preparation
let's give nothing wrong okay that you
are not going to lose anything okay
let's give 100 percentage okay
commitment for the next 24
24 24 days okay right and the second
important aspect is the second most
important aspect is
uh see what is what what are your uh
like what are your armentarium here okay
so the big armentarium here according to
me okay so I'll respond you at any time
okay I'll respond you I'm trying to
clear as many doubts I'm spending more
than 8 to 10 hours per day only on
clearing the doubts okay but uh my
suggestion for all of you my suggestion
for all of you
is biggest s biggest uh suggestion for
all of you
is use me properly in this 24 days okay
this is going to change your game
completely I can spend some time with
you and I can make sure that I will try
to cover as much important content as
possible along with you only when you
use me properly I see uh I don't want to
discourage people I see uh most of the
doubts like like for example I clear
like uh approximately 150 to 200 doubts
per uh per day 150 to 200 and out of
this more than 100 to 150 doubts were
already discussed but people still post
because they may not be active on the
group okay they may not be active on the
group they don't see what is happening
on the group group okay I'm very sorry
like I have discussed something on the
group nowadays I'm keeping
screenshots do you know why I'm keeping
screenshots I'm keeping screenshots at
the status anyone can answer
why any any specific reason why I'm
keeping no I want you to respond
me nowadays long back I never used to do
that nowaday I'm keeping
status now few people are not seeing
what is happening on the group okay
they're not seeing what is happening on
the group they see my status okay they
see my status that's the biggest problem
so please guys uh that is the reason why
like heavy heavy discussions I'm taking
on telegram doubts while stuff I'm
posting on WhatsApp group okay so my
kind suggestion is check WhatsApp
regularly okay like I know that okay I
know that you're so busy in Reading Okay
so so I accept that but please do check
the WhatsApp because most of the doubts
most of the controversial questions are
being posted on the WhatsApp which is
going to save your time because once you
have a question okay uh first of all you
need to analyze the question understand
the question then you feel you you have
to decide that the question is not
comfortable for you you have a doubt
then you need to take a pick then you
need to drop the pick to me then you
need to drop a message I feel the answer
is this uh why gone this something okay
then you need to wait for my replay then
I'll give the explanation then you have
to check out the explanation then again
you have to post the doubt if you have
any doubt regarding the explanation this
is going to take so much of time this is
going to kill your time as well as kill
my time okay right so the smartest thing
that you have to do
is exclusively every day 10 minutes or
15 minutes you try to spend some time
and check out the questions which are
posted as a doubts on the WhatsApp group
this is very very comfortable and
recommended suggestion that is going to
save your time which indirectly save my
time so once I have time I can take some
quick revision sessions for you I can
make some notes for you I can make some
important checklist revision for you
okay is it
fair I even if you post the same doubt
100 times to me I'll reply because that
is what my commitment is I stand to my
commitment I am I know that I am the
only one who is going to help you is
going to help you because I know that
I'm sitting 24 into 7 only for you guys
for you guys three or four groups I'm
sitting on you okay
right is is is it fair
deal now you check it off like you want
to have a great performance I can add on
that great I can add on that if you give
me space because as a human I have 24
hours of time uh for the basics and
everything like for sleeping I sleep
eight hours okay and for the basics and
everything maybe 4 hours the rest of the
time I'm spending in clearing your
doubts talking to you talking to your
parents talking to your Juniors upcoming
batch I need to prepare question papers
I need to check out the contents I need
to post I need to take WhatsApp activity
for you WhatsApp activity for your
Junior batch okay there there are many
things that I need to handle okay so if
you can allocate me uh one more hour of
time uh I can help you in that one hour
I can make an impact of getting 10 more
extra right answers that's going to
create an impact of plus 50 right
answers for sure okay for sure because I
can sense what what are the what are the
important things that that can come in
the
examination uh check checklist of the
important topics and since most sensible
is I can handle all the subjects that's
the extra Advantage I can correlate one
subject to other subject one topic to
other topic one sign to other sign so
that integrated content I can do I'm
very confident about that because I was
I was in this from past 10 years okay so
that is a that is a suggestion for you
if you can allocate me that one hour of
time every day I can add on uh maybe a
20 20 20 25 hours of uh a a good
oriented aspect where questions will
definitely touch where questions are
going to come and it's going to create
an impact right uh done so one about
about that one and the next one
is uh and the next important aspect I
want to stress on
is
uh so I hope like most of you posting
doubts regarding the negative marking
and everything negative marking I have
discussed disced in the last live class
so negative marking concept clearly
discussed in
the last live class so which is
available on
Instagram which is available on
Instagram and the link will be posted on
the group no need to worry uh the next
important aspect is okay uh like how to
handle in the next 12 days so this is
also I have discussed in the last class
but what suggestion I can give you is
like
uh like for example like you can split
your day one day you can split your day
into some four or five parts for example
like I hope like most of you are
touching the 12 to 14 hours of reading
time we are just left over with the last
24 24 days right so nothing wrong in
Reading 12 to 4 hours so in this I want
you to split the day into multiple Parts
okay maybe part one part two three for
example like 12 hours 2 hours 2 hours 2
hours part four is 3
hours and part five uh like part five
you can keep it as one more three hours
610 yeah we got 12 hours right so in
this what you can do is part one you can
give for module one
subjects and let's start the day uh
let's start the day with Mod one okay or
if you're feeling comfortable you can
start the day with module 4 which is the
most difficult module okay and scoring
module okay and part two you can keep uh
module two 2 hours module three 2 hours
module four you can keep uh 3 hours and
module five okay so what you can do is
you can split this module five into 1 2
3 and you can drop them here in the
middle uh part five subpart one
in the middle part five subp part two in
the middle part five subp part three so
by which you can add one hour here one
hour here one hour here so it is very
simple you don't need to follow the same
sequence you can you can prepare the
content according to your wish so what
you can do is module
one 2
hours followed
by part
five subpart for one
then module
two for 2
hours then part five subpart two for 1
hour then module
three for 2 hours module 3 is the
shortest module okay so you can make it
as one and off hour also no problem then
part five subpart three for one hour
then module
4 for 2 +
1 3 hours okay so this is how you can
manage what you have to do in the part
five so normally you check it off okay
so you check it off you have your module
one you're going to focus on module one
subject module two module three and
module four so what you're are going to
do in the part five is I want you to
focus uh
more
about part five I want you to focus more
on modules module
exams because you have four module exams
each of 240 questions I want you to be
perfect with each and every question
question question related uh
classification question related
explanation question related table or
some points whatever it is discussed I
want you to be perfect what you have to
do is you you have to be perfect with
all the mock
exams whatever you have whatever access
you have and second thing you have to be
perfect with all the grand exams
previously done Grand exams each and
every McQ you see McQ you should be very
sharp in telling the answer accurately
and you should tell the underlining
explanation Also the table okay what
class one is this class two is this so
this is what I want you to have the
repeated revision keep on doing the
revision revision is uh a very very
important aspect like keep on seeing the
same McQ keep on seeing the same table
keep on seeing the same classification
part then you will be confident in the
exam when same question is coming okay
right so let it be uh if you want to
focus you can focus on subject
specific or you want to focus on topic
specific or any sort of mcqs on the
website I want you to do the mcqs in the
part five do the mcqs if you're already
done revise the mcqs check the mcqs
again again again again same content
again and again let it be from the
website or let it be any sort McQ part
okay it's more of an McQ part and
Priority First modules should be given
priority then mock should be given
priority then the grand exams and
subject specific do the same mcqs
because you when you when you're
checking more mcqs every day there is a
high chance that the same concept or the
same content can be repeated in the exam
okay that's a simple uh common sense it
regularly
happens
okay right so that is that is about your
splitting about your day if you are
comfortable to prepare your own schedule
this is a common thing that I'm giving
as a suggestion okay it's not mandatory
that you have to follow this if you have
anything in your mind you can go with
that particular pattern of revision or
particular pattern of scheduling but if
you are not confident about it you're
not confident like whether you're going
right or wrong you can post it to me we
can discuss and we can confirm okay
right clear clear clear I want you to
respond me on the chat
box okay next coming to the uh
examination time management a few people
are asking
this if you are giving mock exams
regularly if you are giving modu exams
regularly okay and I don't feel there is
any need of time issue in your neat MDS
exam because uh the advantage of MDS
conquer student is your reading capacity
is very very fast when compared to any
other student reason one is because
you're going to have the
highest WhatsApp highest content of
WhatsApp activity as an McQ as a reading
pattern or as a voice note pattern you
are going to have the high
WhatsApp exposure in the entire country
of any other Institute I can openly bet
on this and I I can openly say this okay
so there's nothing to worry about it so
the only thing that you have to focus is
reading a particular question which is
available on screen is not a biggest
deal for you okay so now the second
thing is how do you manage time
management is not at all an issue in the
last five years I have I have never seen
a big complaint from the students about
the time management but so check it off
your uh your exam has been splitted into
two parts Part A and Part B part A will
be 100 mcqs and Part B will be 140 mcqs
okay right so plan accordingly there's
nothing wrong that you have to follow
this particular uh phase or particular
thing whatever you want you can do it's
not like your in C where one block will
be closed second block will be open you
don't have that stories in your neat
examination as of now okay but according
to the uh the the information bulletin
also you don't have any such updates so
it is comfortable whatever you want to
check you can check but what's my
suggestion uh my suggestion is it's your
wish whether you start with a part A or
Part B it's completely your wish but I
want you to do mcqs uh in two rounds
only two rounds three rounds four rounds
there are many classifications on the uh
YouTube channels okay but I strongly
recommend you to do in two rounds okay
so round
one round one you have to do all
mcqs all questions
except focus on exception
except questions which are
lengthy don't do questions which are
leny because neat is clearly telling
that you have to solve the question in
40 to 45 seconds if you're solving
questions which are lengthy questions
which are lengthy are will eat have a
time of two to three questions okay so
instead of doing a lengthy question in
the first round you can do two to three
short short questions single liner
something like that okay right so
questions which are lengthy has to be
done in the round
two questions which require more
thinking questions which require more
thinking number three questions which
require mathematical
calculations or
formula
insertions okay mathematical
calculations formula insertions such a
questions okay all these three category
of questions has to be done in round
two okay and please try to avoid
questions which you don't
know
because don't know questions which you
don't know can be solved in the round
two by
elimination or by
Logic okay by elimination or by Logic
you can solve this questions in the
round two because applying elimination
is going to eat away more time applying
the Logics thinking will eat away more
time so my concent is in round one I
want you to solve the questions which
are easy questions which are simple
questions which are repeats questions
which you are familiar with questions
which you know try to avoid lengthy
questions try to avoid questions which
you need to think more try to avoid
questions which you need to think and
recollect the classifications or
something mathematical calculations
formula insertion based questions
questions where you need to think
eliminate the options apply the Logics
all these has to be done in the round
two leftover questions you can done in
the round
one clear I want I want your response on
the chat box I'll move to the next
important topic to be
discussed okay done so these are the
main things which I feel like I need to
discuss with you today so I'm done from
my side uh the only golden suggestion I
can give you is uh in this 2 24 days
okay the qualities that a good aspirant
or a good good ranker or good good
student like let let consider it as a
good good reader good reader is use your
time in the most effective way don't
fight for mcqs don't fight for answers
don't fight for explanations don't fight
on controversial questions I still
remember there are a bulk of
controversial questions long back in
2014 when I was giving exam okay and if
you check out
now 2014 controversial questions are
still controversial we don't have an
answer for them okay still I I consider
them as a controversial question and
most of you who are posting questions
before 2014 you see regularly you post
questions right you see you post
questions before 2014 I'm very confident
because I know what are controversial
questions from my preparation okay so
they are controversial in the next 10
years also if we don't change the uh the
main source of the book okay you see
Dental puls or you see dentist or you
see any other book I don't know why they
they they still keep this controversial
questions fights for the controversy I
don't know why they they can simply
eliminate these questions right by which
they can save the time of the student I
don't know the Logics here but it's okay
so maybe uh if the pulse is is is going
to be the source of the book for the
next couple of years we have this
controversial headache in the last 24 24
days or last 25 days so my suggestion
for you is don't waste time on
controversial questions and second thing
what I have observed in the last um 10
to 15 days they are you see like they
are they very apprehensive students will
will be there like anxiety and
everything they read multiple Books Okay
sometimes it's going to be so hurting
you read multiple books because long
back like you see like before 2017 2017
W stuff uh you have only one main source
for uh these repeats okay one main
source I don't want to discuss the name
of the books we have only one uh main
source for the book okay and I see most
of the other other uh authors they just
try to copy the content from these books
but now because of the computation
because of the impact of the social
media okay uh the question everyone are
preparing their own uh questions after
the exam and you see when someone is
preparing their own questions collecting
questions after the exam more
controversy see like one question you
have a different answer in Dental pulse
you have a different answer in nearest
birth one you have a different answer in
different different Books Okay so
reading more number of books at this
particular time for a particular thing
okay so what I can give you like for
example you thought of reading 2019
question paper if you want to read 2019
question paper read only from One Source
very logical very sweet suggestion yeah
okay there's nothing wrong hurting
hurting anyone okay let it be you read
from only one source I don't know why
you are reading preparing a chart like
this something like this you see sir
answer Dental pulse a nasad is telling C
website is given something different
okay questions will be
different different the answers of a
questions will be different basing upon
the options basing upon the keywords in
the question slightly varies basing upon
the reference it varies basing upon the
author it varies so my suggestion for
the people who want to achieve good rank
you want to read repeats do it from only
one source and I clearly told 2018 2019
20 21 22 along with 23 you can trust
website accuracy I can provide you up to
98 99 percentage of accuracy I can give
you because I'm I'm working on it I'm
finding the references I'm discussing
with Mentor who has more experience who
are authors we are discussing and
concluding the answer so what I can tell
you from 2018 vaa to 2023 vaa you can
blindly trust the answers which are
there on the website okay and it's going
to provide you an accuracy of 98 to 99
perent which is compared to the which if
you compare the accuracies of different
different books I can assure you the
website is going to have more accuracy
I'm not telling the mistakes will not be
there mistakes will be there because
there are controversial questions all
the questions I'm not talking talking
about controversial questions mistakes
can be there but I can give you an
accuracy of 98 to 99 percentage which is
highest compared to any other book
available on the website this is a very
very sweet suggestion if you want to be
topper don't spoil the party okay the
party is already fixed for you and if
you're reading multiple books
unnecessary for the same content
fighting for that wasting your time
you're unnecessary spoiling the party
this is one more suggestion uh which I
have personally seen in the seen with
very good students okay they are very
good they're scoring good okay it
happens okay and similarly uh different
book is going to have different
references it very slightly references
vary basing upon that the question can
is converted to controversy that's what
I'm telling so don't waste time on the
controversial questions it's okay stick
on to one answer whether it's right or
wrong don't do discussions because we
don't know what is the final answer
given by the need for example if you
know the final answer given by the nbe
then we can plan accordingly our
reference but we don't know the final
answer what answer they have given also
we don't know so let's not waste time on
this so stick on to one answer Move On
by which you are going to save time the
time can be used for revision of other
contents and other purpose okay
right right so those are the important
things which I feel like and maybe like
every two or third day
maybe I'll be coming live for half an
hour not more time I'll be coming live
for half an hour telling some giving
some good suggestions okay suggestions
are very important talking sweet being
good being nice being motivative is more
important what I I I feel I require in
my preparation phase during the last uh
one
month what I expect from my mentor I'm
here to give that to you guys okay right
so that is uh that is that that that is
how I I'm mouting myself okay sometimes
I'm I'm stressing out because the stress
that is being created by you okay I'm
stressing out but I'm trying to I'm
trying to uh manage those things but
I'll what what what I can say is I can
I'll give you 100% is what you are going
to expect from the mentor okay right so
any doubts you can post it on the chat
box so that I'll try to discuss and help
you
out not so comfortable you can post it
personally on the chat
box that's what I'm telling you can 2018
19 2020 21 22 23 you can you can rely
the mcqs only on the website all the
questions all the possible questions
from different different sources along
with the corrections along with the
references were posted to you so best
way to read the repeats from 18 to from
23 is your website before that you want
to do you can stick on to any one source
it is nether nearest B one or either
Dental pulse basing upon the book that
is accessible to you if you have both I
recommend you to go to nearest bad one
if you don't have nearest bad one uh you
have only Dental puls you can go with
the dental puls I hope this is very very
clear stick on to only one book 18 to 23
only website before that if you're if
you want to do 2017 2010 2011 to 2017
okay you can you can relay
any of this nearest B one is the best
option if you don't have nearest B one
you can you can go for dental
PS can we skip as and uh PGA yes I told
you I told you already to skip them in
the last in Instagram
live as we are approaching you want to
read the underlined content what you
have prepared you can do it but if you
want to read it fresh now don't read
them not
required has daily
motivations yeah we are posting
yeah every every every second day or
third day I think like uh last five days
before five days I Came
live and I'm posting most of
the I I don't have I don't have as 2024
paper
sorry
anything
more now revision pattern uh varies from
student to student basing upon the score
okay so you can personally ping me with
your recent mock screenshots so I'll
tell tell you to what to revise to
improve your scores for example your
scores are 300 4 00 pattern should be
different because to improve your scores
uh to 400 500 or 500 to 600 already if
you're scoring 600 700 the pattern is
going to be different checklist will
slightly vary
okay that you can ping me personally
with the recent exams whatever you have
given if you two correct options are
there no the question is not about
choosing the correct answer the question
is about the choosing the best option so
so you need to choose the best option
among the two options that are available
for you that's what I'm telling like
when you have more correct answers in a
question then the controversy is going
to come I'm going to tell this is the
correct answer you're going to tell this
is the correct answer you will show a
reference for that I'll show a reference
for that but we don't know what paper
set is thinking from paper Setter point
of view so in such situations you need
to compare and go for the best option
that is that's what I'm telling like
whenever I post something on the group
I'll tell two correct answers are there
but I'll tell you stick on to C is
better than a or sometimes I post B is
better than a b is better than a means
both are correct but B is best option
when compared to option A so if the same
question is given I want I'm I'm
indirectly telling that you want to go
you have to go for option
b how to use PP books in the last 24
that's what I'm telling like uh you plan
your revision like uh in the revision
plan like I have allocated uh two hours
for your module one two hours for module
two every day two hours for module three
so every day I have allocated two2 hours
for module 1 2 3 and followed by 4 hours
3 hours for module uh module uh three
followed by how allocated part five as a
model five so wherever you can
accommodate you can accommodate that's
what I'm telling if you want to read
anything new read in this 12 days only
that to read for only 30 to 40
percentage of time not more than that
but once you're jumping to last 10 days
I don't I don't want you to read
something new if you're not done PP
books till the date and if you if SC if
your scores are allowing you to do that
you can do it now in the next 10 days
but not in the last 10
days is there any option of resting the
P resetting the paper again on the
website for the students who has already
no no we don't have such options sir you
can cannot give exam twice in MDS
conquer only once you can check the
answers you can you can revise them okay
you can give exam only
once are the questions from PP books
must do not not must do if you have time
you can do it should we planed revision
twice in the last 25 days or twice no
that is your comfort like for example I
read fast because I'm reading from past
12 years so I read fast so I can plan
more rounds of revision so it it it
varies with the student student
intensity with what they are doing so
that's what I'm telling like in the next
10 days because we are done with
tomorrow by tomorrow we are done with we
are done with all the four modules so
next B days you can plan one round last
10 days you can plan one A different
round my suggestion is go with two but
if you can do three yeah you're most
welcome three or four times is most
welcome how to maintain consistent this
course consistency in this course cannot
be maintained because you cannot have
the same balanced paper every paper
cannot be a balanced paper but once you
check out the group of five or six
papers they together have the balance
that is very specific in MDS conquer
because I I filter every paper like for
example you have a difficult
paper the next one or two one the next
or the the next paper like for example
mock mock 10 is difficult 11 or 12 is
going to be so easy so that what we do
is we balance those three okay so don't
expect every paper should be a balanced
paper when someone like g s is preparing
he loves to give a tricky paper okay but
he will have that's what I'm telling he
he's going to give some easy questions
also according to the rules of question
Pap and when you see some some Mentor
like and other mentors they allow to
give difficult paper they want to filter
the students so they allow to give
difficult paper so you cannot assume
that every paper is going to be a
balanced paper so maintaining the
consistency in Mark is going to be
difficult but you have to maintain the
consistency in the rank rank consistency
is important rather than the mark
consistency for a person getting marks
in the range of 400 how to improve
please personally ping me on the
WhatsApp I'll tell you what to be done
if we read subject specific Grand marks
without content reading it's okay yeah
it's okay that's
good now content reading that's what I'm
telling like I already discussed in the
last Instagram live I'm telling you to
read the content only 30% is okay
already content reading is done in your
quick rision videos quick revision
videos it's a storytelling storytelling
is nothing but a Content reading so few
few days back we have done General
pathology synopsis that is also content
reading you doing explanation
explanation is a Content reading so my
suggestion is don't read question and
answer uh for this answer is a for this
answer is B don't read that okay you
read check the answer then read a sort
of explanation understanding explanation
has to be done that understanding
explanation is content rating and I feel
like most of the student they feel
content rating is reading synopsis okay
reading synopsis is not content reading
reading a proper explanation to question
is also a Content
reading is it necessary to
do dental
pulse that that is I have given you the
schedule whatever you want to include in
the schedule you decide okay you decide
okay so it it basing upon the scores
like like for example people who are
already hitting that 700s 750s
their mode of approach they have a
clearcut plan that I'm more worried
about the people who are in the range of
300 to 500 so I want to kick those 300
to 500 to a range of 400 to 600 or to a
range of 450 to
650 need question paper will be easy no
need to worry don't need to analyze the
difficulty of the question paper now
March 18th after exam we'll talk about
what is the difficult aspect like you
see like whatever scores you are getting
in the mock exams here you're going to
get the same average score plus 10 extra
in the neat Need that's what I
personally see in more than 60 to 70% of
the students for example you getting a
score of 500 here 500 regularly you're
getting a score scores of 500s so you in
the final exam you're going to get 500
plus 10 extra questions 10 extra
questions and this happens in more than
60% to 65 percentage of the students
means 500 plus 10 right aners is 50 plus
so it's going to be your scores are 500
here you're going to get a range of 500
to 550 plus and this happens for more
than 60% of the
students sir can we skip subjects which
are difficult to remember so there will
be chance of getting less negative
marking con concept I have discussed in
the last Instagram video the link will
be posted please do check that that is
that's a very logical explanation very
sweet and simple explanation I have
given so please do people who has missed
it please go back and please do check
that uh check that part just a
second
okay um the next
one how many questions we
must how many questions we must do to
get a good rank a this is also discussed
in the last Instagram very clearly I
have discussed this link will be posted
you can personally ping me after the
session I'll post you the link of the
Instagram live you can check it
off you have mentioned recent question
papers are posted on the website in
which folder do you we find the recent
sorry for this okay the recent questions
are posted in the mock okay in the mock
Dropbox you have 20 NE 2018 that is 2018
question paper NE 2019 2020 21 22 will
be present in four to five parts and 23
will be presenting four to five parts
please finish it it's getting
late the question we feel uh the
question should we do it in the first
room the question the questions which we
feel 50 to 50 we should do it no that
that you can keep it keep it in the
review you have an option like you keep
it in the review the review will have a
different color coding questions which
you feel 5050 they require more time to
think and lock the answer that's what
I'm telling now you have 20 20 mock
exams are there you can decide what
pattern of uh uh uh what pattern of
doing you can do you can decide by
giving 20 Mark exams no special because
most of the institutes they hardly have
10 mock exams only okay we have double
when compared to any other Institute in
the country very few institutes are
keeping more mock exams for the students
so you have more mock exams here so when
you're giving only five mock exams going
for an exam then you require all these
strategies but once we're giving like
four modules 20 mock exams and I'm
thinking to keep four or five extra
exams filled with lots of repeats so
once you're exposed to 25 mock exams
plus four modules almost 30 mock exams
along with uh seven years of old
question papers which you can give an
exam I don't feel all these strategies
are required really
required sir analysis of question paper
after
exam okay okay I'll do that how many
percentage of easy questions moderate
questions and
tricky question any question can be easy
to me
so I'm talking about repeats if you do
last seven years half of your question
paper will will be from last seven years
topics
only how to analyze mock tests after
writing every concept should be read
clearly or we should have to go through
the question you have to be clear about
the concept Concept in the sense like
Let Let It Be A classification or let it
be a table based question let it be for
example they're asking an apexification
question you should know when you have
to do apexogenesis you should know when
you have to do revascularization you
should know when you have to do RCT you
should know when you have to do direct
pulp cing when you have to do indirect
pul cing that is the concept related to
that L you can ping me on
the on the WhatsApp I'll help
you for revising all the mocks and mock
exams module exams in the website we
will have have access till March yes
you'll have access till
March and once you enter into the exam
your account will be deactivated can you
please upload all the picture based
questions in a separate session not
possible yeah not
possible all all pictures which are
going to come on in the examination were
already there on your WhatsApp okay so
in
WhatsApp guys I want you to respond on
the chat box in WhatsApp you have one
option like media right you have one
option media media option is there you
can click on MDS conquer one media
option will be there click on the media
option go into media all
photographs from last year to this year
will be there simple simple revision
okay one one technique anyone doing that
click on the media all voice notes will
be there all photographs will be there
all photographs you can scroll and you
can revise whenever you want not an
issue second one
is in WhatsApp like for example before
you're posting a doubt or you feel like
something is important you in WhatsApp
you have a search button option okay you
open WhatsApp all of you can open
WhatsApp I'll show you that easy very
easy very simple very simple world is
very
simple we don't have such such sorts of
preparation I had to open book for
everything when I was reading okay
second thing in WhatsApp you have a
search option so on the search button
you can press the keyword for example
you want some content related to syphus
press the keyword syphus so all whatever
discussions I have taken on syphus will
be coming if you press the keyword
cus ah such option was available on the
website previously because of which
website is
stucking that's why we removed the
search option not possible the website
uh the website developer said we can't
handle your students because they're
searching something which is not
available out there
okay you can use search button on the
WhatsApp you can use media on the
WhatsApp where everything can be done
that's the simplest
way
will you post rank lists for mock no I
will not post
sorry now I don't want to discourage
anyone leave about encouragement I don't
want to discourage anyone you're getting
your rank right so focus on your
rank negative marking
link as of now I have posted six times
on the group again I'll will be posting
M you can personally ping me I'll post
you personally because if if I post
something on the Instagram something on
your WhatsApp you don't feel that is
important for you so please personally
ping me I'll be posting personally to
you not on the group anymore because it
I think it was posted more than six to
eight
times yes analysis will take time but
analysis will pay you back okay nothing
wrong even if you spend more time don't
worry spend SP spend some quality of
time with the question paper what you
have given because question paper what
you have done is going to give you score
in the final
exam I'm not talking about the media on
the website here I'm talking about the
media on the WhatsApp I'm talking search
button on the WhatsApp media on the
WhatsApp not on the website I cannot
give access to the media on the website
sorry
check out the status even window button
also I have to tell what is
this don't worry your friends will tell
you window button when is the window
button yeah I don't I'm not following up
all the
cases T try to maintain 500 600 plus
score that is going to be comfortable
score in the
exam check out check out NB okay NB
website is there right with your logins
and everything they'll give the exact
date when's the when when is the window
button is going to open and
everything
anymore main reason why I have not
conducted Instagram live there are very
so many students asking about
postponement of exam Supreme Court
case extension of
internship that is not topic of my
discussion there are many other people
who are doing that so I'm not at all
involved in that so I'm more involved in
in guiding you teaching you and giving
you the basic push required for the
prep anything more shall we close the
session for
now focus on the preparation here okay
leave about all this uh uh I'm not
telling these are unnecessary what I'm
telling is this happens every year okay
you may be fresh for this okay so I'm
seeing this from past time years I'm fed
up and bored of this okay so what I have
analyzed in the last 10 years
is even if the application form is open
for the for the eligibility criteria or
something the thing is they have to read
they don't have time to read first of
all along with fighting also along with
fighting waiting for the Supreme Court
result doing all this nonsense they have
to read then only they will get a seat
then then whatever extensions are done
whatever the cases doesn't make any
sense if you don't get a rank try to be
logical I'm more logical I'm seeing this
from past 10
years anything
more how to maintain or adapt fastness
during reading or
Preparation how can I tell come on how
can I tell you keep on turn that's what
I'm telling I'm telling do mcqs do McQ
McQ Plus
some sort of content related to the McQ
this is fast reading no one will will
take 100% no one will take one hour to
read an McQ how much time it will okay
read the McQ and options it will take
hardly one minute so in one minute
you're reading McQ understanding the
answer then the content you may read for
two to three minutes so in the 3 minutes
you are reading one concept or in five
minutes you're reading one concept so in
one hour you will read some 20 to 25
Concepts so this is the fast mode of
reading this is what I'm stressing you
guys from the last 30 to 40 days there
is like you you open a you open a
Content you open a synopsis I cannot
tell you how to read fast whatever
method I'm telling is a fast reading
method only I'm I'm asking you to focus
more on the McQ part more on the McQ and
the content Reading
part anything more shall we close for
now
done done anything
more try to try to decrease the personal
uh uh I mean the personal content
oriented stuff uh on on the WhatsApp
chat box which is killing your time as
well as my time so most of the doubts
and everything I tried my best to
address address you and personal request
okay uh from my side is yes I am I'm
more oriented towards this and I don't
want want to skip any message that is
being posted to me on my chat box
whether it's a conquer student or
whether it's a non-c conquer student
okay so this is a hardcore principle
that I have
adapted from my uh first year of MDS
conquer till this this year of MDS
Congress so a personal request you don't
show your frustration on Preparation on
the mentors okay I have been seeing this
in this Young Generation you're you're
frustrated of something which is nowhere
related to the PR or something don't
show that frustration on the persons who
are helping you that's a kind request
for all of you ex exceptionally MDS
conquer students because I can ignore uh
non-c conquer students but I cannot
ignore conquer students because at the
end of end of the day we are all a
family right so I'm getting this
constant complaint from so many mentors
that that the students were so
frustrated and they're showing their
frustration on the mentors which is not
at all fair according to me okay it's
okay like you you it's okay that you are
in a very difficult situation accepted
but everything has a limitation right so
the
reciprocation uh you you have to give
back to the mentors and mentors will try
to help you out okay the only person who
can help you in this situation is a good
Mentor can help you okay and MDS conquer
is not an app based preparation I can
openly tell that it's not an app based
preparation you see you check it off how
many Abbas preparation mentors are
coming and talking with you guys any
response for this is there any app based
Mentor coming very frequently talking
with you on live or messaging your your
concerns your doubts personally because
I see like I know that most of you guys
are part of other apps also no I I know
this I know this because I suffered
during my preparation and I started MDS
conquer with a dream that no one should
suffer in their preparation because of

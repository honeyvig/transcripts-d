hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will learn
about asp.net core mvc
let's look at today's agenda
we shall begin with understanding what
is mvc pattern
then we will see what is asp.net core
mvc
followed by which we will look at the
functions of mvc
and then understand the different
components of asp.net core mvc finally
we have a demo wherein we will build our
first asp.net core mvc application
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn so
without wasting any further time let's
get started
what is mvc pattern
the model view controller mvc
architectural pattern divides an
application into three major component
groups
model view and controller
the principle behind developing mvc is
the separation of concerns
this principle implies that software
should be classified based on the type
of task it performs
separation ensures that the business
model is simple to test and can change
without becoming too involved in low
level implementation details
using this mvc pattern user requests are
routed to a controller who is in charge
of interacting with the model to conduct
user actions and receive query results
the controller selects the view to be
displayed to the user and supplies it
with any model data it requires
what is asp.net core mvc
the asp.net core mvc framework is a
lightweight open source and highly
testable presentation framework designed
specifically for use with asp.net core
asp.net core mvc is an application
framework that allows you to create
modern web apps by using the mvc model
view controller architectural pattern
asp.net core mvc provides a pattern
based approach to developing dynamic
websites that allow for a clear
separation of concerns
it allows you to complete markup control
facilitates td-friendly development and
corresponds to the most recent web
standards
functions of mvc
let's look at the model functions the
responsibilities that a model carries
in an mvc application the model
represents the application's state and
any other business logic or activities
that should be executed by it
business logic and any implementation
logic for maintaining the applications
state should be wrapped in the model
viewmodel classes intend to contain the
data to display on that view are often
used in strong type views
the model is used by the controller to
construct and populate this view model
instances
view responsibilities
views are in charge of displaying
content through the user interface
they embed dotnet code in html markup
using the razer view engine
view should have minimal logic and any
logic should be related to presenting
content consider using a view component
view model or view template to simplify
the view if you need to perform a logic
in view files to display data from a
complex model
now let us look at the functions of a
controller
controllers are the components that
manage user input interact with the
model and finally choose which view to
render
the view just displays information in an
mvc application
the controller processes and responds to
the user input and interaction
the controller is the initial entry
point in the mvc architecture and it is
responsible for deciding which model
type to interact with and which view to
represent
hence its name is controller as it
responds to a given request
now let us look at the components of
asp.net mvc
some of the components of mvc are
routing
model binding
model validation
dependency injection
filters and
areas
now let us look at them one by one
at first we have routing
asp.net core mvc is built on top of
asp.net core routing a robust url
mapping component that enables the
creation of applications with logical
and searchable urls
this allows us to establish url naming
patterns for applications that perform
well for search engine optimization and
link generation regardless of how the
files on your web server are arranged
routes can be defined with a simple
route template syntax that takes into
account route value limitations defaults
and optional values
next we have model binding
model binding in asp.net core mbc
transforms client request such as form
values route data query string
parameters and http headers
it transform this data into objects that
the controller can handle
as a result
the controller logic does not have to do
the job of determining the incoming
request data instead the data is passed
as parameters to its action methods
next we have model validation
validation is supported in asp.net core
mvc by decorating your model object with
data annotation validation attributes
before values are sent to the server the
validation attributes are checked on the
client side the framework validates
request data on both the client and the
server side
dependency injection
asp.net core includes dependency
injection capabilities
controllers in asp.net core mvc can
request required services through their
constructors
allowing them to follow to the explicit
dependencies principle
dependency injection is a software
design technique that achieves inversion
of control between classes and their
dependencies
filters
filters in asp.net core enable code to
be executed before or after particular
stages of the request processing
pipeline
filters can be used as attributes on
controllers or actions
filters manage duties such as
authorization restricting unauthorized
access to resources and response caching
filters allow for the execution of
custom pre and post processing logic for
action methods and they may be see to
run at certain points in the execution
pipeline for given request
last we have areas
areas allow you to divide a large
asp.net core mvc web app into smaller
functional groups
an area is an mvc structure that exists
between an application
logical components such as model
controller and view are kept in separate
folders in an mvc project and mvc uses
naming conventions to build a
relationship between these components
it may be good to partition a large app
into different high-level functional
regions
for example consider an e-commerce app
with numerous business units such as
checkout billing and search among others
each of this unit has its own set of
logical component views controllers and
models
now let us look at the demo in this demo
we will create our first asp.net core
mvc application
so first we need to install the required
software and set up the system for
asp.net core mvc development firstly we
need dot net core sdk software
development kit then we need to install
the sql server and then we need to
install editor like visual studio
once you have installed the visual
studio click on launch
visual studio 2019 is getting opened
so this is how the visual studio 2019
looks like
towards the left hand side we have the
recent applications which we have worked
on and towards the right side we have
the options to clone a repository to
open a project or a solution to open a
local folder or create a new project so
click on create a new project
here we have different project templates
we have console application which is
used for creating a command line
application that can run on.net core
windows linux and mac os
similarly we have other templates like
asp.net core web app blazer web assembly
app and if you scroll down you have many
more templates
but for this project we need the
template asp.net core web app model view
controller
since this project this video is related
to mvc we need this template so select
this template this template basically is
used for creating an asp.net core
application
with asp.net core mvc
model view and controller
so select this
click on next
if the project name so we'll enter it as
a demo since we are showing a demo
so enter the project name demo if you
want the solution name to be different
from the project name then check this
box and provide the solution name
so we'll keep it as it is
click on next
select the target framework
authentication type if required
then click on create
here you go
the project is successfully created
so here you can see there are different
types of files and folders
for this template the addition of
folders is the controller
model and view so these three folders
are added for this particular template
mvc
you can check out our previous video on
asp.net code tutorial wherein i have
explained each of these folders in
detail
open views and in shared you can see
layout.cs.html
open this file
so let's click on run and see what is
the output
so click on run here you can see build
started
here you can see it is running on the
localhost server
so this is the project this is a
template
let us go back to the visual studio and
change this so this is where
you can change the title
from demo will change it to simply learn
[Laughter]
similarly if you want to change
the home or the privacy you can change
it here
this is where you modify all the setup
so well reset and click on run restart
so here you can see the demo is changed
to simply done
so this is how we get started with mvc
application from here you can modify all
this go back to the visual studio and
modify if you click on home this will
come back to the same home page
click on privacy
it shows this page
so this was about the template model b
controller
in the upcoming videos we will discuss
asp.net in more detail
so with that we have reached the end of
this video like and share it if you
found it interesting thank you for being
here keep learning and stay tuned

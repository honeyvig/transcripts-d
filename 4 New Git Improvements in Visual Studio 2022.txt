>> Everyone. Thank you
so much for joining
us as I share all of
the latest updates for
the Git tooling in 17.10GA as well
as the 17.11 preview releases.
Let's just jump into it.
I've got some changes that I've made
in this file and you can see that
by the green indicator here.
I'm ready to commit these changes.
Now, you might have seen in
previous releases we created this
AI generated commit message.
If I go ahead and give that a clip,
what that's going
to do is Copilot is
going to take a look at
all of the diffs that I've
generated in the set of changes
between my previous commit
and my current one.
It's going to describe
those changes.
Now we got a lot of feedback in
the previous release that
this description was
a little tube verbose and maybe
added some extra bullet
points that we didn't need.
We definitely took that feedback
cleaned up the front and gave you
better responses so that now you
have a clear title
and a description.
Now with those changes,
we actually increase the
amount of people that were
answering those suggestions
and finding them helpful,
so we're really proud
of that change.
I'll go ahead and commit that.
Then if I go ahead and push it,
what you'll see is
an info bar showing
up at the top coming in right
here and that's going to
let us know that we've
got this option to create
a pull request either in Visual
Studio or in the browser.
Now the create pull request
page is not brand new,
but we did make tons of
updates based off of
all of the feedback that
we got from the Team.
Now that we have the
new pull request page,
we're going to go
ahead and add a title.
You might have noticed a new update
here is that I was able to get
the template from my repo auto
populated in here and
these are going to be
the default templates from
either GitHub or Azure DevOps.
This allows me to be
consistent with my Team,
be compliant with my
Team's practices.
If for example, my team doesn't
have a template and I wanted
to get a first draft of my
pull request description,
make sure I did miss any changes
that are covered in
this pull request.
I could go ahead and use this AI
generated PR description which works
exactly the same as the
comment description
so it gives me a super
easy starting point when
I want to add that.
Finally, I can also create
these pull requests as
a draft and these were
another set of the
highest level feedback
that we got from the customers
when we created this feature.
Additionally, if you're
using Azure DevOps,
you'll see an additional area in
the related item section that
allows you to link those items
so that you don't have
to do that in the web.
I won't show that here because
this is a GitHub example but
keep that in mind that was another
highly requested feedback item.
Now I'm done creating
my pull request,
and I'll go ahead and I'll switch
branches to show you
another new example.
This feature is something
I'm really excited about.
If you're anything like me when
you create a pull request item,
it can be really annoying to
actually address those comments.
You have to open up Azure DevOps or
GitHub in the browser
and then you have
to map all of the locations of
those comments and
changes back to the code.
That is just a lot of time
taken switching context
between the two.
But now, you can see
this easy info bar
that says show comments in files.
If I click that, I
actually get to see
all of my pull request comments
directly in the editor.
This not only gives me the ability
to cut out that context switching,
but I get all of the benefits
of being in my favorite IDE.
For example, I'll share some
really quick editor tips
that are brand new.
I'll show you I can use
the new auto surround feature
that allows me to just
highlight a bit of
text and then click on the
quotation mark and that
surrounds that text with
the quotation and adds it on
the beginning and the end.
Previously, if I were to do that,
it would have erased the
text that I had highlighted.
This is a super quality
of life improvement.
Then if I finish those off,
I'll have addressed this comment by
my colleague that
mentioned that I didn't
use the correct quotations
and so it wasn't going
to render correctly.
Now I have that edit and I'm
ready to resolve that comment.
Now that I have
resolved that comment,
I can move on to my next one and it
looks like I had the
wrong png file here.
I'll go ahead and I'll update
that to be the correct file.
Now, I have quickly resolved and
acted on these two comments.
I didn't have to map
back and forth between
the comments in the
browser and in my editor.
The last thing I wanted to share is
an improvement to your
Git history flow.
For example, if folks didn't use
our handy commit sage feature,
they might not have included
enough context in their commit to
actually help you understand
what happened in a
given block of code.
If I go ahead and
open an example here,
now I'm in the commit details
view and code refactoring is
helpful to know what happened.
But if I don't want to go through
all of the different files,
I can actually click on this
explained button and
that's going to take
the same algorithm that we use to
grab all of the diffs
and describe those,
and give me a better
description including
references to the files that
change the lines that change so
that I can get a better overall view
and I don't have to go through
and understand exactly what happened
by looking through the
diffs by themselves.
This just gives me a
better overview and I get
more information than
I would have just
from the code commit
message by itself.
Those were all of the features
that I wanted to share.
Thank you so much for
joining us today.
I hope you found
some cool new Git tooling
features that you're
going to leverage in
your everyday workflows.

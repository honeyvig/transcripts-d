granulation tissue formation ap
endothelial migration of new cells

maturation of own number five lifecycle
of platelets is seven to ten days number

pressure cuff to 11a both systolic
pressure for 3 minutes that's it for
today's session guys all these points
discussed here are very important from
meet and ames point of view so keep on
revising them all the best thank you

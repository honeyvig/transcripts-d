hi everyone I am dr. Amrita patnik oral
and maxillofacial surgeon from the team
MDS conquer here is a 32 points video on
pareo new miracles prepared based on eat
as well as aims point of view now we
shall go ahead with our first point
thickness of the junction depth ileum
near the base of the sulcus is around 10
to 20 Celtic point number 2 length of
the junction depth helium is 0.25 to 1.3
5mm point number 3 histologic depth of
the gingival sulcus is around 1.8 mm
phone number for probing depth of
gingival sulcus is around 2 to 3 mm for
number 5 thickness of the pattern on the
ligament is around 0.15 to 0.38 mm for
number 6 sulcus depth in the primary
dentition is around 2.1 plus or minus
0.2 mm point number 7 distance between
the base of the sulcus and the alveolar
crest in healthy peritoneum is around 2
mm point number 8 distance between the
crest of the albula bone and the cej is
around 0.75 to 1.4 9 mm point number 9
distance between the ethical end of the
junction elect ilium and the crest of
the annulus is around 1.07 mm
[Music]
for number 10 thickness of the basal
lamina is around 300 to 400 Armstrong's
for number 11 thickness of the Ori
epithelium is around 0.2 to 0.3 mm for
number 12 thickness of the dental
cuticle is around 0.25 micrometers point
number 13 thickness of the a cellular
extrinsic fiber cementum is around 30 to
230 micrometers
point number 14 thickness of the a
cellular a fiberglass mentum is around 1
to 15 micrometers point number 15
thickness of the cellular mixed
stratified cementum is around 100 mm
micrometers point number 16 width of the
attached gingiva is around greatest at
the maxillary incisor region from 3.5 to
4 point 5 millimeters manda blood
incisor region it is 3.3 to 3.9
millimeters maxillary first premolars
agen it is 1.9 millimeters mandibular
first premolar region it is 1.8
millimeters for number 17 the disparity
between centric relation and centric
occlusion is 0 to 0.5 mm point number 18
the ideal thickness of the graft should
be around 1 to 1.5 mm point number 19
functional integration of the graph
occurs after 2 to 5 weeks that is 1
month for number 20 amount of g CF
secreted per day is around 0.5 to 2
point 4 ml for number 21 oxygen
coefficient of normal gingiva is around
1.6 plus of minus 0.3 7 point number 22
the diameter of the bristles are 0.2 mm
for soft 0.3 mm for medium 0.4 mm for
hard for number 23 total occlusion
points in dentition is around 138 point
number 24 total number of fillings
required for full mouth survey excluding
third molars is around 18 for number 25
the threshold level for surface
roughness above which bacterial addition
will be facilitated is around 0.2
micrometers
for number 26 effective radius of action
of bacteria in peritoneal disease to
cause alveolar bone desorption is around
1.5 to 2.5 mm point number 27 radius of
action is around 1.5 to 2.5 mm point
number 28
biological width is around 2.0 for mm
point number 29 width of the cementum
that is a cellular at the cervical third
is around 20 to 50 micrometers point
number 30 width of the cementum that
acellular at the apex is around 150 to
200 micrometers for number 31 width of
the marginal gingiva is around 1 mm for
number 32 width of the CDJ is around 2
to 3 micrometers

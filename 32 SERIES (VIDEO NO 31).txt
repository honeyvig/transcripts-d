hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss numerical sing oral
radiology point number one the tungsten
wire in cathode of x-ray machine is of
two millimeters in diameter and one
centimeter or less than one centimeter
in length point number two the atomic
number of tungsten target in annual is
74 point number three the melting point
of tungsten target in analyst 3000 for
22 degree centigrade point number four
the thermal conductivity of tungsten
target in analyst 173 Ward number five
the percentage of electron kinetic
energy converted into heat is 99 percent
number six the inclination of target in
inori's twenty degree point number seven
the actual focal spot size is 1 mm into
3mm number eight effective focal spot
size is 1 mm into 1mm number nine
filament transformer reduces the old age
of incoming alternating current of 10
volts number 10 the voltage of intraoral
panaroma cancer flow metric radiographs
is 60 to 90 kv p 7 for CB CT the voltage
is 90 to 120 kv p number 12 the typical
duty cycle is one is 260 that is 0.25
seconds exposure for every 15 seconds
point number 13 the inherent filtration
of most x-ray machines ranges from
equivalent of 0.5 to 2 mm of aluminum
whereas the total filtration should be
equivalent of 1.5 mm of aluminum for a
mission operating at up to 70 kv p
number 15 total filtration is 2.5 mm of
aluminum for more than 70 kV permissions
number 16 the coherent scattering is 7%
number 17 the photoelectric absorption
is 27 percent whereas the Compton
scattering is 57 percent
Bowen number 19 primary photons pass
through the patient tissues with no
interactions is nine percent point
number twenty one gray equal to hundred
radiations absorbed dose number twenty
one one civics is equal to hundred row
engine equivalent man number 22
approximately one third of biologic
effects of x-ray exposures result from
direct effects whereas two third of
biologic effects are from indirect
effects point number 24 this direct and
indirect effects are completed 10 power
minus 5 seconds
point number 25 the radiotherapy codes
includes total 60 to 70 gray that should
be given in six to seven weeks
number 26 after irradiation mucosal
healing complete by above two months
number twenty-seven of the irradiation
taste equity usually decreases by factor
thousand to ten thousand number 28 after
radiotherapy taste recovery takes place
in 60 to 120 days member 29 this
salivary flow may reach essentially zero
860 gray number 30 during radiotherapy
buffering capacity of this saliva
decreases by 44 percent number 31
radiation caries is seen with the doses
more than fatigued gray whereas
radiation caries is trounce if dose is
more than 60 gray that's it for today's
session guys hope you all know down
these points and prepare well thank you

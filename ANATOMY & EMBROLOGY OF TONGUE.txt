hi everyone this is dr. Marjorie from
Team MDS conquer so in this video I'm
going to discuss about the embryology
part of the time and also the anatomy of
the tunnel as all of us know that first
impression will be the best impression
to good scoring the examination you have
to start your answers with the contents
okay and this content should include the
interaction starting from the
interaction part to the references which
are given in the last of your answer so
going into the subject now as of all all
of us know this tongue is a muscular
organ which is situated in the floor of
the mouth and in the Latin it is it
means it is Linea whereas in Greek it
means their tongue means the glossa so
coming to the development of the time
this development of the tongue starts
from the 4th to 8th week of in dried
rhyme life and this development can be
summarized into two stages whereas in
the first stage you can see here all the
two sides of pharyngeal arches will
combine in the midline to form the floor
of the primitive pharynx so this is the
stage one whereas if you take the stage
two here you can see the tori spelling's
those are calls in lingual swellings and
their structure called as a tuberculoma
empath so these three structures are
formed in relation to the first arch and
there is an another structure called as
a hypo climb near eminence which is
formed in relation to the medial parts
of the third arch and therefore that and
you can see here that the fifth ass has
been disappeared so these two stages are
the important stages for the formation
of the tongue this whole slide
represents the origin of the tongue here
so these are the two swellings that is
they are called as a lingual swellings
and these two spellings are developed
from the medial most part of the
mandibular arches and this medial most
part of the mind
our cell proliferate and you rise to
this lingual swellings and there is an
another structure called as a tuber
killer in Pontus tubercular impart will
separate these two lingual swellings and
you can see here one word depression is
present behind this or below the
tuberculin in parts this is nothing but
the epithelium between proliferate and
first form the thyroglossal duct and
this thyroglossal duct well form into a
depression called as a foramen cecum and
this foramen sneak comes or the
thyroglossal duct gives rise to the
thyroid gland and if you take the other
two swellings which are present in the
medial part they are called as cranial
part and cordon part of the hypo
bronchial eminence and this hypo granule
eminence has this two parts like cranial
part and coral part from this coral part
epiglottis is developed whereas the
cranial part is involved in the
formation of that time so actually this
further development this tang is grouped
into three parts
that is anterior 2/3 of the tongue
posterior one-third of the tongue and
the posterior most of the time so we
will study the development of the tongue
in these three parts if you take the
anterior 2/3 of the tongue it is
developed from the fusion of two tuber
lingual swellings and when the tuber
coming in part so these three will fuse
and form the anterior 2/3 of the tongue
whereas if you take the posterior
one-third of the tongue it is developed
from the cranial part of the hypo
granule
eminence and if you take the posterior
most part of the tongue it is developed
from the fourth arch so this anterior
2/3 is developed from the mind blur arch
whereas
posterior one-third of the tongue is
developed from the third arts this is
first arch whereas posterior most is
developed from the fourth ash so here
the second arch is missing right so this
second arc you can see in this picture
the second art is buried under the third
arts hence it is not involved in the
formation of the tongue
the first ads but anterior 2/3 third
arts posterior one-third and the fourth
and posterior most part of the time is
formed and remember one thing in
representing the answer should be in the
diagrammatic way or the flowchart way so
that it will fetch you more marks an
exam so this table is the summary of the
components so you can see here this all
the summary where which is first hatched
from the anterior 2/3 third acts
posterior one-third and fourth arch
posterior most and occipital microns
news rise to the muscle and these are
the nerve supply we will go we'll see in
the next slides coming to the anatomy of
the tongue this tongue actually has the
three parts okay
the this root body and tip whereas two
surfaces that is dorsal surface in the
ventral surface if you take the ventral
surface it is confined only to the oral
cavity whereas this dorsal surface will
have the oral cavity part that is called
as oral part and the other part is
called as a pharyngeal part so in this
diagram you can see this root of the
tongue it this is the root of the tongue
which is attached to the mandible and
the hyoid bone so this tongue is
attached to the mandible and the hyoid
bone and the superior surface that is
anterior 2/3 of the tongue you can see
here it is in a horizontal direction
whereas the posterior part of the
posterior one-third or the pharyngeal
part is oriented in a vertical plane see
the server it is oriented in a vertical
plane and there is a structure called a
sulcus terminalis which is present or
which it will separate the pharyngeal
part from the basal I mean far apart in
the oral part and there is an other
structured kalus foramen secom where you
can see here it is the I mean it will
present at the apex of the sulcus
terminalis
coming to the histology part this is
Japan will be of like dealing with all
the papillae of the time so papillae of
the tongue if you take there are four
types of popular filiform Fani from
violet and the phony eight popular for
us the popular you have to write in
headings like a shape of the papilla
first you have to read shape of the
popular location of the popula and
whether the taste birds present or
absent so if you take the shape of this
filiform papillae
Vizsla conical shape and the location
mostly they are scattered over all over
the tongue and tastebuds are absent in
this field for partly whereas if you
take the fungiform papillae it is a
dome-shaped or a mushroom-shaped
tastebuds are present and here and this
for fungiform papillae moves he had
presented that i mean at the apex of the
tongue then you take the foliate
papillae or sorry valid papillae this
valid papillae are also blunt the
cylindrical shape and this are present
in front of this sulcus terminalis are
the foramen cecum and takes better
present in this palette family and the
last is the foliate papillae
and this foliate papillae will present
in the linear for like structures which
are presented in front of the palate or
gloss synthesis the Pareto claw slash
they're present in credit of this pellet
or glass slots on the sides of that time
so this is a papillae of the tongue
coming to the masses of the tongue so
this muscles of the tongue can be deal
with two things two types that is there
are a entrancing puzzles of the time and
also the extrinsic muscles of the tongue
and if the any muscle for any muscle you
have to write the insertion of the
muzzle origin of the muscle and the
function of them as we have to group
your answer into these three headings so
if you take the intrinsic masses their
superior longitudinal inferior
longitudinal transverse muscles and the
vertical muscles coming to the superior
longitudinal muscle is the superior this
is a superior longitudinal muscle where
this is from the origin is from the back
of the tongue and if
take the insertion of the tongue it will
insert into the margins of the tongue
okay then function is this it shortens
the tongue and it also curse the epics
and sides of the tongue then coming to
the inferior longitudinal muscle this
inferior longitudinal muscle is origin
originated from the root of the tongue
and also from the some part from the
hyoid bone and if you take the function
it will shortens the tongue it is uncle
suffix whereas if you take the superior
longitudinal it will curls
whereas it Unger's inferior wrong didn't
will uncurls the apex of the tongue
coming to the transverse muscle this
transverse muscle if you take it is
originated from the medium septum this
is the medium septum of the tongue and
it inserts into the later modules these
are the natural margins okay these
insert into the lateral margins of the
tongue function is if narrows and
elongate the tongue coming to the
vertical muscle this vertical muscle it
is originated from the dorsum of the
tongue and insertion into the ventral
part of the tongue this mental part and
function is it will flattens the tongue
and also while dense the tongue so those
are the intrinsic muscles coming to the
extrinsic muscles of the tongue these
are like genial glasses high-gloss stylo
glosses and palliative losses and these
are the functions of the extrinsic
muscles that is protrudes their tongue
retracts the tongue depresses the tongue
and also any waves at none so coming to
the genome losses this genie of glosses
this is the genial glosses muscle it
will originate in the superior mental
spine and inserts into the body of the
hyoid bone but if you take the function
it will help in the protrude of the
tongue that is anterior part and
depresses the central part of the song
so though it helps in both protrusion
and the depression then coming to the
hypoglossal muscle this hypo crosses
muscle will originate from the greater
horns of the hyoid bone and again it
inserts into the laterals
this is the lateral surfaces of the and
function is it will depresses that pan
then stylo crosses stylo closest muscle
will originate from the styloid process
and again it inserts into the lateral
parts of the tongue it will elevate and
retract the tongue and it can pull the
pull back the tongue superiorly also
coming to the Perito process muzzle this
Pareto gloss is muscle origins from the
here this is peloton aponeurosis whereas
again it inserts into the later parts of
path
remember all these muscles of the tongue
or paired muscles it is two one pair
trick all these muscles are tied and the
function is it will elevates the tongue
and depresses the soft palate coming to
the vascular supply of the tongue it can
be by these arteries that is lingual
artery you can see this lingual artery
is the main artery which is divided into
the dorsal lingual arteries which is
supplied to the dorsal part of the
tongue and also the sublingual artery
which will supply the lingual part and
also the submandibular gland and also a
deep lingual artery can be seen which
will see in at the base of the tongue
and the tip of the tongue so lingual
artery sublingual arteries dorsal
lingual artery sublingual artists and
deep lingual arteries can supply the if
you take the veins there is a dorsal
lingual vein which drains from the
dorsum and also the sides of the tongue
whereas deep lingual veins will drain at
tip of the tongue and join the
sublingual veins from the sub's lingual
salivary gland whereas all these veins
will terminate finally into the internal
jugular vein so the venous drainage of
the tongue then if you see the link
lymphatic drainage anterior part of the
tongue or the tip of the tongue into the
submental lymph nodes anterior
two-thirds of the tongue into the
submandibular lymph nodes posterior
one-third of the tongue into the
inferior deep cervical lymph nodes and
the posterior most part
the tongue into the superior deep
cervical image and remember this
lymphatic drainage is very important
because even in a carcinoma of the
tongue even the contralateral lymph
nodes can also be palpable if it is
affected on the right side then even the
left side that lymph node test can also
be palpable in this in this lymphatic
drainage of the time so this is the
nerve supply of the time which is given
on a import table so the taste anterior
2/3 with the chorda tympani posterior
one-third glossopharyngeal and posterior
most is Vegas if you take the sensory
part it is lingual part of trigeminal
now then posterior one-third is the
glossopharyngeal now and posterior most
part of the tongue will be the vagus
nerve and mota
thing is with this is very important
mirror on extrinsic and intrinsic muscle
except to the palate or glasses muscle
can be supplied by the hypoglossal nerve
whereas this palate or Lawson is
supplied by the cranial root of the SS
arena so this is the thing regarding no
supply so coming to the applied aspects
remember any answer which you are going
to answer the basic part should end with
the applied aspect which is important in
the speech examination so all this
Anatomy or embryology or physiology or
biochemistry histology or anything any
subject basic subject should end with
the applied aspects so here have
mentioned few applied aspect first you
can write first you can write how to you
examination of the tongue then you can
Romanian few tongue disorders and you
can mention what will happen if there is
injury to the hypoglossal now you can
write there will be of paralysis of the
tongue and the tongue is deviated toward
paralysis side and the paralysis of the
geno glosses muscle which will lead to
the abstraction of the airway and why
we'll give few drugs in the sublingual
way right so why these drugs are
important in the sublingual way because
they will have a more faster way of
penetration because of this all this
lineal vascular vascularity and you can
write about the
or pain and the pain which is before
from their tongue out from the other
part and you can include the time in the
taste pathway also because of this taste
but and you can write few special
investigation procedures like how the
tongue is investigated you can write you
can mention the radiological procedures
like MRI ultrasound or CT and you can
also mention few other in special
investigations like cinematography and
simi radiographic stay studies and also
the electromyography study because as a
tongue is a muscle where it can be
started by the electromyography also so
you can include few applied aspects at
the end of your answer which will fight
which will increase your score so at the
end you have to mention the references
that that is starting with the basic
references like your text to books and
you can include a one important article
which is you which you have been used in
your this thing applied aspects or
anything you can include the one
reference one article at the end and but
you mentioned all these important thing
is you have to include all the basic
text books like anatomy embryology part
and medicine part and the last thing is
you have to include one important
article which you have been used so
thank you everyone this is the important
nodes or something about the tongue i'm
important tips where you can fetch
increase which will increase your the
score in your examination thank you
everyone
stay happy i'm lower learning with MDS

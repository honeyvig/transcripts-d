without further delay let's get started
first we will get started with data
collection kind of self-explanatory it's
a process of gathering information from
various sources to build a data set for
analysis often it involves a collection
of broad data points now the next one is
data cleaning data cleaning deals with
literally the data cleansing process it
is all about identifying and correcting
errors or inconsistencies in data sets
to ensure accurate and reliable analysis
next after that is data science data
science is an umbrella under which the
data analysis comes in it is a broad
feied that encompasses the study of data
to extract insights patterns and
knowledge often utilizing statistical
and computational methods on the fourth
position is data transformation it is
the process process of converting raw
data into a more suitable format for
analysis making it easier to work with
and derive meaningful conclusions on the
fifth position we have data modeling
data modeling is all about creating a
visual representation or blueprint of
data structures and relationships to
understand and analyze complex data sets
effectively sixth one is data
integration it is the process of
combining data from different sources to
provide a unified view facilitating
comprehensive anal is and decision
making on the seventh position we have
data visualization presenting data in
graphical or visual formats such as
charts and graphs to Aid in
understanding patterns and Trends in t
eighth one is inferential statistics
utilizing a smaller sample of data to
make inferences or predictions about a
larger population and providing valuable
insights ninth one is probability
measuring the likelihood of an event
occurring a fundamental Concept in sta
statistics used to quantify uncertainty
in data analysis for example the people
who like to buy a certain item now the
hypothesis is on position a tentative
explanation or prediction that is tested
through experimentation or analysis to
validate its accuracy let's say you on a
YouTube channel and you have two
thumbnails and you want to know which
one of those is most important or most
working one which has the highest number
of CD that's when you run AP testing or
hypothesis testing and you can
understand which type of thumbnail is
most like by your users followed by that
we have correlation examining the
statistical relationship between two
variables to understand how changes in
one may affect the other now in the 12th
position we have regression analysis
assessing the strength and nature of the
relationship between dependent and
independent values in a data set 13th is
outliner a data point that significantly
de from the rest of the data set
potentially indicating errors or unique
occurrences on the 14th Place we have
time series analysis examining data
collected over time to identify patterns
Trends and make predictions about future
values is about time series analysis
15th one is AI and machine learning
leveraging algorithms and computational
models to enable machines to learn from
data and make predictions about the
explicit programming next one is
predictive modeling creating models that
forecast future outcomes based on
historical data aiding in decision
making and planning on the 17th place we
have clustering grouping similar items
or data points together based on shade
characteristics helping identify
patterns with data sets next one is
classification categorizing new data
based on patterns learn from past data
allowing for sorting and labeling of
information 19th one is data mining
which is about extracting valuable
patterns information or Knowledge from
large data sets often used to discover
hidden relationships and now we have
text mining analyzing and extracting
meaningful information from large
volumes of unstructured text Data
similar to summarizing a books key
points now on the 21st position we have
data warehousing so data warehousing is
about storing and managing large amounts
of data in a centralized repository
enhancing efficiency and facilitating
complex data stor
big data is on 22nd refers to massive
data sets that are beyond the capacity
of traditional data processing tools and
requires specialized rule for analysis
and then we have structured data which
is about where the information is
organized in a specific format under
named rows and columns like an Excel
spreadsheet and next is unstructured
data so it needs a predefined structure
such as text or multimedia files
requiring Advanced Techniques for
storage and Analysis and then comes
semi-structured data which is a
combination of both structured and
unstructured data sets on the 26th
position we have data governance which
is about the framework and practices for
managing and ensuring High data Quality
Security and compliance within an
organization and next is 27th which is
about data privacy safeguarding personal
information in data sets ensuring secure
handling and compliance with privacy
laws 28th is data secure it measures
taken to protect data from unauthorized
access ensuring confidentiality
integrity and availability is all about
data security and on the 29th position
we have ATL which stands for extract
transform and load the process of
extracting data from various sources
transforming it into a consistent format
and loading it to our destination for
analysis is ETL and on the 30th position
we have data Mars which is about the
subset of a data warehouse designed for
specific business business units or
departments providing tailored data sets
focused analysis and on 31st position we
have data L large storage systems that
hold raw unprocessed data in its
original format facilitating diverse and
complex analysis 32nd is about data
pipeline a set of processes for moving
and transforming data from source to
destination ensuring efficient data flow
is all about data Pipeline on the 33rd
position we have data schema which
happens need to be a blueprint
illustrating how data is organized and
structured Aken to floor plan for
database design and on 34th position we
have normalization organizing a database
to reduce redundancy and dependency
enhancing efficiency and minimizing data
anamaly is all about normalization and
normalization is a concept of SQL so
next is SQL a programming language for
managing and querying a relational
databases providing a standardized way
to interact with data and now the no SQL
is on the 36th place a type of database
management system that handles various
data types and structures not limited to
traditional tabular relations next is
primary key a unique identifier each
record in a database table ensuring data
integrity and supporting relational
database design and on the 38th position
is foreign key a field that links to the
primary key in another table
establishing relationships between
different tables in a relational
database and 39th is indexing which is
creating an index to speed up data
retrieval in a database improving query
performance by providing quick access to
specific data on the 40th position we
have business intelligence using data
analysis tools and processes to convert
raw data into actionable insights for
informed decision making 41 is is
dashboard a visual display presenting
key performance indicators and other
relevant data in a centralized location
offering for a quick overview for
decision
makers and on the 42nd position we have
charts and graphs visual representations
of data such as bar graphs or line
graphs used to convey information and
Trends in a easily understandable format
43rd is about kpi quantifiable metrics
reflecting the performance of an
organization or specific activities
crucial for addressing or assessing
progress towards goals now on the 44th
position we have a k which is about
specific areas with an organization
where positive outcomes directly
contribute to the achievement of its
goals and objectives and 45th is about
realtime analysis which is about
analyzing data as it is generated
providing immediate results and insights
and enabling quick decision making based
on the most current information and now
we have 46th as data wrangling which is
a process of cleaning transforming and
organizing raw data into a format

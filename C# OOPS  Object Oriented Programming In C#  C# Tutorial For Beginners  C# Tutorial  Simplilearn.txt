hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel today we will talk about
one of the fascinating topics that is
the object-oriented programming in c
sharp but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek and a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without any
further ado let's get started with the
agenda for today's session
first we will define the object oriented
programming in c sharp
following that we will discuss the
differences between object oriented
programming approach and procedural
programming approach
later we will look into object oriented
programming in csha last but not least
we will discuss the benefits of
object-oriented programming in sesia so
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with our
first topic
that is understanding the concept of
procedural programming so what exactly
is procedural programming procedural
programming entails writing procedures
or methods that perform operations on
data
whereas object-oriented programming
entails creating objects that contain
both data and methods and encapsulated
together in one single object or a class
now a best example for precision
programming would be c programming
language
now let us understand what is object
oriented programming
object oriented programming is a
programming paradigm that organizes
software design around classes and
objects now let's take a look at what
classes and objects mean in
object-oriented programming in c sharp
classes are blueprints used to determine
an object's properties and behaviors
and objects are real-world entities with
their fundamental properties and
behaviors now let's look at a real world
example of classes and objects
so on my screen we have a car so this
particular car happens to be an object
so how can you define classes and
objects in c sharp using a car
so here you can see that i have a
blueprint of the same car
now blueprint is one single entity
and using this blueprint i can create n
number of cars which happens to be
objects
so here the blueprint of this car is
considered as a class and the cars
actual cars which are constructed or
built using the blueprint is called as
the object
so a class is the foundation of any
modern object-oriented programming
language in c sharp in oops languages it
is required to create a class to
represent data a class is a blueprint
for an object that contains variables
for storing data and methods or
functions for performing methods or
functions on that particular data
now that we have discussed the
fundamentals of a class and object let's
move ahead into the next concept
so each and every object that you create
will have its own variables and methods
that are used to manipulate the values
stored in the variables so here in this
particular example of car you can
consider the start drive and stop
methods which are involved in the object
functions
now let's move ahead into the next topic
that is understanding the four
fundamental principles of object
oriented programming concepts in c sharp
so basically object oriented programming
and repeat so basically object-oriented
programming in c sharp is categorized
into four fundamental principles the
first one being encapsulation followed
by that we have inheritance next we have
abstraction and finally we have
polymorphism now let us understand each
one of these concepts in detail
so first let's get started with
encapsulation in c sharp
so at first we have encapsulation
encapsulation is the process of
combining a data member and the method
into one single unit or class
encapsulation is the process of
enclosing something in a capsule that is
having an object-related operations and
data within that particular object
now let us have an example so one of the
most tangible examples of encapsulation
is a school back our books pen and other
belongings can be stored in our school
back
now to understand encapsulation in a
much better way let's go through a
practical example
so on my screen you can see an example
for encapsulation in this particular
example we are going to encapsulate the
methods for finding the area of the
given shape
so here we are considering the rectangle
shape so in this particular rectangle
application class you will have all the
get area functions which calculate the
area of a rectangle and also the
variables length and width so now let's
execute this program and see the output
so there you go the code has been
successfully executed and as you can see
we have provided the length and width of
this particular rectangle as 4.5 and 3.5
respectively and the area has been
calculated as 15.75
now
let us go through a simple exercise
now i have calculated the area of
rectangle how about you guys calculate
the area of square
maybe a circle as well
and a triangle
please try these exercises on your own
and let us know in the comment sections
below now let's move ahead into the next
concept of object oriented programming
with c sharp
so the next topic in object oriented
programming in c sharp is inheritance
so inheritance is a crucial concept in
c-sharp object-oriented programming
inheritance is a concept in which parent
and child classes are defined the child
class inherits the parent class methods
and properties but they can also change
the behavior of the methods if necessary
if required the child class can define
its own methods
here is a pictorial representation of
inheritance that shows a child class is
inheriting the properties from the
parent class or a derived class is
inheriting the properties of its base
class
now let's look at another example
inheritance is a mechanism by which a
child object acquires all the properties
of the parent class here you can see
that children are inheriting the
properties and behaviors of their
parents
now there are four different types of
inheritances available in seisha that is
single inheritance
multi-level inheritance
hierarchical inheritance and lastly
multiple inheritance as you can see in
single inheritance we have one base
class or the parent class and one child
class or the derived class the
properties and methods of a are been
inherited by b
in one single stage and similarly when
you come across multi-level inheritance
you have three classes a being the
parent class and b being the child of a
class and c being the child class of
both a and b here c can inherit the
properties of both a and b classes
in the third type which is the
hierarchical inheritance
multiple child classes acquire the
properties and behavior of one single
parent in the last inheritance type that
is the multiple inheritance
one child class can derive or inherit
the properties of multiple parents here
the child class d is inheriting the
properties of a b and c pairing classes
now with that let's go ahead and
understand each one of them in detail
so as discussed single inheritance is
defined as
having one base class and one derived
class
and similarly multi-level inheritance is
when one class inherits another and that
particular class is also inherited by
another parent class you can see c is
inheriting properties from b and b is
inheriting properties from a c can also
inherit properties from a as well by a b
now let's understand the third one that
is the hierarchical inheritance
this is the type of inheritance in which
multiple classes are derived from single
base class when a single class feature
is required by multiple classes this
type of inheritance is used
now at last we have the multiple
inheritance
multiple inheritance occurs when one
derived class or child class accesses a
property of its multiple parent or base
classes
now to understand inheritance in a much
better way let's try to execute an
example based on inheritance
now on my screen you can see an example
for inheritance
here we have a parent class that is the
vehicle so this particular class has one
method that is honking function
now the child class happens to be a
program called car and this particular
program will execute the methods which
are being derived from its parent class
that is honking
here you can see the object created
using the child class is executing the
method honked from its parent class now
let's try to execute this simple program
and see how it works
now you can see that the program got
successfully executed and it is
executing the two tooth function that is
honking function
now that you have understood the
fundamentals of inheritance
this is one simple exercise for you
where you try to execute the single
inheritance
multi-level inheritance
multiple inheritance
and hierarchical inheritance
don't worry if you run into some issues
while executing the code feel free to
write us down in the comment section
below and our team of experts will be
happy to resolve all your queries if
required for learning purposes we will
also send the code we have for all these
examples and also exercises
now with that we have finished the
second part of object-oriented
programming in c
now let's continue with the next one
that is the process of abstraction
so data abstraction is a process of
displaying the necessary information
abstraction is the process of showing
only essential features of an object to
the outside world while hiding the other
irrelevant information according to a
proper definition
in a nutshell abstraction is a process
of representing the essential feature
without representing the background
details
abstraction allows you to concentrate
only on what the object does rather than
how it does by providing relevant
information abstraction offers a
generalized view of your classes or
objects
now abstraction is a process of
concealing an object's working style
while understandingly displaying its
information
now to understand abstraction in a much
better way let's go through this example
where we have a coffee machine an
example of extraction is making coffee
with the coffee machine to make coffee
you must learn how to use coffee machine
you must simply supply water and coffee
beans and turn it on and choose the type
of coffee you want you are least
bothered about how the coffee machine is
functioning to prepare your coffee all
you care about is your coffee
so that's how abstraction works in real
time now let's go through a practical
demonstration of abstraction in visual
studio using c sharp
so in this particular example on my
screen you can see abstraction method
for animal
and in this particular class you can see
that the animal sound function and
animal sleep function are defined
now in the main class you can see that
we're just calling the animal sound
function and animal sleep function
now we are least spoiled about how the
function operates we are just worried
about the operationality of these
functions
now let's try to execute the simple
program and see an output
now you can see the code got
successfully executed and here we have
called the sleep function and sound
function of an animal called pig
now with this let's go ahead into the
next and last type of object oriented
concepts in c sharp that happens to be
polymorphism now the term polymorphism
refers to the presence of multiple forms
polymorphism is frequently expressed in
the object-oriented programming paradigm
as one interface multiple functions
polymorphism can be static or dynamic
the response to a function is determined
at compile time and static polymorphism
in dynamic polymorphism it is decided at
runtime now let us look at one real-life
example of polymorphism
here you can see one single person who
performs multiple tasks at one stage he
works as an employee for a company and
another stage he is a successful parent
and at the last stage he is also
performing some shopping
so here one person acts as an employee
at work father at home and a customer at
shopping malls this can be considered as
a decent example for polymorphism
now there are two different types of
polymorphisms the first one being static
or compile time polymorphism and the
second one being dynamic or runtime
polymorphism now let's look at these in
detail
so static polymorphism is exemplified by
method overloading method or function
has the same name but different
signatures while overloading it is also
known as compile time polymorphism
because the decision to call which
method is made at compile time
and the second type is the runtime
polymorphism late binding is another
term for dynamic or runtime polymorphism
the method name and signature are used
as number of parameters and parameter
type must be same and may have a
different implementation
dynamic polymorphism is demonstrated by
method overloading
now let's understand polymorphism in
detail using a practical example
so on my screen you can see an example
for method overloading or compile time
polymorphism in seisha so you can see
here we have edition function
right we have edition function written
two times with the same name as well but
there is one simple difference it is in
the signature so in the first add method
we have two parameters and in the
secondary method we have three
parameters
now c will decide which add method to be
called based on the number of parameters
you pass so here in the main function
you can see we are calling the first add
method by giving only two parameters so
c sharp will decide this particular add
method to be called based on the number
of parameters passed similarly the
second one it will decide i mean c-sharp
will decide that the second add method
will be called based on three parameters
that you have passed now let's try to
execute this and see the output
now you can see the program got
successfully executed and the output of
the numbers is also displayed here
now with that let's try to execute
another example based on polymorphism
but this time let us try to execute an
example for runtime polymorphism so on
my screen you have an example for
runtime polymorphism so we have one
function for drawing and calculating the
area of all the shapes
we have three different shapes that is
circle square and rectangle
now in the main function we are calling
the drawing function and also declining
the area function
so here c sharp decides which particular
function to be called or which
particular function that belongs to a
particular shape to be called based on
the runtime data it receives so all the
three different shapes have three
different formulae and three different
datas so according to the data provided
c sharp will decide which particular
function to be called in runtime now
let's try to execute this program and
see the output
now there you go the program got
successfully executed and all the areas
of three different shapes has been
calculated here
now with that we have come to the last
part of this c sharp oops tutorial that
is benefits of object oriented
programming in c sharp
so the first benefit of object oriented
programming in c sharp is
abstraction
so by using abstraction you can improve
the problem solving in an effective way
now the next one is inheritance so using
inheritance you have one major advantage
where you can reuse your code
followed by that you have encapsulation
so by using encapsulation you can find
troubleshooting to be easier
now the last one is polymorphism
so by using polymorphism you can add
flexibility to your code not just these
there are also much more benefits of
using object oriented programming using
c sharp now with that we have come to an
end of this tutorial if you have any
queries regarding any of the topics
covered in the session or if you need
the code that we have executed in this
particular tutorial or if you need help
or assistance during your exercises
discussed during this tutorial then

your queries until next time thank you

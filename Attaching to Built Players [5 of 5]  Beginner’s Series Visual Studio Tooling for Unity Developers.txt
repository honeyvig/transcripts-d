>> My name is Charles.
In this video, I'm going
to show you how to attach
the Visual Studio debugger
to your Unity Builds.
That way, you can fix bugs that only
appear on the devices that
your games actually run up.
Have you ever heard the phrase
"Works on my machine."?
It's pretty common amongst
programmers because
some bugs just don't show
up during development.
Dead PCs handle lots of
computationally heavy tasks,
so they tend to be pretty
high-end machines.
But the device that your
games actually run on,
the ones your player zone,
aren't always going to be that great.
Even the ones that do match
your specs can contain
hundreds of variables that all
affect the way your games run.
Luckily, for us, the debugger at
Visual Studio has the ability to
attach to instances of
your game that aren't
running in your editor.
As long as you've
built them correctly
and configured your
environment properly,
you can debug your games on
any device you want.
Let me show you how.
Here's a simple project
that you may recognize
from our other videos
in our debugger series.
It runs just fine on my editor,
but I'd like to see how it
fares on my low-end laptop.
I could just install Unity,
download the project, and run
it directly on my laptop.
But that wouldn't be a
true test of how the game
would actually perform in production.
To do that, we'll need to create
an actual build and
run it on the device
which we can do by clicking on
"File" then "Build Settings".
The Build Settings
window gives us tons of
control over how our games build.
We can add and remove scenes that
will be included in the build.
Choose the build's platform
and toggle a number
of options that will change
the way that build functions.
For the purposes of this video,
the option we're interested
in is development build.
Depending on the platform,
development build
will give you access
to a series of options that we
can use to profile and debug
our game once it's been built.
The only option we need to worry
about now is Script Debugging.
This option will allow us to connect
the Visual Studio
debugger to our build.
So let's go ahead and enable it now.
That's the only one we
need to enable for now.
Next, we'll click on
"Build" and choose a place
for our build to live.
Next, we need to transfer the build
to a device that we want to debug on.
For me, that's my laptop, so
I'll go ahead and do that now.
Just make sure that
whatever device you
use is accessible on your network.
That could be running it on
the same network or
that you've opened up
the necessary ports and configured
the firewall to allow
the debugger to connect,
but more on that later.
I've transferred the
builds to my laptop here.
Let's run it and move
the character to
a safe position so we can connect
the Visual Studio debugger.
Back on my dev machine,
I've opened our project
up in Visual Studio.
Let's set up a break point
we have something to debug.
I've been quite a few
changes to this class and
should probably confirm that
they still work in production.
Let's add break points at the
top of this function here.
It gets called fairly
frequently, so it will make for
a great test case for our
remote debugging process.
Now, we can start the debugger.
At this stage, we normally just click
the "Attach to Unity"
button and be ready to go.
But in this case,
we'll need to locate the running
build on our network until
Visual Studio to attach
to that instead.
To do that, first,
we need to expand the Debug menu,
and then click on
"Attached Unity Debugger".
This will give us a list of
all the Unity debugger instances that
our dead machine
currently has access to.
Each row displays the project
name, machine name, type,
player or editor, port, and finally,
some extra information which
sometimes contains the process ID.
If you don't see your
instance in this list,
you can just click on "Input IP" and
manually enter the IP address
of the device that's
running your build.
If you still don't see
your build in the list,
then Visual Studio probably
can't connect to it.
There are few reasons
why this happens,
but the most common is your firewall.
Firewalls are designed to protect
computers from malicious connections.
They do this by blocking traffic from
certain host and disallowing
connections on certain ports.
Unity's official documentation
has an entire page
dedicated to setting
up your environment
for remote debugging sessions.
If you encounter any issues,
I recommend reading through
the troubleshooting section
to help solve your problems.
However, once you do see
your build on the list,
all you have to do is select
it and Visual Studio will
automatically start the debugger.
Look at that.
The debugger has already pause
the execution of our
code on our break point,
and we have access to all of
the amazing features that are
available in the Visual
Studio debugger,
just as we'd expect,
and that's all there is to it.
When you finally build
and distribute your game,
there's no telling how
it will respond to
the large variety of devices that
your players will run it on.
However, when bugs do occur,
you can attach the debugger in
Visual Studio directly to the devices
that caused them or at
least the devices with
similar environments.
The best thing is, it
works the same way
across all Visual Studio projects.
Whether you're using Visual Studio,
Visual Studio for Mac,
or Visual Studio Code,
be sure to take advantage of these
powerful time-saving features.

hey everyone i am weber khandelwal and i
welcome you all to yet another exciting
video from simply learn
in this session we will be discussing
async and await in c-sharp
however before we begin this session
make sure that you have subscribed to
our youtube channel and clicked on the
bell icon below so you never miss an
update from simply learn
now let's look at the agenda for today's
topic
we shall begin our session with an
introduction to asynchronous programming
then we will discuss the need for
asynchronous programming
after that we will look into async and
await keyword
then we will look at the demo of async
and await
finally we will conclude this session
with differences between asynchronous
and sicros programming
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is asynchronous
programming
the application can work on other tasks
while waiting for the task to be
completed using asynchronous programming
asynchronous programming is very popular
in c-sharp thanks to the async and await
keyword
when dealing with the ui we use a
long-running method like reading a large
file or something similar
if any synchronous process is blocked
the entire application will be blocked
and our application will stop responding
until the task is completed
and if there is no await operator in the
async method then the method will
execute synchronously
now let's discuss the need for
asynchronous programming
in synchronous programming compilers run
one statement and wait for it to
complete and then move to the next one
whereas in asynchronous programming
compilers run one statement and while it
gets completed we will also work on the
next one
now we will discuss async and await
keywords
first up async keyword
asynchronous methods are created by
using async modifier on a method
an async method runs synchronously until
it reaches its first await operator
at which point it suspends
an async method runs synchronously until
it reaches its first await operator at
which point it suspend
next up
a wait
while the asynchronous operation is
running
this await operator suspend the async
method
when the asynchronous operation
completes the await operator returns the
result
and if there is no await operator in the
async method then the method will be
executed synchronously
next let's try it in the code editor
let's start by creating a class
class
program
we will create
a main function which will be static
void
main
string
args
then we will declare
method
1
and method
two
these will be the two method which we
will be calling simultaneously
then console
dot
read
key
now
let's create a asynctask method1 so
public
static
async
task
and method1
then we will call the await keyword
with task
dot
run
and we will include another
small bracket
and go out of it and equals to
with
greater than
in this we will declare a for loop
and
i equals to
zero
and we will run it 100 times
until
i plus plus
then we will print console
dot
writeline
method
one
is running
now we will add a delay
for this task
so
it will queue up
different tasks
we will give it 100 milliseconds of task
delay
so it will be finished in 100
milliseconds
and dot
wait
we will close this with the
semicolon
now
let's write
a public
method or two
repeat
now let's write
definition for method two
it will be a simple function
definition
so public static
void
method
two
a for loop
and
i
is equals to 0
i less than 25
i plus plus
console
dot write line
and we will print method
to
is running
and we will give it the task delay
of 100
dot wait
here the code will start with the
method1
when it will come to await task then it
will run this for loop and print
method one is running
and then it will trigger this delay
operation
when this delay operation will be
triggered it will stop for 100
millisecond while that time the method
two will be
executed because of the async property
now while this method two is working
when it will hit the avail method it
will again come back to the method
one now this method 2 is only running 25
times so after a point the method 2 will
stop running and then the method 1 will
work as normally let's try and run this
let's save first
as you can see
these methods are starting working
you can see that method 2 is running not
that simultaneously as method1 is
running
that's because the method 2 is low in
number
now let's get back to our slides
we have now discussed asynchronous
programming async and await keywords in
detail
now let's look at the differences
between asynchronous and synchronous
programming
first up
using asynchronous programming the
application can work on other tasks
without waiting for the task to be
completed
whereas the synchronous programming
allows us to run one task at a time
also the async modifier is used on a
method to create an asynchronous method
finally while the asynchronous operation
is running the await operator suspends
the async method evolution
and this was all for today's session

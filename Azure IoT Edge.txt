at Sandvik Coromant we use a sure IOT to
collect data in real time if you know
the temperature if you know the load if
you know the vibration if you have that
and can use that type of data you can
increase the efficiency or the machining
process generating savings while
customers of millions of dollars the
biggest challenges we're facing as the
rising costs of water compliance to
transform the way we farm we need a
trusted cloud platform that is as global
and local as our own industry the
software servers are connected to their
ergotism to the pumps 24/7 in that
remote access can be via any connected
device and I look at our flow meters and
sometimes the machine might be saving up
to 50% of its allocated will be used I
wouldn't go back with that
we wanted to make it really easy for our
customers to get meaning out of their
data
we took some existing technology and
ideas and modernize them with the help
of Microsoft the ability to find meaning
in that sea of data and use it to do
more than just react but plan ahead
before a problem occurs is what makes
this information valuable when we show
our customers what they can do with this
new technology and how fast they can do
it
jaws drop

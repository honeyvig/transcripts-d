in today's video we're gonna look at the
logic of a Fibonacci series program but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
so first let's understand what is
Fibonacci series
the Fibonacci series where each number
represents the sum of the two numbers
before it so here we have the series of
Fibonacci numbers
that is 0 1 1 2 3 5 and 8. so basically
what happened here is it adapts it two
numbers before it that means the number
represents the sum of the two numbers
before it so here we have the number 0
and 1. so initially they will add this
both numbers to 0 plus 1 is 1 then 1
plus 1 is 2 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 2 is 5 and
5 plus 3 is 8. so in this way it forms a
Fibonacci series so moving ahead let's
understand the program logic
so here as you can see we have a for
Loop so initially I value can be 0 and 1
then we are starting with the 2 so 2
the initial I value is 2 and then it
checks I less than number so whatever
number we are uh you know entering it
could be 5 10 so it checks with I value
so if 2 is less than that number then it
will execute this set of statements so
here N3 is equal to N1 plus N2 so
basically it add up the previous two
numbers and store it in entry and print
the entry value then whatever is there
in N2 will be assigned to N1 and
whatever is there in N3 will be assigned
to N2 so let's understand in Day by
executing this program
so this is the program on the Fibonacci
series
so here inside the main function here we
have declared the variables N1 N2 and N3
and we also have a variable I and number
so initially N1 is assigned to 0 and N2
is assigned to 1 the value 1. so enter
the number of terms here whatever the
number we are entering suppose we are
entering 5 or could be 10 so it will
find the 10 number of Fibonacci series
so
okay let's say we have entered 5 okay so
now num is equal to
num is equal to 5. then it will enter
the N1 and into so the I mean it will
print so initially N1 is 0 so it will
print the N1 value
N1 is 0 and then it will also print N2
which is 1.
so now N2 value is what 1.
so we have in uh N1 value as well as N2
value then coming to for Loop
we are starting I with 2 because we
already have 0 and 1 so we are starting
it with 2. so I is equal to 2 then
checks I less than num so what is I here
2 it checks whether 2 is less than the
number that we have entered that is 5.
if it's true then it will execute this
set of statements so what is our N1
value
N1 is 0
plus it will add N2 value that is 1
okay this is our N1 and N2 value so this
we are going to add and store it in N3
so now N3 is what
N3 is holding
value 1. and it will print the value
for entry the value will be printed as 1
and then coming back to this statement
here we have N1 is equal to N2 and then
into is equal to N3 so basically
whatever is there in into we are
assigning it to N1 so what is our into
value 1
previously N1 value was 0 now we are
assigning whatever is there in N2 to N1
so
now N1 is holding the value
1.
then
coming to the next statement here N2 is
equal to N3
what is n 2
before N2 was 1. now N3 is what 1 so N1
value is assigned to N2
so N2 is equal to 1. okay we got it then
again it will go to the go back to the
for loop as it has printed the N3 value
now again if you go back and increment
the I by 1. so now before I was 2 now I
is 3 so okay next time when it goes to
the follow-up it will increment I by 1
so now I is equal to 3 so it will check
whether 3 is less than 5 if s then we'll
come back to this statement and again it
will continue the same process that
means again it will
um add up these values N1 and in this
these values will be added up and 2 will
be stored in in the place of Entry there
will be 2 because it will add 1 plus 1
it is 2. so again N3 will be printed as
2 then again whatever is there in N2 is
given to N1 and whatever is there in N3
it is given to into and this will
continue till this whatever here is not
satisfied if suppose we reach 5. so 5
less than 5 it's false so it will stop
executing it will return
and print all the values so let's
execute it
foreign
enter the number of terms so suppose we
have entered five so here we got the
five Fibonacci series numbers that is 0
1 1 2 and 3. so suppose you want to
enter 10 so let's enter ten
or 15 let's enter 15. so as you can see
we got 15 numbers here Fibonacci series
all right so with this we have come to
the end of this session on Fibonacci
series in C I hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep

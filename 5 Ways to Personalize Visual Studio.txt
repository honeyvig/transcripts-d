>> On today's Visual Studio Toolbox,
Leslie shows us five cool ways
to personalize Visual Studio.
[MUSIC]
>> Hi, welcome to
Visual Studio Toolbox.
I'm your host Robert Green.
Joining me today is the
regular host of the show,
Leslie Richardson. Hi, Leslie.
>> Hi. I'm so excited
to be on the show. Wow.
>> I'm just so excited to have
you on the show as a guest.
>> Wow, I don't think I've
ever been on the show before.
This is exciting.
>> Rather than just
have you do the hosting
and the guesting and
asking yourself questions,
we're going to be on
the show together.
That's awesome. You're
going to show us
five ways to personalize
Visual Studio.
>> Yeah, I've got some hot tips
just based off of things
that I use regularly in
Visual Studio and also things that I
recently discovered that
I thought were really
cool and were worth showing off.
>> I think it's really
easy to just accept
the Visual Studio defaults and
never really noticed them,
but there's so many things
you can do to personalize it.
I'm excited to see these.
>> Yeah and these are super random.
My only thing is we're
actually not talking about
themes today because I thought
that would be too obvious.
But if you haven't used
Visual Studio themes,
definitely check it
out because there's
a lot of options on the marketplace.
But, yeah, so shall we dive on in?
>> Let's do it.
>> Awesome. I'm going
to share my screen.
Tip number 1, solution colors.
This is an extension actually that
good old Matts Kristensen
made pretty recently.
It's actually part of a larger
experiment to see if this may
someday get incorporated into
Visual Studio as an
integrated feature.
But I think it's really
nice especially if you
have multiple monitors or
multiple instances of Visual
Studio specifically that you're
hopping between that each
contain different solutions.
If you're like me, there have
been times where it's 2:00 AM.
Like I remember I was creating
a demo for Ignite last year
and I was going through between
two similarly name solutions.
I edited one having not realized
that I edited the wrong one.
I'm trying to debug my code
wondering why I haven't
my changes appeared in
the right solution.
It turns out, oh,
I just wasn't paying attention
to the correct instance.
As a way to help you out with that,
solution colors can come into play.
This is very similar to
colored tabs if you use those.
You can right-click on
a solution and then set
solution color and choose
a color of your choice.
I'm going to go with gold.
I also have another instance
open to show it off.
For this other solution
that I've got,
right-click and set solution
color. Pick a color.
>> Let's go mint.
>> All right, mint. What I
like is a bonuses when you hover
over and Window code bar you get.
I'd say you get little quick
indicators that don't involve having
to read at 2:00 AM telling
you what goes with what
and swapping between them.
It's just another
easy identifier when
you're hopping between multiple
instances of Visual Studio toolbox.
>> It primarily shows in
that line at the bottom.
Well, that's awesome.
>> It's pretty sleek. I had just
discovered this. Thank you, Matts.
>> What I do a lot is I
rewrite a lot of my demo app.
I have a XAML forms app and I'm
going to rewrite it in Maui.
All of the names are the same
because the code just
copies and pastes
over and then I'm constantly
confused which one it is.
They're both open in Visual Studio.
They're both named the same.
>> Yeah.
>> That'll be cool.
>> Life saver. We are
going to try that out.
It is an extension.
It's called Solution
Colors, I believe.
I think I have it up here somewhere.
>> Solution Colors.
>> Oh, yes. Yeah. That only wants.
>> Cool.
>> Thank you, Matts.
Cool. Tip number 2,
I'm cheating a bit because
it's multiple tips in one,
but there's so many ways
to customize tabs now.
It's ridiculous. I already
mentioned colored tabs.
If you want to do that or actually
let's use this example, Cod Apps.
You can go into Tools Options,
and you have a whole section
for tabs in Windows and
a lot of different ways
to customize from here.
If you check the
colorized document tabs
by option and then you can
choose how you want
your tabs to be colored either
by Project or File extension.
I'm going to stick with Project.
In this example, I have like
20-some projects
within the solutions.
As you can see, I've
got multiple colors.
Just a really nice indicator again,
especially if you're
like me and you've named
all of your files the same thing,
it can be a nice way
to be able to quickly
identify what goes with.
>> I use that a lot.
I have the XAML,
the.XAML file one color and the.
XAML.CS file at different color.
Because I have them all in the tab.
The XAML files are all on top,
the.CSes are on the bottom because,
they all have the same first name,
so I use that a lot
to separate those.
>> Awesome. That's
exactly what it's for.
Shout out to Grace and her
team. Grace is on the show.
Pretty recently, they put in
colored tabs a couple updates
ago, maybe over a year ago.
Time flies. Really cool.
Also what's really cool
are the different ways
that you can lay out your tabs.
We've got horizontal tabs by default
but you can also organize
them by vertical.
If I wanted to place the tabs on
the left, and I could do that.
Also if you have
colored tabs enabled,
it's great because it splits
them all up for you too.
>> That's cool.
>> But I prefer to keep things
horizontal so I'm going to
set mine back to horizontal.
What's even better than the
horizontal layout now is
that in the most recent
Visual Studio update,
I think so 173, I want to say,
you can have your tabs
in multiple rows.
How sweet is that? You don't have
to have your hidden
tabs hidden away.
If you want to see
everything all at once,
then you can do that.
>> Cool.
>> The possibilities are endless.
I'm going to swap back
to what I had before.
Tip number 3,
also related to the tabs.
But if you've ever had the
issue of having multiple
tabs open and you're choosing
the default tab layout,
it can sometimes be
difficult to tell which of
these open tabs is currently being
displayed on screen right now.
Now there is a new feature that was
also introduced in a recent update
>> What does it call? Showing
names not visible in italics.
You'll notice that are
in italicize and these
are the tabs that are
currently off screens
if I wanted to open
that and it can do
that. I love this.
If you want to enable it because
it's not set by default,
you can go and see Tools
Options back in the tabs in
Windows section and
it is here somewhere.
We show on visible tabs in
italic and tab drop-down
menu. When you want to.
>> Cool.
>> Sweet. Tip number 4,
we have got rainbow braces.
Sometimes when you're
going through your code,
it can be a little frustrating
trying to quickly identify
which bracket lines up with which
bracket or which brace
lines up with which brace.
Sometimes especially if you have
maybe a nested situation going on.
>> Isn't that what the
dashed lines are for though?
>> That is what the dashed lines
are forward to some degree.
But let's say you have the braces,
like the parentheses
that don't do that.
Sometimes you might have like
a nested function call
or something like that,
something that makes
it a little harder
to tell what brace goes with
which unless you move your
cursor directly in that section.
If you just want to quickly skim
through and make sure
you're on the right track,
there is another
extension that you can
check out called rainbow braces,
which was also created by Matts.
Thank you Matts. There's an
equivalent extension that's been in
the marketplace for a while that
does a similar thing
called Diaspora,
if that's how you pronounce it.
But I can just use my keyboard
shortcut "Shift Control 9."
You'll notice that all my braces and
parentheses have
been colored for me.
It's like a quick identifier
to know what's going on
with white without having
to constantly move my cursor
to the place in order to get
it highlighted by default.
>> Cool.
>> I like this one a lot
in those times where you
might forget a brace and yes,
you get the error message.
But sometimes it's just nice
to be able to cleanly tell.
>> Yet actually gives you
a nice set of glance,
gives you more information than
the dashed lines. I like that.
>> Totally. Last but not least,
the fifth tip that I've got for
you is custom window layouts.
I just found out about this
like a couple days ago,
didn't even know it existed,
but I think it's been
around for awhile.
That's usually how a
lot of Visual Studio
features go when it comes
to discoveries sometimes.
But this lets you save
your layout of your IDE
and then load it back up
when you feel like it.
To use it we are going to go into
window and save window layout.
I'm going to keep what I have here
and let's call this one The Norm.
While this doesn't
work for everything,
it works great for when
you want to customize
which windows are currently docked
or where they're positioned.
If you don't want certain
windows displayed, that thing.
Let's say I don't want
the Package Manager console
I'm going to close this out.
I'm going to move the Solution
Explorer to the left-hand side,
which I feel like I
should have anyway.
I'm left-handed and I find
it a lot more intuitive to
keep the Solution Explorer to the
left-hand side of the screen.
Then we're going to go into
window and I'm going to say
this window layout and I'm
going to call it The New Norm.
We're very inspired of names
here on individual video team.
Then from there you can go
load up your saved windows.
We go into apply window layout
which you also have
keyboard shortcuts.
I'm currently on The New Norm and go
back to The Norm and there it is.
>> Does that save your
open documents as well?
>> From what I understand,
it does not apply to
your Windows documents that
are currently opened
and stuff like that.
>> That could be
enlighten her enhancement
because then if you were
done for the day and you
are shutting down into
little studio which you
wanted to open up next time,
literally where you were
with all the files open,
actually even scroll
down to the same place.
>> Yeah.
>> That might be interesting.
>> It's pretty nice. And
you can also choose to
have one view where
the window is split,
looking at multiple paths at
the same time, you do that.
>> I think a lot of people have
their home multi
monitor view and then
their laptop on the road view or
different views for
different project types.
>> Yeah, I think really
cool because honestly
this is something that I
wanted to see NBS for a while.
Like I think this version could
stone use them work and
I'll probably be going over
to the deaf community and putting in
my own feature suggestions
as to how and this idea.
But, just having the ability
to provide custom experiences
that you can toggle between.
It's very similar to I
use Photoshop a lot,
so they have like by
default, custom workspaces.
Like here's the
photography workspace
or the graphic design workspace,
and then depending on
which one you click,
it gives you a related tools
and stuff Brenton Center,
and hides away the
ones that you may not
necessarily need for
that particular topics.
Would love to see this feature
utilized a lot more in the future.
>> Yeah so let's review.
We did five ways, what were they?
>> Yes, so we had solution colors.
Great. Government
wants to instances of
VS and you need to
differentiate between them,
especially if there are
multiple solutions.
We talked a lot about tabs,
so we've got Vertical Tabs,
colored tabs, being able to
Show Tabs and multiple rows.
Number 3, we had been able to
show your hidden tabs or italics.
We also have number 4,
which is Rainbow braces,
the ability to quickly
identify what Brazor,
which parentheses going with what,
and you can use.
This one requires an extension,
much like solution colors,
it's called rainbow braces on
the Visual Studio Marketplace.
Definitely check it
out, and number 5,
we talked about custom
window layouts.
>> Awesome, very cool.
>> Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
You discover something
every day even
though you work on
the product everyday.
>> Yeah. Obviously,
we'll have been in the product for
a longer summer brand new extension,
so there's so much going on.
>> Yeah.
>> That is cool.
Well, thanks for
coming on the show and
thanks for letting me host
the show to have you come on.
>> Thanks for having me maybe
I can come back sometime.
>> Maybe.
>> I will
>> We will work on
a five more ways to personalize
Visual Studio episode.
>> Awesome.
>> Awesome. I hope you
guys enjoyed that,
we will see you next time
on Visual Studio Toolbox.

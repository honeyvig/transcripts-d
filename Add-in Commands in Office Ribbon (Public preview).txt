hello my name is pratish Abraham I'm a
principal program manager on the Outlook
extensibility team in this video I'm
going to talk about Outlook add-in
commands and show you how easy it is to
build them in addition I'll cover new
features and capabilities including the
new outlook inclin store which is a
great way for users to discover and
acquire your added first let's do a
quick recap on Outlook add-in addin help
developer extend Outlook across
platforms using standard web
Technologies there are two main
components to an addin the XML manifest
that registers the addin with Outlook
and your HTML plus JavaScript code
that's running on your web servers
addins can communicate with Outlook
using a lightweight JavaScript library
called
office.js one of the key features of
Outlook add-ins is that you can write
the addin once and it runs everywhere be
it desktop outlook on Windows or Mac or
the Outlook client that runs on all the
major browsers including phone and
tablet depending on your scenario your
Adin May Target consumer or business
users as we support addins in Office 365
on premise exchange and
outlook.com by extending Outlook
functionality addins allow users to
complete their task quickly and help
them be more productive there are three
ways developers can extend Outlook today
in read compose or contextually notice
how the Salesforce addin lets the user
lookup CRM information it allows the
user to add new leads or opportunities
without ever having to leave Outlook
Boomerang and compose reminds you when
folks have not responded to your email
it is a great follow-up
scenario add in commands allow
developers to create their own buttons
directly on the native command surface
of office and in Outlook 2016 this is
the Outlook ribbon by doing so your
addin looks more native and it really
stands out to the user add-ins are
easily accessible and now your buttons
are just a click away we announced
add-in commands back in April and we
continue to update this model with more
capabilities such as the ability to
insert a menu as you can see in the
Emoji example below it's time to see
this in
action notice the add-in commands in my
Outlook 2016 client I can now launch the
Salesforce addin on the ribbon with just
one click I can see the CRM information
about the people and accounts associated
with this email let me switch over to
compose no is how Boomerang took
advantage of the many functionality I
can now choose one of the remind me
options and Boomerang updates the
infoboard letting me know that this
message will return in a week's time
it's time to build an addin command now
this demonstration uses Yen Yen is a
scaffolding tool for modern web apps in
this example I will use the Yan office
generator that builds all the
scaffolding I need to build an Outlook
addin command in addition it hosts the
add-in right off your Dev box so you can
try it out out an Outlook immediately I
have a slide in the end with all the
links to get started including these
yman steps and the GitHub add-in sample
that I will use shortly in this demo in
the interest of time I ran some of these
commands already but I will walk through
them the first step lets you install
yman the office generator and dependent
component called B now this will spew
out a bunch of text which I don't show
here the Second Step I created a folder
called demo add- in commands I then ran
the yman office generator I followed all
the default uh commands which then
generated all the code I needed for the
Outlook addin I then went to GitHub and
I downloaded the sample called command-
demo once I did that I copied all the
files and folders from the GitHub sample
into my scaffolding
folder once I did that I ran gulp server
static gulp basically starts the web
server this step basically run starts
the web server on Local Host
8443 running gulp will generate a self
signed certificate you can view the
certificate from your browser by
navigating to this URL please install
and Trust the certificate as all addin
must be hosted off an SSL
endpoint let's go to the management
interface you can go to the management
interface and NOA by clicking on the
gear icon and clicking on manage addin
you can see in manage addins I can
install add-ins a couple of ways one is
to install from the store the option I'm
going to pick is install from
file I will browse to the scaffolding
folder find my
manifest and install it this will upload
my manifest to my mabox Outlook will
check to see if syntactically everything
looks right and if so the addin is
installed in my mailbox let's go into
Outlook
now Outlook gets a notification whenever
a user or an admin has installed an
addin in my mailbox when it gets that
notification Outlook will uh refresh the
ribbon as you can see and these commands
automatically showed up on my ribbon if
I go into my compost uh surface you can
see that this sample creates a menu I
can choose one of the items in the menu
which creates some text and inserts it
into the body of the email it also
updates the info bar saying that it did
so successfully
let me resize the
ribbon you can see that I didn't have to
do any coding to handle uh the scaling
of my commands and my buttons and my
icons Outlook did all of that for me so
how did this all work I will go through
the Manifest as this is the most
important piece to understand the
Manifest provides a declarative way to
define ux and describes how your add-in
would show on the Outlook ribbon in
other words Outlook passes your manifest
XML and automatically creates creates
all the native ux for your buttons and
your
menus see how I defined a control here
which is of type button on the composed
command surface the button has a set of
icons and it has an action associated
with it the action type is execute
function the function name here is ADD
default message to body this function is
defined in this function
file the second control is of type menu
as you can see
as you know menu has a set of items
associated with it the first item also
is of type is has an action whose type
is execute
function the second item in the menu um
is of type show task pane what that
means is when you click on item number
two in this menu it launches this task
pain from this
URL Below in this manifest you can see
all the resource definitions for the
names of your buttons over here as well
as the URL to your icons and the URLs to
your task Pane and function
file let's take a quick look at the code
see home.js under the app compos
folder using office.js I'm able to
navigate to the item body object and
call the method set selected data async
this inserts text at the selected cursor
you can see it takes two parameters the
text to insert and a ction parameter
which lets me specify if I want to
insert it as text or
HTML since this function uh is an async
routine the call back method lets me
know if the operation succeeded and if
so it writes to that info bar saying the
message was inserted
successfully so what else is new I'm
happy to announce that add-in commands
is coming soon to Outlook 2013 you can
see that the Evernote addin Works in
Outlook 2013 same with the PayPal app
and both of these addins work without
any code changes both in Outlook 2016
and in
2013 now that we talked about Outlook
adding commands in Outlook 2016 and 2013
let's talk about how you can get these
add-ins users can now install apps right
from inside the Outlook experience we
call this feature the incline store our
primary goal was to give the store a
native Outlook experience and make it
super easy for users to install add-ins
let's do a quick demo you can see this
inclined experience by clicking on the
store button on the Outlook ribbon
notice how some of the add-ins are
already toggled to the on state that's
because these add-ins are already
installed on my mailbox to install an
addin I can simply toggle the aod addin
to the on state notice there is search
functionality here I can search for any
addin in this
experience I can click on it to see more
details for example I can see the
ratings and the reviews and
screenshot when I'm done I can close
this inclined experience and you can see
Outlook has refreshed and install the
evode addin on my
ribbon add-in commands is already
available in Outlook 2016 in January we
will release support for add-in commands
in Outlook 2013 and the incline store
will also be broadly available in
Outlook 2016 our plan does not stop here
our goal is to take add in commands to
overand outlook.com we also plan to
bring the incline store to the other
clients stay tuned for more
updates here are some resources for you
I encourage you to visit Dev out.com you
can find the giup example that I use to
build this Outlook add in command you
should have everything you need to get
started thanks for attending this
session and I hope you found it useful
happy coding folks

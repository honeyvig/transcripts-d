- It's lunchtime, and this is
Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
(bouncy music)
Here in Redmond, we're
visited by some of the
smartest people on the planet.
Pretty much every day.
Every chance I get,
I meet up with them for lunch.
(bouncy music)
Today I'm meeting up
with Microsoft veteran
and industry icon, Kurt DelBene,
Executive Vice President of Strategy
and Operations at Microsoft.
(jazzy piano)
okay, now tell me about
you coming to Microsoft.
- Yeah?
- 1991, 1992.
- Yeah.
- This was early days Microsoft.
I worked for a woman named
Karen Hargrove, at the time,
in this advanced technology group.
And what we were doing at the time
was putting a version of
Windows into fax machines,
copiers, phones, literally had to install.
- (laughing) The original embedded.
- Yeah, the story I remember
most from there was,
you know, I did the analytic things,
what's the market telling us, etc.,
and I presented all of
this to Nathan Myhrvold,
the CTO at the time--
- Oh yeah, I remember Nathan.
- Who was my boss's boss, and I said,
"You know, Nathan, it seems
that people don't want
"a fax machine with a touchscreen on it.
"They just wanna hit 10
digits and hit send."
And his response was, well at Microsoft,
we don't look at market
research, we just know.
- (laughing) Contrast that now--
- Yeah, contrast that deeply now.
We have learned, we have come a long way
since those points, just night and day
in terms of that, you know.
There's not that arrogance of, you know,
we know all the answers, let
us just tell you the answers.
It's about, you know, we think we have,
we believe we know the answers,
let's talk to you and figure out
how the technology works for you,
what can you tell us about
where it doesn't fit.
- So you started in 1991,
you left for a few years
as you went and worked on healthcare.gov,
and you came back.
What's the difference you saw in Microsoft
from when you left till you came back?
- Oh I think it's night and day.
I think one, Satya's driving a culture
where it's about the customer,
it's about learning what we need to learn,
it's about adapting over a period of time.
When he talks about the growth mindset,
he actually, he really means that.
- [Brad] Oh yeah, he embodies it.
- You know, the other thing
is the bets that we made,
we started making ten years ago,
they're really coming into their fold,
so you know, Office 365, we
used to see Google a bunch
in terms of, you know, what
are enterprise customers
considering Google or
not, we don't see that
as much any more because
the value proposition
is so strong with 365--
- It's just the default.
- Yeah, it is.
I hate to ever say it's just the default,
but it is the first,
it's absolutely the thing
that people would think of, and then,
the stitching together of those.
Like what does it mean
if I'm on Office 365
and now I wanna move
my estate to the Cloud?
What, you know, things
like the Office Graph,
working against the LinkedIn Graph,
being able to do ML against in the Cloud,
those scenarios are really popular.
- [Brad] I tell you, we
are so happy you're back.
- Well, thank you, I'm happy to be back.
- All right, it's good to see you, Kurt.
- Thanks, Brad.
- All right, let's make sure
we do this more regularly.
- All right, see you later.
- All right, bye.
- Next time on Brad 
Anderson's Lunch Break--
- Part of what we try to do at Premera,
and how we leverage technology is
to solve those four issues.
- I did a search on LinkedIn
and there were multiple
Mark Gregory's that I found.
- Right.
- So let's play, which one are you.
- Okay. (laughing)
- Back in the early 2000, did you own
a small chain of pizza
restaurants in Alaska?
- [Mark] I did not.
- Did you have a role in the movie
Adam and Eve Meet the Cannibals?
- Oh, man, no.
I wish I did though!
Didn't that sound like
the greatest script?
- No, seriously, right?

- Are you sure about this?
I mean, really sure because this would all
be a bit of a departure for us.
- Yeah, but maybe this season

- So, how simple?
- Maybe, instead of driving
around in flashy cars,
we do something a little more classy,
maybe a place like this.

- I don't know man, we kind of have
a reputation to uphold with
the whole exotic car thing.
- I've loved that we've
had a lot of fun with that,
maybe sometime we just kinda
switch it up a little bit
and do somethin' a little more classy.
- Well, if you want
classy, we can do that.
(classical music)
- Classy, right?
- Yeah, classy.

Redmond may not be the
fanciest place in the world,
but we're lucky enough to be visited by
the very smartest people on
earth pretty much everyday,
and every chance I get, I
meet up with them for lunch.
(upbeat jazz music)
(chatting and laughing)
It's lunch time,
and this is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.

But we could still do
the setup next season
with the piano, right?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

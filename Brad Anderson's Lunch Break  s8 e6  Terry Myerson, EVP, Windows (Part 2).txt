(car zooms)
- It's lunch time and this is
Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
(happy music)
(cars driving)
Here at Redmond, we're visited
by some of the smartest
people on the planet,
pretty much every day.
Every chance I get,
I meet up with them for lunch.
(happy upbeat music)
In this episode I wrap up
my in depth conversation
with Terry Myerson,
Executive Vice President
of the Windows and Devices Group.
We were talking yesterday
and you were describing how
you see the role of the
CIO really change into one
who focuses on the culture
of creativity and teamwork
in an organization.
- Well, certainly the modern workplace
CIO's for sure.
- Yeah
Yeah those who are kinda ahead of the game
and thinking about it, I
think it's gonna be all about
that culture, it's gonna be all about,
You got millennials
entering the work force
with different expectations than you know,
I guess we're not millennials, huh?
(laughs)
- We try to be.
- Yeah so they have
different expectations than
people that've been in the
workforce for 20 years,
different tools but you want
everyone to work together.
To me that's a culture of
question of how you want
your company to work.
- You were one of the pioneers
on taking us to the cloud.
I mean, go back to when
we were working together
when you were running exchange
and I mean I was running systems center,
you know saw this opportunity,
this vision to take change to the cloud,
and that's really kinda the foundation
of what became Office three 65,
what were you seeing
then that led you to say,
hey we need to go deliver
this as a cloud service,
that was very early.
- Oh what happened there
was some amazing customers
began to scale of what they
wanted to do with exchange.
Number of devices they wanted to support,
number of remotes sites
they want to support,
the amount of storage
they wanted to manage
on behalf of those users,
and then compliance came in,
it was complex.
And it got to this place where
there were just repeatable
patterns across customers,
and just got to this place where some,
especially with medium sized businesses,
there was this sort of you know,
customers in this 500 to
a couple thousand seats
that weren't able to hire
big teams with the expertise,
it was like let us do it for you.
We did get started with you know
these few customers and
then it was about learning,
about listening and learning
and then understanding what it would take
so we could offer the same capabilities
to customers all over the world.
- And now you look at that
and that really has been the foundation
that Office three 65 was built on,
which is the most commonly
used cloud service
enterprise period.
- Yeah.
I mean it's amazing. It's,
- And then you did something similar
when you took over Windows,
I can remember hearing
you for the first time
describing delivering
Windows as a service,
you know so what patterns
were you seeing there?
- I think it's the same pattern of,
you're listening to the customer,
and you're looking for where
the challenges were happening,
in terms of serving these customers best,
in the case of Windows we
were on a three yearly cycle,
and we had this disconnect
where customers were asking for,
they wanted to have
more influence over the,
more transparency more
open development model,
but they also just wanted be
able to get bite size value.
And you know that's quite a challenge,
'cause Windows is an enormous codebase.
- Oh my word.
- It's it might be the single
biggest software project
in the world of course
we don't know the size
of every other software project,
but it's certainly the
biggest software project
we have at Microsoft and
that we know of and the,
so thinking about how do we now develop it
more incrementally such that we can still
go after these bold and ambitious goals,
but also deliver it you know,
what's now twice a year,
allows us to have this ability
to listen learn react
to what customers want.
- I think it was you look at it kinda like
the history of the software industry,
I think what you guys pulled
off in a single release,
really is one of the most amazing
things that I've ever seen
done in software.
- I mean that's nice to say
but we built on top of the work
done before us in all cases.
You know if you look
back in Windows history,
Windows seven was a fantastic release
that built on some great
work in Windows Vista
that didn't land very well,
and I think we'll look back on Windows 10
and say it really did build on
some great work in Windows eight.
Which you know we didn't land as well
as we would've liked.
You know these big platform releases
with hundreds and hundreds
of millions of lines of code,
you got backward compatibility,
you've got security you got
everyone from militaries
around the world to consumers
depending on it to work and,
- The thing's that you set that vision up
that gave you the most
trepidation as the leader
in finally changing how Windows
(laughing)
I mean what were the things
that gave you the most concern?
- The biggest challenge
is always the ecosystem.
You know with Windows you're
not building a product,
you're building an ingredient that really
encompasses the work of so many companies.
(lighthearted music)
- Well you know we should make this
like a regular occurrence
(laughter)
- Alright man see you around
- Thanks Terry
- There are a lot of cameras in here
- Alright thanks Terry
- Next time on Brad
Anderson's lunch break,
How much seniority do you need at ABI
in order to ride one of the Clydesdales?
(laughter)
- Let's not talk about technology
- Yeah
- Let's talk about capabilities
and that really helps you
get that seat at the table
and then you can use that to innovate.

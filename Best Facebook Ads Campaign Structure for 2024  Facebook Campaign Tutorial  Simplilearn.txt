let's get started so before we dive into
the best practices for 2024 let's break
down what a Facebook ad structure is and
why it's so important so understanding
the hierarchy and organization of your
campaigns is a foundation for success in
Facebook advertising so number one is
campaign level so this is where you
define your overall marketing objective
whether you are aiming for brand
awareness lead generation or driving
conversions this object will guide you
how your ad is optimized and delivered
to your audience so for example if
you're launching a new product you might
choose a conversions objective to drive
sales directly from your ads moving down
a level we arrive at the ad set so this
is where the magic of targeting happens
within each campaign you can create
multiple adsets to test different
variables here's what you'll configure
at the adset level number one audience
targeting you define who you want to see
your ads this could be based on
demographics like age gender and
location interests such as Fitness or
technology or behaviors like online
shopping habits you can even Target
custom audiences based on your own
custom data or create lookalike
audiences to reach new users similar to
your best customers and then comes
placements decide where your ads will
appear Facebook gives you the option to
choose automatic placements which allow
their AI to design the best placement
across Facebook Instagram messenger and
and Audience Network alternatively you
can manually select placements but be
aware that this might limit your ads
reach and performance and then budget
and schedule ad set level you can set a
daily or lifetime budget deciding how
much you want to so you also determine
the schedule specifying when your ads
should run now this is crucial for
campaigns targeting specific times or
dates such as a holiday scale and
finally we reach the ad itself this is
where the creativity happens the actual
content your audience will engagement at
this level you'll design your ad which
includes selecting your media like
images videos or corses writing
compelling ad copy and choosing a call
to action that aligns with your campaign
objective for example if your goal is
conversions a CTA like shop now or sign
up might be most effective remember the
ad is where you capture the audience
attention so it needs to be visually
appealing and highly relevant to your
target audience so in summary think of
the campaign structure as a strategic
framework the campaign is your
overarching strategy the ad sets are
your technical approaches and the ads
are your execution tools so well
structured campaign ensures that each
element is aligned and optimized to
achieve your marketing goals now that we
have a solid understanding of the basic
structure let's talk about the best
campaign structure for 2024 so as
digital marketing continues to evolve so
to do the strategies that drive the best
results so in 2024 one strategy stands
out campaign budget optimization
so campaign budget optimization or CBO
is a game Cher in Facebook advertising
instead of setting a budget for each
adet individually CBO allows you to
allocate your budget at a campaign level
so Facebook's AI then automatically
distributes this budget across your
adsets based on performance for example
if one adet is driving more conversions
at a lower cost Facebook will allocate
more of your budget to that adet
ensuring that your overall campaign
delivers the best possible results this
means you can trust Facebook's AI to
optimize your budget distribution
without constantly monitoring and
adjusting it yourself another key
component of the best campaign structure
is Consolidated adsets so in the past
marketers often created many narrow
adsets targeting very specific audiences
however this approach can limit the
effectiveness of Facebook's AI so by
consolidating your adsets grouping
similar audiences together you give
Facebook's algorithm more data to work
with leading to better op mization and
improve performance for example instead
of creating separate adsets for
different age groups within the same
interest category you might combine them
into a single adset and let Facebook
optimize delivery based on performance
now the next is ADD creative testing
Facebook allows you to create multiple
ad variations within a single adset so
you can test different images videos
headlines and ctas to see which
resonates most with your audience this
way you are constantly optimizing your
creative ensuring that your ads remain
fresh and engaging so by leveraging CBO
consolidating your adets and
consistently testing your ad creators
you'll be well equipped to navigate the
of Facebook advertising and Achieve
Superior results so let's take
everything we have discussed and put it
into practice I'm going to walk you
through creating a campaign using the
best structure for 2024 step by step so
start by clicking create to set up a new
campaign so the first step in creating
your campaign is choosing the right
objective your objective defines what
you want to achieve with your ads
whether it's building brand awareness
driving traffic to your website or
converting sales so Facebook offers a
range of objectives categorized under
awareness consideration and conversion
so for example if our goal is to
increase sales of a new fitness apparel
you choose the sales
objective so this objective optimizes
your ads to reach people most likely to
make a purchase so after selecting sales
let's press
continue and let's press manual sales
campaign so next we have to name our
campaign something descriptive to help
us track it later so you can also set up
AB testing at this stage to compare
different versions of your ads like for
broader campaigns consider using
campaign budget optimization to let
Facebook automatically distribute your
budget across ad sets to maximize
results so for example let's name our
campaign Fitness apparel sales campaign
and let's enable AB
testing so that it can experiment with
different ad creators this way we can
test with our
audience now if your ads are relating to
housing or employment or credit or
political issues you'll need to select
the appropriate special ad category so
this ensures complience with Facebook's
advertising policies as now since our
campaign doesn't fall under these
categories we can skip this step so once
it's done let's press
next now after campaign comes the adet
so now this is the adet page so start by
naming your adet which could reflect the
specific audience you're targed so if
you're running a conversion focused
campaign you'll need to define the
specific conversion event like a
purchase lead or app install so for
example we will name our adset as
purchase conversion
so now next you have to Define your
target audience so for that just a
second yeah so you can narrow down your
Audience by location as you can see here
you can narrow down your Audience by
location so right now we have kept it
India itself age gender language
interest behaviors and even use custom
audience based on your data or create a
lookalike audience so for a fitness app
campaign we'll Target users age around
18 who are interested in fitness health
and wellness will also include a custom
audience of past purchases and create a
lookalike audience to find new customers
similar to our best ones now let's go to
placements so Facebook offers two
placement options which is automatic
placements where Facebook chooses where
to show your ads for the best results
and then we have manual placements where
you can select specific platforms and
placements so here we have chosen
automatic placement to let Facebook
distribute our ads across its platforms
including Instagram and Audience Network
for maximum reach now we can set our
budget and schedule so you can choose a
daily budget which spreads your spent
evenly each day or a lifetime budget
where Facebook optimizes spend across
campaign duration so here we have set a
daily budget of 800 rupees and schedule
the campaign to run for 2 weeks so here
the start date is 3rd September so we
can give the end date as 17th
September yeah so this will give us data
to analyze performance and make
adjustments if necessary so after doing
all this let's press next so next start
by naming your ad to keep things
organized then choose your ad format so
Facebook offers various formats
including coril single image or video
and collection so each format serves
different goals for example we will name
r add as Fitness
apparel
Fitness appar
here we are choosing an image so image
add so next you have to add your media
so make sure your visuals are high
quality and align with your brand
message so here we have already selected
single image or video you can go down
and add media add
image
selected next so here they will show you
different layouts like for example if
you are showing your add-on feeds this
would be the layout or if you planning
to upload it as stories or reals this
would be lay out Etc so you can select
accordingly and press
next and again you can edit your image
you know you can adds you can expand
image if needed and you can even do text
improvements and once you edit is done
let's go to next now next step is to
write or add copy so you have your
primary text which should be engaging
and informative and then you have the
headline which should be catchy and then
you have your description which must be
consise so don't forget to select a
strong call to action to guide users in
what to do next like for example in this
ad the primary text could be upgrade
your workout with the latest Fitness
apparel so and the headline can be 20%
off just a
second 20%
off and our call to action can be Sho
now that you know you can find so many
call to actions like sign up subscribe
order now so let's just keep it shop now
so finally add your URL and any tracking
parameters so this is crucial for
tracking the effectiveness of your ads
and understanding where your traffic is
coming from now the next step is
publishing so before you publish take a
moment to review all your settings from
the campaign objective to the ad
creative double check your audience
targeting budget and schedule to ensure
everything is set correctly so once you
publish your campaign will be live but
the work doesn't stop there you have to
regularly monitor your campaign's
performance in the ads manager key
metrics like CTR CPC and conversions
will help you understand what's working
and where adjustments are needed also
use AB testing to compare different ad
creatives audience segments and
placements So based on the results you
can optimize your campaign for better
performance so by continuously refining
your campaign you'll maximize your
return on investment and achieve your
marketing goals in 2024 so that's what

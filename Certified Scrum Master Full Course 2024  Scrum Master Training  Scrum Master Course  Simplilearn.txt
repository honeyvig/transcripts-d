scrum scrum is an agile framework that
has revolutionized the way complex
projects are managed and completed its
adaptability focus on collaboration and
iterative approach makes it an ideal
methodology for dynamic and fast-paced
environments while scrum is most
commonly associated with software
development its principles and practices
can be applied to various Industries to
enhance efficiency and product quality
this comprehensive tutorial aims to
provide you with a deeper understanding
of scrum covering its roles artifacts
event processes benefits and practical
implementation by the end of this
tutorial you will have a solid graphs of
scr and how to leverage its potential
for your projects now let us move on to
the second part with a thorough
discussion on what is Scrum roles the
product owner plays a very crucial role
in scrum acting as a voice of the
customer so this is a first scrum role
that we see in scrum methodology that is
a product owner this individual is
basically responsible for defining and
prioritizing the product backlog
ensuring that the team focuses on the
most valuable task the product owner
Works closely with stakeholders to GA
requirements set clear goals and make
informed decisions about the product
Direction the key responsibilities of
the product owner includes defining the
product vision and road map creating and
managing the product backlog
prioritizing backlog items based on
value risk and urgency ensuring that a
team understands the backlog items and
their importance and also accepting or
rejecting completed work based on pred
criteria next role we have is Scrum
Master the scrum Master is a facilitator
and Coach who ensures that scrum
framework is followed effectively this
role involves removing obstacles that
hinder the team's progress promoting a
culture of continuous Improvement and
fostering collaboration the scrum master
act as a servant leader supporting a
team in achieving their goals without
dictating how they should work the key
responsibilities of the scrum Master
includes facilitating scrum events like
Sprint planning daily scrum Sprint
review and Sprint retrospective then
comes removing impediments that block
the team's progress moving ahead we have
also coaching the team on scrum
practices and principle then we have a
tough discussion on protecting the team
from external distractions and
interruptions and finally promoting a
healthy team Dynamic and addressing
conflicts next one we have is the
development team so guys the development
team team consists of professionals who
work collabora to deliver a product
increment this self-organizing team is
cross functional meaning it possesses
all the skills necessary to complete the
work without relying on external sources
the development team is accountable for
creating high quality increments that
meet the definition of done the key
responsibilities of development team
includes estimating planning work during
Sprint planning collaborating daily to
achieve this spr goal delivering a
potentially shippable product increment
by the end of the Sprint then
continuously improving their processes
and practices and finally maintaining
transparency through regular
Communications and updates now let us
move on and understand about scrum
artifacts the first one that we have all
over here is product backlog the product
backlog is a dynamic list of all the
works needed for the product it includes
features enhancements bug fixes and
Technical t ask the product owner is
basically responsible for maintaining
and prioritizing the backlog ensuring
that it reflects the current needs and
goals of the project the product backlog
is continuously refined with items being
added removed or reprioritized as
necessary the product backlog serves as
a single source of Truth for the team
providing a clear road map of what needs
to be done it is essential that backlog
items are well defined with clear
acceptance criteria to guide the
development team and delivering the
expected value then we have the Sprint
backlog the Sprint backlog is a subset
of the product backlog containing items
selected for the current Sprint during
Sprint planning the team decides which
backlog items they can commit to
completing within the Sprint the Sprint
backlog also includes a plan for how the
team will accomplish such work Sprint
backlog provides a focused and
actionable plan for the team outlining
the tasks and goals for the Sprint it is
a living document continuously updated
as the team progresses and learns about
the work the Sprint backlog helps the
team stay organized and aligned with the
Sprint goal then we have is increment
increment is a sum of all the work at
the end of the Sprint it represents a
potentially shippable product that meets
the definition of done a set of criteria
ensuring that work is complete and of
high quality the increment includes not
only the new features added during the
Sprint but also any improvements or
fixes made to the existing features the
increment provides tangible evidence of
progress allowing stakeholders to
inspect and evaluate the product it
serves as the basis for feedback and
decision making enabling the team to
adapt and refine their approach in
subsequent Sprints then we have is
Sprint now let us move on and discuss
about some of the scrum events the first
one that we have all over here is Sprint
a Sprint is a time box period typically
lasting 24 weeks during which the team
Works to create a product increment the
fixed duration of the Sprint provides a
regular rhythm for the team promoting
consistent delivery and continuous
Improvement each Sprint begins with a
Sprint planning and ends with a Sprint
review and Sprint
retrospective next one we have is Sprint
planning it is a event where the team
defines what will be accomplished in the
upcoming Sprint the product owner
presents the high priority backlog items
and the team collaborates to select
those they can complete within the
Sprint together they set a clear Sprint
goal and create a plan for achieving it
during Sprint planning the team breaks
down the selected backlog items into
smaller tasks and estimates the effort
required this detail planning ensures
that everyone understands the work and
how it contributes to the Sprint goal a
Sprint planning sets the stage for a
focus and productive Sprint next one we
have is the daily scrum daily scrum is a
short time box meeting usually lasting
for 15 minutes held every day during the
Sprint the purpose of the daily scrum is
to synchronize the team activities
discuss progress and identify any
obstacles each team member shares what
they did the previous day what they plan
to do today and any issues they are
facing the daily scrum promotes
transparency and accountability ensuring
that everyone is aligned and aware of
the team status it also provides an
opportunity to to quickly address and
resolve impediments keeping the team on
track to achieve the Sprint goal next we
have all over here is called Sprint
review so guys Sprint review is held at
the end of the Sprint to inspect the
completed work and get the feedback from
stakeholders the team demonstrates the
product increment highlighting what was
accomplished during the Sprint
stakeholders provide input and the
product owner updates the product
backlog based on the feedback the Sprint
review Fosters collaboration and
transparency allowing stakeholders to
see the product's progress and influence
its direction it also provides an
opportunity to celebrate success and
identify areas for improvement and
finally we have the Sprint retrospective
the Sprint retrospective is the final
event of the Sprint where the team
reflects on their processes and
practices the goal is to identify what
went well what could be improved and how
to enhance their performance in future
Sprints the team discusses these
insights creates action items to address
any issues the Sprint retrospectives
promotes a culture for continuous
Improvement encouraging the team to
learn from their experiences and make
incremental changes by regularly
reflecting and adapting the team can
optimize their processes and Achieve
better outcomes now let us understand
the scrum process flow the scrum process
revolves around the Sprint cycle
beginning with the Sprint planning and
ending with the Sprint
retrospective this cycle ensures a
regular cyance of work and Contin
delivery of value if we talk about the
first one we have the Sprint planning
here here the team selects the item for
the product backlog and defines the
Sprint goal they break down the work
into smaller task and create the plan
for the Sprint now guys let us discuss
about the scrum process flow the first
one that we have all over here that is
called as Sprint planning here the team
selects the items from the product
backlog defines the Sprint goal to break
down the work into smaller tab and
create a plan for the Sprint next one we
have the daily scrum daily scrum here
the team meets daily to discuss progress
plans and challenges this meeting keeps
everyone aligned and allows for quick
adjustments third is Sprint review at
the end of the Sprint the team
demonstrates the completed work to the
stakeholders and gathers feedback the
product owner updates the product
backlog based on their feedback and
fourth one we have all over here is
print retrospective here the team
reflects on their processes and
practices identifying areas for
improvement they create action items to
enhance their performance in future
spreads I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding scrum process flow
now let us move on to understanding the
benefits of scrum so guys scrum offers
several significant benefits that can
transform how teams work and deliver
value here are some of the key
advantages the first one that we have
all over here is increased transparency
scrum promotes transparency through its
regular events and clear artifacts a
daily scrum Sprint review retrospective
ensures that everyone is aware of the
team's progress challenges and successes
this transparency helps build trust
among the team member and stakeholders
fostering a collaborative and open
working environment next one we have all
over here is improved team collaboration
the collaborative nature of the scrum
encourages team members to work closely
together leveraging their diverse SK
skills and expertise the scrum Master
facilitates this collaboration helping
the team communicate effectively and
resolve
conflicts this team work leads to better
problem solving Innovation and overall
productivity next one we have enhanced
ability to adapt to changes scrums
iterative approach allows teams to
quickly adapt to changes in requirements
market conditions or customer feedback
by delivering small functional
increments regularly the team can get
the feedback and make necessary
adjustments this flexibility ensures
that product remains aligned with the
stakeholders needs and
expectations and finally it provides
faster delivery of valuable products
increments scrums time box Sprints Drive
the regular delivery of product
increments enabling faster time to
Market this rapid delivery cycle allows
stakeholders to see tangible progress
and realize value sooner it also reduces
the risk of project delays and enhances
the team ability to meet deadlines
now let us discuss some of the common
challenges of following scrum
methodology we all know that scrum
offers many benefits but it also comes
on with its own set of challenges here
are some of the common issues teams May
face the first one that we have all over
here is resistance to change introducing
scrum can be met with resistance
especially in organization accustomed to
traditional project management methods
to overcome this resistance it's
important to provide Education and
Training on scrum principles and
practices involving team members and
stakeholders in transition progress and
highlighting the benefits of the scum
can also help build support next we have
handling distributed teams distributed
teams can face communication and
collaboration challenges to address
these issues it's crucial to leverage
technology tools such as video
conferencing instant messaging and
collaborative software establishing
clear communication protocols and
regular V ual meetings can also help
maintain alignment and cohesion among
team members then we have managing large
projects with scrum a scaling scrum for
large projects can be complex one
approach is to adopt Frameworks like
scrums of scrums Nexus or safe which is
scaled agile framework it provides
guidelines for coordinating multiple
scrum teams ensuring that teams are
cross functional and self-organizing
with clear communication channels which
are very very essential for managing
large projects
effectively now let us dive into most
interesting part that is what are the
tools and softwares which are used for
scrum so guys several tools and
softwares can support scrum practices
enhancing productivity and collaboration
here are some of the most popular
options the first one I would recommend
is jira jira is widely used project
management tool that offers robust
support for scrub it provides features
for creating and managing product back
logs Sprint backlogs and tracking
progress through Visual boards jira's
customizable workflows and Reporting
capabilities make it a powerful tool for
scrum team next one we have all over
here is Trello Trello is a flexible
userfriendly tool that uses boards lists
and cards to organize tasks it's well
suited for scrum teams allowing them to
create and manage backlogs plan Sprints
and track progress Trello Simplicity and
visual nature make it easy to use
especially for smaller teams or project
and finally we have Azure devops Azure
devop is a comprehensive suit of
development tools that supports scrum
and other agile methodologies it
includes features or backlog management
Sprint planning continuous integration
and deployment aure devops integrates
seamlessly with other Microsoft tools
making it a good choice for teams using
Microsoft ecosystem so guys in this

organization seeking skilled scrum
Masters and agile Leaders with the right
preparation and dedication you can
unlock new carrier opportunities and
drive successful project delivery using
agile and scrum methodologies then
there's something called scrum board
which is used during this flow of scrum
right from product backlog to the
creation of that increment so let us
look at what is a scrum board which is
used during the scrum practice so scrum
board is a physical or virtual tool that
helps team to visualize items in the
Sprint back clock so it helps in
tracking what is being delivered what is
in progress and what needs to be
delivered further so it shows shows all
action items during the daily scrum
helping keeping the team focused on
tasks that need to be completion and the
priorities of those the scrum board is
usually present in a place that's
accessible to all team members it is a
visual board right and can be physical
whiteboard and stickers or virtual
software tools which can be used and
displayed on the screen so the scrum
board is divided into different slots
like too in progress and done so when
new prints are started the existing
board is reset and new scrum board is
created so since it is visual system I
think it is taking the thought from kban
so visual system always works effective
because the moment I know I see
something is uh put against my name that
I need to complete this it's quite
obvious to me that I will put efforts to
complete it so it's a conscious effort
what I will put it works on my
Consciousness so something which is not
visible to me it is that out of sight is
out of mind so I will not work on it so
I may there is a tendency to
forget first slide here has to do with
user stories and epics and what I want
to do team is I want to before we get
into the user stories I want to go to
the Whiteboard and I want to just give
you a little bit more
information that might help us in
organizing our discussion that we're
about to embark on
here so a word that is not in our slides
is themes themes are
epics and user stories grouped together
you know similar epics and user stories
group together for planning purposes so
an epic is Big um you would never do an
epic in or pardon me a theme in a Sprint
it's too big
um so it's used for planning
purposes below that I would put epics
epics are low
priority large user
stories meaning that an ethic will
eventually have to be disaggregated into
multiple user
Stories the reason it would be low
priority is because if it if an epic was
higher up on the product back log um it
would have to be more detailed that's
when you would break it down so epics
are usually going to live at the lower
uh priority levels of a product backlog
and as user stories are completed and
the Epic rises in priority it will
eventually be broken down into um more
manageable user stories so great big low
priority user stories then we have user
stories
themselves user stor
are
functions or
features that the product owner wants to
have developed a user story turns into
working
software that provides value to the
customer and um and the product owner is
the customer voice the product owner is
the one who would accept to reject
completed user
stories and then there are t ask S and a
reminder when we were talking about the
Sprint planning meeting we said the
Sprint planning meeting is uh got two
parts to it the first part is selecting
all of the user stories that are going
to be included in the Sprint and then
disaggregating each of those user
stories into
tasks that's done in the Sprint planning
meeting and then those tasks are the
things that are actually then done when
the uh work of the Sprint
begins user stories can be estimated in
story
points or ideal days most teams favor
story points they might start with ideal
days but they will then usually end up
going to story points um tasks are uh
estimated in I ideal
time which is usually hours okay so now
back to our
slides so at the top left a use case
could be an example of a user story so
it's something that um the user wants to
do and how the system should support it
um like um a use case could
be um select and pay for items in a
catalog now that could actually be an
epic or maybe a theme because maybe it
would get disaggregated into log on
screen uh catalog uh shopping cart and
checkout but the so the use case could
either be a standalone user story or it
could actually be uh a number of user
stories um that would result from it
below that requirement it could be a
functional requirement a technical task
or even a bug fix so I'm going to go
back to the Whiteboard and
a product
backlog is going to have a lot of user
stories that come from the
customer right whatever the customer
wants
then but the team may know that it has
to do some development work in order for
the user stories to even be able to work
you know there's some system level
non-functional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be Tech user
stories and then can you see the this
low I can't see your chats but then
there could also be defect user stories
there could even be RIS user stories now
what could happen is that um the product
owner ranks these in priority so this
one first then that one then that one
and the team says well the only thing is
is that um we have to do some
development work before we can actually
do user story to and so what we really
need to do is insert that before the uh
the second priority user story and so
the priority of the user stories in the
product backlog while it might start
with just being you know simple
functional user stories coming from the
uh product owner it will evolve until it
includes some other things that are also
considerations when it comes to uh
priorities because of you know successor
predecessor relationships dependencies
and things like that are um
considerations a user story be uh back
to the the uh screen um bottom left now
the user story um can use a fictitious
user or a Persona to help uh the team or
the the team and the product owner to
get an idea of okay who's going to be
doing this function uh what are they
going to need in order to be able to
complete the function Etc so you try and
um come up with an actual well a
fictitious but a person who's actually
doing it to kind of get out of the realm
of you know listing requirements and you
know specs and things like that and say
okay what's the user experience need to
look like top right template a portion
of a user story is um let me back up so
a user story card um is usually going to
contain um a brief description of the
user story using some kind of a metal
language format like we're suggesting
right here as a user or Persona I want
this feature so that I can so not unlike
our um estimating session here as a
frequent traveler I want to eat grapes
so I can be healthier in the one that we
uh didn't do uh the inventory system as
a customer okay there's a a user I want
to get cash back so I don't have to wait
in line at the bank okay here's another
user story as a consumer I want the
shopping cart functionality to easily
purchase items online and maybe that
could be customer as well um as an
executive right as a suit I want to
generate a sales report so I know which
departments need to improve their
productivity as a buyer so you can see I
tried to come up with these different
roles right here executive buyer sales
rep Etc
um and that's the format as a type of
user I want some kind of goal um or
feature and uh so that's some kind of a
reason um the below that connect connect
the dots by writing all of the user
stories necessary to
uncover the entire use case so like we
were talking about right here if you
want to be able to purchase items online
from a catalog that might be uh multiple
user stories in order to support that
use case and so of course um we would
want to be able to connect the dots and
see where all the user stories fit in
into the overall goal of the project or
release and the stories
um excuse
me um are grouped to form an epic or
higher level story so epic or theme um
stories can then be split into child
stories or task and so that's what we
were covering before right so you have
uh
themes up at the top that's the biggest
grouping if you will used primarily
for um you know high level planning
purposes so you have your themes then
you have your epics which are large user
stories um low priority and they're
going to have to be broken down into
smaller user stories like in the
question that we had at the end of the
the last section where um the product
owner needed something done and the team
said well based on the size of this user
story it's going to take three Sprints
to do well a user story has to be small
enough to be completed within a single
Sprint so a Sprint can contain more than
one user story but a user story cannot
span Sprints so that feature or function
that was in the question was probably
more like an epic it was something that
would need to be uh disaggregated into
smaller user stories or perhaps it was
more of a use case that would need more
than one user story in order to actually
deliver the overall use
case let's see as a product supervisor I
want to see an unfinished part
list at the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day great user
story description well done
verage um did you hear that team as a
product super supervisor I want to see
an unfinished part list at the end of
the day so I can reallocate work the
next day that is a well-crafted
description of a user
story
now here are some things that I want you
to memorize you were hoping I was done
with the memorization part so I want you
to
um remember that we have to invest in
our user stories
and I was going over to the Whiteboard
and I didn't change cameras so let me do
that I recommend um you know figuring
out how you memorize best so that you
can if um well not if you wanted to what
I recommend is being able to write out
all of this stuff on plain white scrap
paper in about 14 minutes because that's
the amount of free time you have in the
tutorial when you're at the the uh or
when you're taking the test um exen does
a little bit different you maybe won't
have a tutorial the only time you'd have
a tutorial as if you were at a center
taking a test um exen has other options
like you can do a paper based test um uh
where you get a third party you know a
buddy or somebody who will agree to sort
of Proctor the test for you or you can
do it on your laptop all by yourself and
they have software that watches you
while you're taking the test and they
require you to take the laptop and do
like a 360 so that um they can verify
that you don't have any cheat sheets up
on the wall or anything like that but
the point is is um you got to have this
memorized um whether you're going to
dump it out on the paper or not um when
I took the test um I actually did the
paper based option um and that was
because of some kind time constraints
and it was the quickest way to get me
into the test and so I didn't write out
any of the stuff I'd memorized but I had
it memorized and I had it memorized well
enough that I could kind of recall it in
my mind's eye okay so we're talking
about user stories and you have to
invest in your user stories you know I
like memorizing things by creating these
charts that have the first
letter of the word or phrase that you're
memorizing in a separate column
and then I make up a story you know that
uh reminds me that I've got to have in V
this one is pretty easy probably just
invest Works um but so let's go over
that I stands for
independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own um you don't have when
we're doing scrum you don't do a US user
story that won't result in working
software we just talked about the
description of user stories right so
it's a user that needs some kind of
functionality for some kind of a reason
and they're all independent will they
work together of course they'll work
together if that's a necessity but um if
you developed a log on screen you could
demonstrate working software for the
login screen there might be another user
story that is um you know has to do with
displaying uh the catalog and being able
to flag or select items that you want to
purchase but there'd be working software
for that would they work together yes
but each user story would
complete um or result in some kind of
working software and they have to be
independent
negotiable negotiable in the way the
user story is going to be
implemented the product owner doesn't
dict to the team the team doesn't say it
it's only this way and we don't want to
hear anything from you so there are
discussions about the size and
implementation for each user user story
so the product owner can't make it so
detailed that there's no room for
discussion and the possibility of you
know the team coming up with Solutions
other than what the product owner was
attempting to
dictate um v stands for valuable
meaning each user story has to create
value for the customer or the end
user e it has to be
estimable as an estimat except estimat
is not really a word it's
estimable um and ass as for small has to
be small enough to be done in a single
Sprint if we're doing two we Sprints has
to be able to be done in two weeks or
less if we're doing four- we Sprints it
could deal l user story but it would
still uh have to be done in four weeks
or less and then the last one the t is
testable every user story needs to be
testable and it needs to be testable at
two levels remember our triangle needs
to be testable at the intrinsic quality
level unit tests Etc and also testable
at the extrinsic level which is the
customer point of view which is
acceptance so every user story uh has to
be
testable okay so that's invest and so
let's add that to our list of things to
memorize
invest and then the next one we have
here is um the three C's of a user
story so the first C team is
card so user stories should be able to
be written on a 4X 6in index card or
some uh media similar to
that
card the the second C is
conversation the user story card is the
item that is used for the team and the
product owner to talk and discuss in
order to make sure that the product
owner and the team are on the same page
when it comes to what is actually
supposed to be developed and um uh what
you know so what it's supposed to look
like at the end which leads us to the
third one which is
confirmation each user story essentially
has to have acceptance tests um in it
itself so card 4x6 conversation that's
the starting point that's where uh the
team and the product owner discuss and
then eventually there will be acceptance
tests included on the user story card um
in order to be used during the Sprint
review to um assure that it's acceptable
that there's
confirmation okay so oh let's add that
to the memorization
list so
three
C's all right now I've got an example
here of a user story
card so we're looking right
here and if you were to go out on the
internet and search um user story cards
um they would be similar there would be
some differences of course
um but typically what you're going to
have is you're going to have a title or
a name for the user story and then
there's going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 321 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about as a librarian I want
to have the facility of searching a book
by different criteria so that I will
save time while serving a
customer then there might be some other
descriptive words or links to other
information that might be necessary and
then there would be acceptance criteria
or tests sometimes these get included on
the back of the card but the point is is
that they are on the cord on the card
rather then there will be an estimate of
size it could be ideal days or story
points as I mentioned most teams do
story points that's more likely what
you'll be tested on as opposed to um
ideal days but you know we'll cover
cover both so you
understand uh the
differences um there is probably it's
not listed here but there's probably
going to be a
um value point assignment this is where
the product owner um kind of determines
in a relative way the uh value of the
stories just like we were doing in
planning poker the product owner might
say well this story is twice as value
valuables as uh this other one comparing
them together and this is what um these
value points are what's used to uh
prioritize the user stories that's
supposed to be a v as in value points
and then typically there's also going to
be a indication sometimes it's just by
colors um it could be words uh that has
to do with um you know where the story
came from did it come from the customer
that would be considered a functional
requirement um if it came from the team
that would be from the technical domain
I'm trying to write where
from uh you know it's not me team it's
the
mouse
clearly it's hard to uh do that that's
from where from um here it's got uh
customer tech you could also have defect
you could maybe have risk um and then
there's also going to be an X
Factor um which would
be some kind of word probably like
um stable um
erratic um
incomplete something like that to uh so
the team is designating the user story
in uh respect to the amount of
uncertainty or risk that's associated
with that user story and because all of
that's a part of the story right the
story is going to be turned into working
software there may need to be uh some
efforts to actually figure out how to
actually do that user
story so that's the X Factor um over to
the right here on the same chart we have
some comments
about um if you are using a software
package
excuse me like Trello or jira or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that um
could even include things like
responsible team member or depending on
how you're doing it you would break the
user Story down into tasks and you might
have team members assigned to various
tasks for the user story
um okay so that's typically what a user
story card is like sometimes their cards
sometimes they're like on sticky notes
and they're put up on a can band board
if you're using can band to track the
project if you have a story that is too
large to be completed in a Sprint it's
going to have to be subdivided or we
call it disaggregation into um smaller
user stor
and there's uh three ways that we're
proposing here that you could go about
doing that you could split it based on
operational boundaries for example as an
operator one needs to manage
reservations which could be split for
example there could be one portion that
is uh that has to do with making a
reservation another one that has to do
with modifying it and yet another one
that has to do with cancelling it so um
that could be split into in this
construct here three separate user
stories you could also separate based on
exceptions or crosscutting concerns for
example in the beginning develop only
one main path like accept repayment for
a
loan then address exceptions like what
if a person um
overpays then um come up with a user
story that recognizes that and processes
a refund and or gives the option of
allocating the overpayment to a future
payment or something like that and then
also um um adds on other concerns like
the tech access restrictions or record
name of operator so maybe um you know
when you're working on uh accepting
payments or processing refunds it's
going to check on um who the operator is
or track that so that if at a later time
you know who was it that gave this uh
refund here well you could look and see
you know okay the the operator's name
was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
um is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different
privileges okay and then down at the
bottom split Based on data boundaries
for an example you know as an accountant
one needs to enter balance sheet
information
um which could then be split
into summary
information and separately um uh
receivable details or you know maybe you
could have AP you know so you could have
different portions of the
overall
um balance sheet um activities that need
to be done so enter AR enter
AP
Etc make sense so just to kind of uh
prompt you give you some ideas about
what to do um in a scrum project if you
have the scenario arise where a user
story is being estimated by the team and
it won't fit into a Sprint it's too
big now when it comes to determining
value for user stories this is primarily
owned by the uh product owner right and
it always comes back to money but money
you know the value can be looked at from
different points of view so new Revenue
obviously you know getting new customers
and having them buy
stuff um well below that there's another
consideration incremental Revenue uh so
somebody's in the process of placing an
order um maybe there are some premium
features that could be add-ons at that
point in time um or maybe added later on
so you have an existing cut customer who
actually
buys um more of or enhanced parts of the
existing thing they already purchased or
are in the process of purchasing
retained value so this is
um you know retaining customers so that
they don't go to a
competitor and then the bottom one is
operational efficiency you know how
could things be done to speed up the
process of whatever it is um so that the
cost of delivering uh the product is
reduced so this then leads us to a
discussion about priorities recognizing
that there are some priority concerns
that come from both the customer domain
as well as the technical
domain and there are some priorities
ization models um if we look right here
there is value based
prioritization and the hierarchy of that
would be high value followed by high
risk followed by high value and then low
risk followed by low value and then low
risk so you know we might have written
this a little bit differently but that's
value based prioritization and this is
primarily the product owner with maybe
some input from the team just simply
deciding um what he or she wants done
most listening to the team say well you
know there's some you know greater risks
with this user story than that and so
you'd probably want to uh persuade the
product owner to take care of high-risk
stuff first um because that would have
an a uh oh excuse me sorry an impact on
the future things that need to be done
there's the K the Cano model uh which
looks at each of the user stories and
classifies them as being mandatory
linear or
exciters and the mandatory items are
those user stories that are musts and
they'll never move Beyond move the
customer or the end user Beyond neutral
it's if they're not there it creates
dissatisfaction if the the you the
product owner and the team has done a
good job in identifying what are the
mandatory or threshold items um you
would see that
um um it just gets it to neutral that's
what's expected for the product linear
items um user stories are those user
stories that as they are implemented
progressively throughout the project and
added to the feature set it will linear
increase customer s satisfaction and it
can be you know in their absence
dissatisfaction all the way up to high
implementation creating a great deal of
satisfaction for the customer and then
the third category is exciters and
delighters um and those are features or
functions those are user stories that
are not mandatory and the absence of
them will never result in satisfaction
going below neutral but by adding them
um you could create create excitement
and Delight for the customer these would
typically be things that
are features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or maybe
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or
whatever so that's the Cano model and
then there's weager relative waiting
method and um this is all used numbers
so each feature is given a value for its
benefit and it's penalty given a value
for penalty meaning what's the pain if
that feature or function is not
included and then there is um um the
cost side and the risk
side and then those are all calculated
together and that results in
excuse me a ranking or a hierarchy which
gives you the uh priority for the uh
user
stories um we also talked about Moscow
didn't we did we talk about Moscow uh
Moscow is another prioritization model
must
could I said that differently must
should could won't Moscow mscw must
should could
won't and we talked about that one thank
you for that
confirmation does it seem like a long
time ago or is it just me I know it was
just last weekend but it's like last
year okay so now let's talk about
velocity um uh Priyanka that is exactly
right
um so velocity is the capacity of the
team to
complete work in a single
iteration so the team has estimated the
user stories uh for size or ideal days
and um the Sprints are going to be three
week weeks in duration obviously not all
user stories can be completed in a
single Sprint and be done with the
project well I guess maybe I shouldn't
say Obviously well I'm saying that I'm
thinking well maybe you had a very small
short duration Pro so you could but the
point is is that uh it's the team's
capacity to um complete work in a given
Sprint and it
is an observation it's not a prediction
so if we're working on Sprint
five and we're working on determining
what our velocity
is then um it would be the average of
the previous is four
Sprints if there were any uh outliers
you you would disregard
those
um and so it's an
observation if we look over to question
or uh box number two here velocity is
used to deal with um determining how
many user stories we are going to
include in a given Sprint and also so
how many Sprints are we going to need to
create a release or a set of user
stories and here's an
example in box number three a team
completed five user stories that were
sized 5 3 8 13 and
two two user stories each sized five
were left half complete what is the
velocity of the
team and the answer is either going to
be 31 or
36 31 is the sum of the completed user
stories um if you were 36 you were
claiming half of the two that were five
uh so that would be a total of 10 so you
claim half of it which be five would
take you to
36 but it's not going to be 36 because
the only thing thing that counts
towards progress is working software so
even if the team had finished nine out
of 10 story points for a user story
meaning it's almost done and then the
Sprint ends that doesn't get counted
towards
velocity and you don't mess around with
velocity um you can mess around with
your
estimating and you can mess around with
uh you know what user stories are going
to be completed in a Sprint but you
don't the the velocity is not variable
it is what it is based on past
performance when it comes to levels of
planning we have What's called the
planning onion and let me walk you
through this here up at the the broadest
area is the vision level so the vision
level that's the suits right they're the
ones that have the strategy and
objectives for the company and where
it's going and so they have that overall
big vision for the uh
company which is likely going to include
products and each product should have a
road map my example of that website that
I'm uh working on has uh three versions
um which make up the product road map
version one is the free site version two
is the membership site and and version
three is the um uh the pay referral
commissions uh uh version of the site
and the product road map is then
supported by
releases so for my project I have three
releases so all of the user stories
needed for the free version are in
release one all of the additional user
stories that are needed for the um
uh paid version the subscriber
version uh and then also for version
three those are all releases three
releases and then for each Sprint we
will be pulling user stories from the
release that we're working on a release
is likely going to take multiple Sprints
and um and then the Sprints are
populated by the individual user stories
which are then disaggregated into tasks
and we do the excuse me the daily
scrum which is the daily level of
planning and coordination so we call
that the planning
onion we already kind of talked about
the release and road map um concept here
so let's just review this quickly um
priories high level ethics and determine
goals and releases so we'll use epics
and themes in order to group things
together you know what should be
included in what release so what are the
goals for the releases then the first
bullet point establish goals of release
based on market demand regulatory needs
or customer
expectations for each release you want
to estimate the target
stories repeat until the target stories
are assigned and iteration
length I should that's it's blending
some things here um be able to estimate
velocity and then uh assign stories to
the Sprints so we keep estimating the
user stories and we keep organizing uh
that until we can do that we can come up
with an iteration length or Sprint
length and then figure out what our
velocity for each Sprint is and then uh
assign stories to the uh the Sprints uh
the the next bullet down iterate until
the user stories and release date meets
conditions of satisfaction so that's a
definition of done or acceptance the
release and try not to pack too much
into a release backlog
so
um just like you would not want to pack
too many user stories into a Sprint you
want to have the timelines appropriate
and uh what are included in the uh
events uh make
sense okay so here's a bit more about
release planning on this slide here
um you've got the product backlog here
on the left and then we might come up
with a release plan which could be
flipped and could be looked at uh
horizontally and you probably
plan um
about three releases in
advance um or at least you're doing more
of the detailed planning on that uh
because things are going to emerge when
we do you know Sprint one that's going
to help in Sprint two and things that
happen in Sprints one and two that are
going to help um release three and then
you've got um you know your subsequent
releases where we're just doing very
high level planning it's called rolling
wave planning where we do detailed
planning for things in the future in
tandem with doing high level planning
for things in uh the future did I say
that right detail planning for things in
the near term in tandem with high level
planning for things in the
future um and talked about deciding as
late as possible I believe meaning that
it's better to actually plan the later
uh
releases uh for purposes
of uh making sure we have more
information uh the most information
available okay so
estimation let's start at the top left
the principles behind estimation
understand the cone of uncertainty
which is an estimate or best guess to
begin with and then progressively
becomes more accurate in fact let's just
take a break and look at the cone of
uncertainty so at the very beginning of
a project there's going to be a high
level of
uncertainty um if I were to draw this
chart I would make it a little bit more
like
this so clearly you're going to drisk
the
project as early as you can and then
eventually all risk disappears when the
project is done risk is
uncertainty okay below that the only
estimate that matters is the one given
by the
teun supported by this uh comment here
nothing is impossible for the one who
doesn't have to do it so the product
owner is like team come on you can do
this the team's like no we know what our
velocity is no the product owner says
I'm telling you there's no way that that
can't be done I know you can do it I
trust you I believe in
you but the product owner doesn't have
to do have to do the work okay top right
overestimation and underestimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with it's more likely that we will
underestimate than overestimate
esates and by looking at our
velocity from iteration or Sprint to
Sprint um there could be some
information that is um showing us that
we're underestimating for example
meaning um we're thinking we you know
the user stories are smaller than they
are and that we can get you know a
certain number done in the Sprint and
then there's a fail well that would mean
then that would be discussed during the
retrospective and then we would do
something different going forward which
might include doing some reestimating
scrum estimating is not necessarily more
difficult however scrum exposes bad
estimates sooner which is a good thing
when we were doing our um uh planning
poker you could see that um the first
time as a team you know we didn't know
each other we didn't know everybody's
thoughts and concerns and those kinds of
things you know get shared and absorbed
as a project goes on and so there's a
higher awareness of that so um what we
would say is that um using estimation
techniques scrum estimation techniques
might be um more inaccurate at the
beginning of a project but they will
quickly become very accurate as the um
project advances forward
let's see is there a question here can
velocity be increased over a period of
time for the project yes it can now it's
not that it can it will increase if the
team is learning how to work together
better and better you would expect that
if I can just use my mouse here if we
were
tracking velocity so this would be um
points
completed over here uh let me just do
pts for points and down here is
time and we go from Sprint to Sprint
right you would expect that maybe you
know the first couple of Sprints the
team would be learning how to work
together and there would be a steep
curve and then it would kind of flatten
out and maybe have you know a slow rise
going forward the team emerges as a high
performing team they get better at their
cross uh functional Behavior you know
somebody's the team just keeps
chugging along um other things you know
just um oh
sorry there I bumped the thing on my
screen there
um um so the team you know learns how to
work better together and you know their
estimates become more accurate at Etc
and you would expect a high per a high
performing team to have a uh a result
like this for velocity where there's
quick Improvement and then it kind of
stabilizes and then begins to tick
upwards okay we talked about the cone of
uncertainty let's talk about ideal time
um when we do estimating for user
stories um we do it in I days when we do
estimating for tasks we do it in ideal
time which means hours I think that's on
the Whiteboard or it was on the
Whiteboard oh it was on it um so ideal
time is the amount of time it takes to
complete a piece of
work but that's based
on the Notions
that the team member or members are
available to do just the work with no
distractions or anything at all so
assuming that um prian could sit down
add a keyboard and code for eight hours
without taking a break for lunch no
phone calls no discussions no meetings
of any kind just work eight hours how
much could be done in that 8 hours by
Priyanka that's what ideal time is but
the thing of it is is that there is no
such thing as somebody being able to
spend every minute of every day only
doing work there will be um
distractions so it has to be converted
into a lapse time now we don't convert
it to a lapse time at the user story
level but we do convert it to a lapse
time when we are dealing at the task
level and what that looks like is you
know for each team member you're going
to have to do it separately because some
team members have more distractions than
others some might have other duties that
pull them away um whatever the case may
be um you determine how much time in a
given day a team member is available to
do work so say it's five hours out of
eight for one maybe if it's six hours
out of eight for another maybe it's four
out of eight but you figure out what it
is and then you take the average and
that average availability is used then
to convert Ideal Time into elapse
time um I should have circled this box
here because we talked about this as
well um and then I already mentioned
this here only considers actual work
time not the distractions so that's the
concept of Ideal Time
when it comes to story points it's
different than that they are a measure
of size relative to each other so we
were doing planning poker this morning
where um we were looking at grapes
versus apples and then we were looking
at oranges and and what else do we have
watermelons and coconuts and we weren't
trying to figure out how much time it
would take to eat grapes as opposed to
how much time it would uh take to eat a
coconut it's clear that it's going to
take longer to eat a coconut because
there's more effort involved so we have
a sense that it's going to take more
time but comparing the coconut to our
BAS line of two right we came up with a
baseline of two for the smallest user
story We compare eating coconuts to that
Baseline and we say okay you know what
it's going to take more effort to uh eat
the coconut than it is to eat grapes or
apples
um so you can do it like we did you can
also
triangulate um for example when we did
our planning project this morning or
this morning for me rather at the
beginning um oh that's not it that is
the daily standup here it
is if I had said Team I want you to pick
a small user story a medium user story
and a large user story
um and then we would then compare other
stories to those three and so we would
kind of triangulate on it um let's say
that we did uh you know two was
small uh I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong
grapes was small apples were medium and
coconuts were large well if we then
looked at Orange and we said well you
know orange
is um smaller than Apples but bigger
than grapes so we would know this would
fit in between grapes and
apples
um and so let's say you know we had
apples at five and grapes at two then we
would say an orange is probably going to
be
three and the values you know now I used
um in our example the modified Fibonacci
series uh what we do in scrum and agel
ifer using story points we're going to
use um a nonlinear scale for the values
so down at the
bottom here there's the modified
Fibonacci Sequence the way the Fibonacci
sequence works by the way
um um it's
the the value is the sum of the two on
the right so let me break this right
here because this is a modified
Fibonacci so 13 is 5 5 + 8 8 is 3 + 5 5
is 2+ 3 and 3 is 1 + 2 if we were doing
the real Fibonacci series this wouldn't
be 20 it would be 13 + 8 which would be
21 um and I don't know why some use
modified Fibonacci and others not but
that's just kind of a common thing to do
if you're doing planning poker you give
everybody seven cards 1 2 3 5 8 13 and
20 um another nonlinear scale is
doubling 1 2
486 um you typically don't go too far to
the left with the values because um that
either means that you're being too
granular or you've got stories that are
probably too big and they need to be
disaggregated now somebody just chatted
here um should some buffer time be
included in the actual
estimates
um let me answer that question first by
going back to Ideal Time and then I'm
going to come back to story points and
answer the question when we're
estimating in ideal time we don't add a
special amount of time that we would
call a buffer we just allow for the
distractions and the interruptions which
could look like a buffer right you're
saying you know um you know Priyanka if
um based on your duties in the
organization and our uh work day of8
hours you're typically available to be
doing your project work five out of
those eight hours so when we are
converting ideal time to elapse time um
you know we will be building in extra
time based on distractions and
interruptions we would not call it a
buffer but that's essentially what we're
doing now when it comes to user stories
that we're using story points it is
different um the points are for the
entire amount of the work and why might
we need to have some extra time for a
user story well it's likely going to be
driven by uncertainty there might be
other uh things that impact it but
that's the main
thing sorry
team so when the team is estimating the
size of the user story they will be
including in their discussion and
estimates any extra time or buffer time
that would be needed for uh that user
story to be completed so do we
accommodate um uncertainty when we're
using story points yes we're looking at
the The X Factor and if we've got an
unstable user story then we're probably
going to um say you know this is going
to be a bigger user story than one
that's similar but has a a much lesser
level of
uncertainty uh um so that's the story
points let's compare the
two um Ideal Time uses things like hours
and days which is easier to explain
outside the team right the suits like
things in days and hours everybody's
estimate may be different not a bad
thing it's easier to do at the beginning
because we're oriented to think about
time um and it does kind of shine a
light on wasted time story point
um are harder to explain outside the
team um you know the suit says well um
how long is it going to take to do user
story 301 and our answer is um well
that's a 10 user story Point user story
and the suit saying what does that mean
tell me how long it's going to take um
so the suits have to be converted to uh
uh story points now here's the thing
it's a lot easier to get consensus when
we're estimating in story points and
once we get good at it it's going to be
much
faster we have to remember it's not
comparable across teams so you know a
team working together will have its own
kind of system for sizing the stories
and another team that might even be
working on the same project will have a
CO a whole different uh scheme and so if
the velocity of one team is 25 and the
velocity of another is 50 it doesn't
mean that the team with the velocity of
50 is able to do more work than the
teams whose velocity is
25 and we did um when we got our day
going um we started with um uh a
planning poker exercise and so you know
we used all of the team members so we
selected the team the product owner was
there to answer any questions um the
team discussed each of the story cards
and then um decided what their vote was
going to be and then everybody voted at
once if there were outliers they were
discussed and um the reasons for that uh
those variances those outliers um were
then part of the discussion and then we
did another round of voting and we would
keep doing that until we had our
estimates converge or we reached
consensus on them
okay so advantages of planning poker
it's fun it's quick it gets the whole
team involved the the team understands
um a little bit about all of the stories
everybody contributes his or her
expertise and the discussion during the
estimation provides Clarity in the
direction approach and even a bit of
design if we were in the same room team
and we were doing a planning poker
activity like we did uh at the beginning
of our day uh together um we would be
able to you know model it a little bit
better or if we tried to unmute
everybody but you could hear the
background noise I've tried doing it it
doesn't really work but you get the idea
that if the team's discussing and things
like that you would actually get to the
point where um your estimates would
converge and the team would say okay
this user story size is you know
whatever it
is okay so we need to wrap things up for
the day so we are ending right here and
that means tomorrow when we get together
we're going to be doing slide 20 you're
starting with that which is Affinity
estimating and let's see Affinity
estimating we go through that we're
going to talk about tracking progress
using um information radiators and then
we're going to talk about what we do
when we find variances between the plan
and the actual results and then we'll
have our quiz now let's talk about the
values of scrun now this is different
than pillars this is um values so there
are five um values for that
and this is something that I want you to
memorize so I'm going to switch my
cameras here and go to the
Whiteboard and we're going to
add to our
list Oh wrong color you can you can tell
I'm a project manager because that would
bother
me so the
five values of
scrum and there's an acronym you can see
that on the screen right C
Force okay so
five values of scrub
um and
CF o r
c and you kind of know my style here you
don't have to do it this way you know
whatever works for you but have some
kind of a strategy for memorizing things
will probably serve you
well so the um the first C is
commitment the next one there are four
four F is
focus o is
openness is that two ends or one I don't
know open this we'll blame it on the
marker if it's not right um R is for
respect and the last C
is
courage and so there's your little chart
right there and um let me just briefly
go over
these um none of these will be a big
surprise here um we've talked about some
of them already in one context or
another um so the for commitment that
means the commit the team is going to
commit to deliver value to the
customer um they're on board there's the
Buy in all of that's there Focus the
team is going to focus on the few
important
things
um at a time so we're going to do time
boxing uh we're not going to do things
broadly specifically uh focus on a few
things at a time o is openness that's
analogous to the T transparency and the
pillars meaning we're going to be
completely open in Sharing um
information about project our own
opinions our fears our concerns Etc our
stands for respect and that's kind of a
360 view we respect ourselves we respect
others we respect the uh Concepts that
we are using as part of scrum and
um um and you and we respect the other
stakeholders as well 360 and the last C
stands for courage and that's the
courage to make commitments uh even when
we're in an uncertain
environment
um courage to deal with um fear that
comes from a failure uh courage to uh
share disagreements openly yet
respectfully um courage to participate
in debating technical approaches
Etc okay so now let's go to the scrum
life cycle chart and what I want to do
is I want to elaborate on this just a
little
bit and I'm going to try and use my
mouse to do some some uh additions to
this um first of all we have the product
backlog the product backlog has to be
kept current and we call that grooming
grooming is adding user stories and
removing user stories
from the product backlog product backlog
is the scope of the project the product
owner owns that the team assists in that
effort related to grooming is pruning
pruning the backlog is prioritizing and
reprioritizing so the product backlog is
pruned and groomed regularly throughout
the course of the project
now there is a meeting that takes place
right here which is called the the
Sprint planning meeting can I just do
PSP here Sprint planning meeting okay
that is one of the ceremonies or events
that
um takes place in scrum in the um the
Sprint planning
meeting it is a Time boxed event and it
is time boxed to two hours for each week
of the Sprint so in our example here we
have a 30-day Sprint so if we have a
4-week Sprint then our Sprint planning
meeting will be eight hours in
duration and two things happen during
the Sprint planning meeting the user
stories that are going to be included in
the Sprint are selected right they're
put into the Sprint backlog which is a
subset of the product backlog containing
the user stories that are going to be
completed during the Sprint and the
second thing that happens during the
Sprint planning meeting is the selected
user stories are then disaggregated into
tasks and
estimated once that's done then the work
of the Sprint begins there will be a
daily scrum like we did at the beginning
of our workday together as our team and
then at the end of of the work of the uh
Sprint there will be the Sprint
review the Sprint review meeting or
ceremony is also time boxed and it is
time boxed to one
hour for each week of the Sprint so if
we're doing a four-week Sprint the
Sprint review meeting would be 4 hours
in length the primary purpose of the
review is to showcase and demo the
software and get feedback from relevant
stakeholders and allow the product owner
to say I accept or I reject the work
that has been
done then after that is the Sprint
retrospective now this is where the
team asks and answers three questions
what went well what did not go well and
what are we going to do different spr
going
forward regarding the previous Sprint
that was just completed and the ones
that is is just coming
up um and then the uh the Sprint itself
will result in working software or value
for the customer and then of course
everything goes back and repeats for as
many Sprints uh as necessary to complete
the scope of the project
um let's see I see a chat here how
similar or different is the product
backlog to SRS software requirement
specs document which is widely used in
projects um it's different um and if you
will hang on to that question um we're
going to have a discussion later on
about user stories and that will help
you understand uh the differences um and
we'll get into the user stories that
come from the customer and user stories
that come from the text domain and that
will help answer your question so you
okay hanging on to
that okay great
thanks okay so um a little bit more
detailed view of the scrum Project Life
Cycle now let's talk about a couple
other things here when it comes to um a
Sprint there are some things that affect
the duration of the Sprint so the team
is going to have to decide how long each
of the Sprints are going to be and
things that are a factor include the
stability of the product backlog If the
product backlog is changing a great deal
um then that's going to argue for
shorter
durations um because there's uh a high
level of uncertainty and so you have a
greater amount of control on your
project if you have shorter Sprints now
on the other hand another factor is the
cost of iterating every time we do a
Sprint there are costs associated with
the Sprint planning meeting the Sprint
review the Sprint retrospective right
people show up to those meetings you got
to pay them and um excuse me so there
there is an overhead cost to actually
doing sprints the goal of the Sprint is
working software at the and the end
product should be near releasable or
potentially shippable now there might be
working software that the product owner
isn't going to want to release um maybe
because it as a standalone component of
working software for the system doesn't
create any value or any usability for
end users uh and maybe you wait till the
end of a release before you release
everything but the idea is is this
working software and it could be
released if um the customer wanted to do
that
um sorry I just dropped
something I see a question there I will
Circle back to your question in just a
sec um the Sprint duration and
deliverables do not change once the team
has committed this is another one of
those things that has to be viewed as as
absolute when we're doing scrum so if we
say that we're going to do a twoe Sprint
and we select five user stories based on
our velocity or capacity once that
decision has been made the duration of
the Sprint does not change and we do not
add or remove any user
stories now it could be possible for the
product owner to cancel a Sprint but
that would
extreme that would be because there is
such a major change to the product
backlog that the work of the current
Sprint is going to be completely
irrelevant you don't change the Sprint
you cancel the Sprint and then the
bottom one here the Sprint begins with
planning and ends with review and a
retrospective and there was a question
here are there any issues with combining
the retrospective and the planning
ceremonies and the answer to that is yes
now could they be combined depending on
the environment the answer is yes and
the way we would arrive at whether or
not it would make sense is who's going
to be
participating um but they would be
separate agendas so the agenda for the
retrospective is what went well what did
not go well what are we going to do
different and the mandatory participants
for that meeting are the the the team
the scrum team is the scrum Master going
to be there likely as a facilitator um
is the product owner going to be there
maybe maybe not if the product owner is
there you know the product owner could
maybe answer questions and help clarify
but the product owner does not weigh in
on what went well what did not go well
and what are we going to do differently
that is all owned by the team in the
planning meeting the product owner has
to be there and the product owner is the
main driver of that meeting um the
product owner is talking about or
dealing with the priority the user
Stories the team's weighing in maybe
there's some dependencies that need to
be considered but um the product owner
has to make the hard decisions with
regards to what's going to be done in
the next Sprint based on the constraints
from the team like velocity um and
technology and sequencing and things
like that so um I kind of answered that
from a real world point of view yes it
could be it's not desirable on the test
they are completely
separate did I get you
there I'll keep my eye on the chat box
make sure I got that answered well
enough for you and let's move
ahead okay the Sprint planning meeting
this is uh looking right down here this
is conducted at the beginning of a new
Sprint it's attended by the team the
product owner and the scrub master and
there are two approaches is to deciding
what's going to be included in the
Sprint it can be based on commitment and
it can also be based on
velocity and the goal here is to get
team Buy in make sure that there is um
Clarity between the team and the product
owner as to what the definition of done
looks like for the user stories that are
going to be included in the
Sprint and um of course it should be
realistic and achievable and you know
there can be a little bit of of um an
issue where you've got you know a
well-meaning product owner that's
driving really hard and the team says
you know we can do these Sprints and the
product owner is saying no come on you
got to do at least one more I got to
have this one in this Sprint um you
could get a question like that and it
might be what would the scrub Master do
if you had a Dom product owner that's
trying to persuade the team to do more
than the team thinks it can
do um and that's where the scrum Master
comes in the scrum Master plays the role
of the mentor the coach and uh you know
assisting in the resolution of those
kinds of issues without deciding the
scrum Master is not a decider the team
decides uh when it comes to how and the
product owner decides when it comes to
what okay
the scrum meeting uh daily scrum we've
talked about it right the entire team
attends the meeting could the product
owner be there yes does the product
owner need to be there no sometimes the
product owner can be uh you know an
impediment to the meeting um but would
be welcome but if the product owner
started asking questions or became the
focus of questions being asked uh the
scrum Master would have to help
facilitate a change because um that
would not be effective for the daily
scrum duration 15 minutes we talked
about that and the agenda what did I do
yesterday what am I going to do today
and what are my
impediments the Sprint
review now who attends it's going to be
the team the product owner the scrum
master and potentially others
so optionally others you know that we
would want to get feedback from would be
end users um oper ations folks the suits
um all of those would be welcome
depending on the relevance of the
software that's being demoed and being
um uh subject to the acceptance testing
and the product owner you know giving
the thumbs up or the thumbs down when it
comes to acceptance the duration for
this we mentioned this before it's not
just a flat two hours it's one hour per
week so if you did a four-week Sprint
you would plan on the review being a
maximum of 4 hours in duration the
agenda is to demo the completed software
get feedback and then see where we are
when it comes to the the release plan
the retrospective who is there it's
attended by the team and I would modify
this slightly and I would say this is
the the mandatory group that needs to be
there um optionally the scrum Master
would be there potentially you could
have an external facilitator the role of
the scrum Master would be the
facilitator now um a good scrub Master
being a facilitator in a retrospective
would have some knowledge of control
charts the five
y's um um Ishikawa diagrams things like
that and although the scrum Master would
not be participating in the actual use
of the tools the scrum Master would be
facil fa itting the effective use of
those
tools um when it comes to duration the
rule is 45 minutes for each
week oh that was a good four that was
kind of a lousy
five so if you had a uh two week um uh
Sprint then you would have an hour and a
half retrospective
Max and what's the purpose there's H the
agenda for the retrospective three
questions what worked well what did not
go well what are we going to do
different and it's not just a chat
session well that would be part of it
you will use tools and techniques um
like some that I mentioned control
charts
um Ishikawa
diagrams
um five wise there's a number of things
that you might use uh in order to
surface uh assignable causes for issues
so that we could then come up with a
resolution to
those um this is where continuous
Improvement um is uh going to happen um
you know continuous Improvement is the
result of other things but this is the
main thing and if you were get a
question about the relevance or the
necessity of retrospectives there is no
equivocation you do a retrospective
after every Sprint um if you don't do a
retr um if you don't then um there's no
improvement um you know things just stay
static okay so we talked about the four
main ceremonies right in uh a scrum
project Sprint
planning you with me daily standup the
Sprint
review and then the Sprint
retrospective all considered mandatory
for effectively doing scrum and not
doing them uh or one of them would be
considered a
sale okay artifacts that we use when it
comes to scrum uh we've talked about the
product backlog we talked about the
Sprint backlog there's also um a release
backlog uh depending on the size of the
project it might be advisable to uh
group user stories into releases um if
you have have a product road map uh your
releases would line up for that um for
example I've got a um uh a real life
project that I'm working on and my
product road map is um uh got three
versions it's a website um the first uh
version is free uh the second version
includes a membership component and the
third uh version includes um a referral
commission uh portion to it and so I
will then uh do three releases I'll have
all the user stories that will result in
version one all the the user stories
that result in version two so that's
what the release uh backlog is and so if
you look at it in sequence the product
backlog is the overall scope of the
project the release backlog is a subset
of the product backlog and then the
Sprint backlog would be a subset of the
release
backlog the product backlog might look
something like this um it's a list of
user stories that are written by the
product owner and are going to be
developed by the um team members and
didn't we have we had a product backlog
for the thing that we did this morning
right so here's another example of a
product backlog um um this is more of a
list um and just has the title there
would be a user story card for each of
the items in the product
backlog um but the idea would be it
would be prioritized uh there could be
user stories that are added or removed
depending on what the product owner
wants product owner owns the product
backlog um that's a given uh does the
product owner create all the user
stories for the product backlog in
isolation no absolutely not because
there are technical considerations that
the product back or the product owner
might not um even consider the product
uh owner's perspective is more the
customer side the end user side um and
so the product owner might not even
think of things like security or
architecture related things um and there
might even be uh user stories that come
from the technical domain that need to
be uh developed before some of the uh
products owners user
stories another artifact is the
definition of done the definition of
done is primarily a
checklist and this is what forms the
agreement between the product owner and
the
team uh
as to when we consider something
completely
done and if we look down here it's um uh
where's my I'm looking for my cursor it
says here it's usually prepared by the
scrum master and consultation with the
team
um that is I would modify this slightly
um the definition of done is really
driven by the team that see the scrum
Master is never a decision maker if you
have a scrum Master that's saying we
have to have this in the definition of
done then that's an infringement on the
empowerment of the team I agree that
this the scrum Master is a part of the
effort to develop the definition of done
um but I would kind of flip that uh the
scrum Master is the facilitator it's the
team that still um owns that so um now
is the product owner involved in this
absolutely because the product owner is
involved in defining the story and what
a fully implemented story looks like so
here's a
list a short list of what a definition
of done could look like the story has
been fully implemented or the code
completed as
described um automated unit tests have
been developed with at least 80% code
coverage
um it could be more than that um this is
just an example automated unit tests and
acceptance test of the story are passing
no severity has one or two
defects and then high priority test
cases have been automated and added to
the regression
Suite um the definition of done we point
out is likely to evolve as the team's
maturity increases as the project
advances
there are three distinct roles in scrum
the scrum Master the product owner and
the development team the scrum Master
assists both the development team and
the product owner the scrum Master works
with the product owner to maximize
return on
investment the scrum Master empowers the
development team by fostering creativity
removing impediments and coaching and
mentoring as appropriate the product
owner is responsible for project success
by defining the project Vision
requirements and
priorities the product owner has to
resist the temptation to manage the team
or add more important work after a
Sprint has
begun the product owner has to be
willing to make the hard choices during
Sprint
planning the development team is
comprised of five to nine members with a
mix of roles and has the autonomy to
self organized and choose how best to
meet the goals of the product owner and
is responsible for the same a scrum
Master is a skilled servant leader a
scrum master has very little formal
Authority however he or she is expected
to assist the team achieve the intended
outcomes without interfering with the
team's
autonomy the scrum Master facilitates
the scrum ceremony such as Sprint
planning daily standup Sprint review and
Sprint
retrospective the scrum Master removes
obstacles or impediments faced by the
team the scrum Master is also a process
coach and Mentor the scrum Master must
not be a line manager of the team the
scrum Master is not to be a Taskmaster
either the scrum Master is not a
technical or design Authority nor is he
or she a decision maker for the team
throughout the course of the proc
project the scrum Master must not do
anything to rob the team of its
empowerment and ability to
self-organize let's talk about the
attributes of a scrum Master scrum
Masters need to exhibit responsibility
even though they are not solely
accountable for the team's output they
will consider it their responsibility to
remove anything that impacts the team's
productivity they will try to enable the
team to do the best that it can
they are
humble they will work in the background
and let the team take all the glory they
will use we statements and seldom use
any I
statements they are able to set aside
their ego and shower all their attention
on the
team they are by Nature collaborative
they will encourage the team to have
conversations among each other and with
other stakeholders outside the team they
will nudge all the right people into
getting involved and work together in
trying to solve problems they are
committed to the team cause even if
being a scrum Master is a part-time task
for them they will give the highest
priority to the team's needs hence the
scrum Masters work allocation especially
if they are part-time needs to take this
into
consideration they are able to influence
they are naturally good communicators
and able to convince others to adopt
different approaches they apply various
techniques to mobilize organizational
resources when required walk the
political tight RPP when required and in
general do whatever it takes to get the
team the assistance it
needs they are
knowledgeable it is clear that as
process coaches for the team scrum
Masters need to be experts in the method
they may not be the technical or domain
expert
however they are knowledgeable enough to
be able to have productive conversations
about the project being done by the team
tasks for the scrum Master the scrum
Master is a crucial role and it is
important for you to be able to be clear
about exactly how the scrum Master
serves the team scrum Masters are
servant leaders this means that they put
the team before themselves and assist
the team for example they set up Ure
that the scrum ceremonies are
effectively carried out they ensure that
there is smooth flow of information
within and outside the team and that
there is a spirit of collaboration in
decision making and problem solving
scrum Masters must make it their mission
to resolve issues that hinder team
progress it doesn't matter what the
nature of the issue is a scrum Master
needs to mobilize the right resources
within the organization to resolve those
issues in a timely manner and escalate
promptly if that does not
happen we need to understand that in the
short duration of a Sprint even a few
hours of being stuck can make the
difference between a successful and
unsuccessful
Sprint scrum Masters protect the team
they ensure that the team is not
Disturbed or asked to deviate from their
commitments if pressure mounts due to
unreasonable expectations they will step
in and push back on the team's behalf
they will also play the role of
Peacemaker when conflict arises by
encouraging the parties to focus on the
issue discuss the issue with an open
mind and resolve the conflict finally
scrum Masters are the process coaches of
the team they use their understanding of
agile methods and scrum in particular to
guide the team through the dos and
don'ts of
scrum they ensure that the team stays
true to the principles of Agile
development scrum Master roles scrum
teams before we discuss the role of a
developer on a scrum team let's talk
about the desirable characteristics of
scrum teams they should be small and
Nimble team size should be no less than
three and no more than nine so that
would be six plus or minus three
exceptions are possible but uncommon
the small attribute makes the team
Nimble and improves productivity it
avoids the phenomenon Mike con calls
social loafing and instead produces
focus on work the team size should be
just large enough that the team members
are able to produce and showcase a
significant increment of work at the end
of each Sprint Sprint after
Sprint self-sufficient and CR
functional for example if a team needs
user interface development skills
database expertise and service expertise
all of those skills must be present on
the
team ideally team members are
generalizing Specialists team members
should not only be an expert or a
specialist at one aspect of the
development effort but should also have
enough skills and knowledge to fill in
in other roles as necessary for example
if you are a UI developer you should be
able to Dawn the Hat of a Services
developer if
needed if a large team is to be split up
into smaller scrum teams scrum favors
feature teams over component
teams autonomous and
self-organizing teams choose for
themselves how they are going to
organize and meet the goals of the
product owner no no one gets to dictate
to the team how to get their work
done the team decides in collaboration
with the product owner the project
Direction and the pros and cons of
different
approaches let's talk about some key
decision points or factors to consider
when assembling scrum teams feature
teams over component teams the first
issue is whether it's best to align team
members based on features or components
scrum favors feature teams over
component teams for example it's best to
avoid putting all of the UI developers
together and all of the API or Services
developers together why because each
feature or user story will require both
the UI and services or API organizing
based on components will reduce the
incentive to collaborate the only reason
component teams may be justified would
be if the components are likely to be
used by multiple other
teams assemble the right people it's
important to get the right mix of people
together for the team the right level of
Technical and domain expertise teams
will naturally have both senior and
junior level developers this works
perfectly as there will be stuff that is
more appropriate for the junior
developers and stuff that is not also
one of the risks of a small team is that
the team may miss out on broader
perspective and dissenting views one way
to work around this is to deliberately
favor diversity in all aspects gender
ethnicity personality traits Etc it may
take some time for the team to advance
through the storming stage of Team
development and develop the trust
necessary to work effectively together
but it can be done once a team has been
formed it's best to preserve and assign
whole teams rather than individuals to
projects it's to avoid assigning team
members to multiple projects at the same
time distributed team a distributed team
may be
unavoidable those based at the same
geographical location should be
collocated in the same team room and
Technology processes and ground rules
should be put in place to overcome the
disadvantages of all team members not
being
collocated plotting team size and
productivity will likely result in an
scurve you can see here that a team can
actually be too small or too large
Remember The Sweet Spot is six plus or
minus
three think of scrum as a lightweight
framework that utilizes principles and
practices that assist teams in
delivering working software in short
Cycles to the customer enabling rapid
feedback continuous Improvement and
quick response to change
it promotes delivering value as in
working software to the customer in an
incremental and iterative way it is not
a process or technique for developing
software rather it is a framework within
which various processes techniques and
practices are employed in scrum the
iterations that deliver working software
to the customer are called
Sprints in each iteration or sprint
results in potentially shippable
software this slide is a graphical
representation of an agile project using
scrum starting at the left you can see
that the product owner owns the product
backlog and in collaboration with the
team develops the user stories or
requirements for the project the product
backlog is prioritized with the higher
priority items occupying the top of the
product backlog
log in collaboration with the product
owner the team decides how to group the
user stories into releases based on the
product road
map once the release planning has been
completed the user stories are then
selected for a
Sprint the duration of the Sprint is
going to be 2 to four
weeks once the Sprint backlog has been
determined the team then disaggregates
each user story into tasks during each
Sprint the user stories are
developed as the code is written it is
integrated into the system and daily
scrums are held at the end of a Sprint
there is a Sprint review where the
working software is demonstrated and
presented to the customer for acceptance
the team then conducts a Sprint
retrospective during the retrospective
the team looks at primarily three things
what went well what did not go well and
what should be done differently going
forward the team velocity is then
updated as are the information radiators
which transparently display the status
and progress of the project and then the
cycle repeats itself until the project
is
complete a Sprint is an iteration in
scrum at the beginning of a project the
scrum team determines the duration of
Sprints for the project most Sprints are
going to be two to four weeks in
duration factors affecting Sprint
duration include the stability of the
product backlog once a Sprint has begun
the duration is never changed nor are
any user stories added or removed
therefore if many changes are expected a
shorter Sprint duration would be
best however if the product backlog is
relatively stable a longer Sprint
duration may be
appropriate overhead there are overhead
costs associated with each Sprint for
example every Sprint's going to have a
Sprint planning meeting a Sprint review
and a Sprint retrospective if a team has
been able to lower these overhead costs
by automated testing continuous
integration Etc these costs can be
absorbed more easily making shorter
Sprints more
desirable however if these overhead
costs remain high the team may need to
use longer duration
Sprints a team may be tempted to extend
the duration of Sprints in an effort to
hide their
inefficiencies remember
agile projects favor shorter duration
Sprints and it is the scrum Master's
responsibility to coach and Mentor the
team so it can reduce waste
irregularities and overuse and make the
Sprint shorter the goal of a Sprint is
to deliver working software at the
conclusion of each Sprint the team
should be able to deliver near
releasable or potentially shipable
software this is not easy especially for
an existing product with a lot of Legacy
features but it can be done with the
right technical practices and mature
development processes once the Sprint
duration has been determined and the
user stories for the Sprint have been
selected the duration of the Sprint
cannot be altered nor can any user
stories be added or removed the Sprint
will end at the appointed time
irrespective of whether the team has met
the Sprint goals or not this allows for
Effective continuous Improvement if the
team is unable to deliver the working
software is planned the team will have
to figure out why that happened and then
make changes to improve going
forward the product owner may choose to
cancel or terminate a Sprint in specific
situations for example a significant
change in priorities or a midcourse
correction May render the current Sprint
backlog
invalid given that we are only talking
about a couple of weeks of work the
cancellation of a Sprint would be an
extremely rare event a Sprint will begin
with a Sprint planning meeting and end
with a Sprint review and
retrospective there are three backlogs
used in scrum the product backlog the
release backlog and the Sprint backlog
the product backlog is the master
container of all the user stories for
the project the product backlog is
continually pruned or prioritized so
that maximum value is delivered to the
customer the release backlog is a subset
of the product backlog releases support
the product road map and each release is
populated with user stories necessary
for that release the Sprint backlog is a
subset of the release backlog and
contains the user stories to be
developed in the Sprint as we said the
product backlog contains the user
stories for the entire project and it is
the responsibility of the product owner
user stories are features functions or
requirements that deliver value to the
customer customer however the product
backlog will also have to contain
technical or nonfunctional user stories
necessary for the system to work
properly the product backlog may also
include risk or defect related user
Stories the product owner is responsible
for keeping the product backlog current
and up to dat this is accomplished by
pruning the backlog which is
prioritizing and
reprioritizing the product backlog must
also be con continually groomed this is
the process of adding and removing user
stories based on the needs and desires
of the customer there are four scrum
ceremonies the Sprint planning meeting
the daily scrum the Sprint review and
the Sprint
retrospective let's take a detailed look
at each of these ceremonies the Sprint
planning meeting is time boxed at two
hours for each week of the Sprint if the
Sprint is going to be two weeks in
duration then the time box will be 4
hours if the Sprint is going to be four
weeks in duration then the time box for
the Sprint planning meeting will be
eight hours it should be attended by the
complete scrum team including all roles
the most important aspects of this
meeting are the team's capacity and the
definition of
done there are two approaches to
selecting user stories for a Sprint one
is based on the velocity of the team the
other is commitment driven team Buy in
is critical and the goals of the Sprint
should be clearly understood and the
desired outcome should be clearly
articulated with the definition of done
then there's the daily scrum the time
box for the daily scrum is 15 minutes
regardless of the duration of the Sprint
length the entire scrum team including
all roles should attend the daily scrum
each development team member in
individually answers three questions
what did I do yesterday what am I going
to do today and what are my
impediments this is how the team members
coordinate their work and the scrum
Master learns of the impediments he or
she should be taken care of the Sprint
review takes place at the end of the
Sprint and is time boxed at 1 hour for
each week of the Sprint so if the Sprint
were four weeks in duration the Sprint
review meeting would be 4
hours it should be attended by the
complete scrum team including all roles
plus any other stakeholders who are
interested in project
success the purpose of the review is to
demonstrate working software and obtain
and assess
feedback feedback May range from Full
acceptance of the completed software to
complete
rejection the Sprint retrospective takes
place after the conclusion of the Sprint
review and is time boxed at 45 minutes
for each week of the
Sprint so if the Sprint has two weeks in
duration then the retrospective would be
1 and a half hours in length it should
be attended by the complete scrum team
including all roles however the product
owner's attendance is considered
optional during the retrospective the
team answers four
questions what worked well what did not
work well
what should be done
differently and what still puzzles
us one or several problem detection
techniques may be used in the
retrospectives and this ceremony is a
vital part of continuous Improvement at
the conclusion of the retrospective the
teams of velocity and the Project's
information radiators are updated then
the next Sprint planning meeting takes
place and this cycle continues until the
project is complete
the definition of dun is an important
artifact for a scrum team it is the
primary reporting mechanism for team
members and their may be a different
definition of dun at various levels
definition of dun for a feature or user
Story the definition of done for a
Sprint and the definition of done for a
release it's really just a checklist of
activities that add verifiable and
demonstrable value to the product it's
created by the scrum master in
consultation with the team a sample list
of the items for the definition of done
criteria is given here the story is
fully implemented or code completed as
described automated unit tests have been
developed with at least 80% code
coverage automated unit tests and
acceptance tests in the story are
passing high priority test cases have
been automated and added to the
regression
Suite note this is only meant to be an
example each team's definition of done
will vary slightly depending on the
maturity of the team and the specific
situation of the
team the product team has taken up a new
project called WeatherMaster the team is
planning to move to scrum methodology
and this is an outline of its first
scrum meeting time box to 15 minutes
Rick is the scum master of this meeting
where the team members discuss what they
did yesterday their plans for today and
the impediments they faced all team
members are standing up including Todd
who's joined the meeting via video chat
Rick holds the meeting near a scrum
board Angela the product owner is absent
Rick reiterates that all discussions
would be parked until after the scrum
meeting and encourages his team to keep
the meeting short people can chime in to
resolve
obstacles hi hi team welcome to the
Daily standup meeting for the product
team on Project WeatherMaster we are in
Sprint 1 and today is the second day as
we are planning to transition to scrum
methodology I hope you will find this
daily standup meeting helpful in this
meeting you will provide information
about what you did yesterday what you
plan to do today and what challenges you
faced I think everyone's here let's
start I don't see Angela shouldn't she
be here I did add Angela as an optional
attendee to this meeting and since she
hasn't showed up we don't have to wait
for her
Susan scrum doesn't provide a specific
yes or no about the product owner's
participation in the daily scrum the
Po's primary role is to provide
Direction and clarify requirements and
priorities since we don't always discuss
those in detail at this meeting the PO
is not required to be here if the POS
want to attend they are generally in
listen only mode for the duration of the
meeting they can use the information
gathered during the meeting for separate
offline conversations
[Music]
[Music]
what about Todd he works from his home
office right Todd will be a part of the
meeting through video chat it is
important that we include every team
member in the meeting
hi Todd how are you I'm fine thanks am I
audible yes Todd team let's all stand up
for the meeting
[Music]
[Music]
why don't you go first
Aaron yesterday I was working on
creating the mock objects to mask the
database calls from the unit tests the
difficulty with this approach is that
our serers side logic is so dependent on
the metadata that writing a true mock is
a mammoth exercise there are decisions
that are taken during runtime based on
the data some of the stored procedure
calls are also made based on the values
returned through inline queries that are
also embedded in the
code I was debugging the code until
about 900 p.m. but for the life of me I
couldn't figure this out Aaron could we
request you to be concise when you
provide an update if you think some of
the details you descri might be
interesting to others why don't you
write a Wiki page on it and share the
link so getting back to your update did
you finish the task
yesterday no it turned out to be much
more complex than I had imagined I'll
continue to work on it today and see if
I can figure out an XML structure to
mock the schema and hardcode some return
values but I am really stuck as far as
the inline queries are
concerned I know what you're talking
about there is a reason why the inline
queries are there in the code
this is mainly for performance reasons
when the overheads of making a procedure
call based on a metadata value and then
processing the sorry for the
interruption again guys this is a really
great conversation may I suggest we
write this issue in the parking lot I'm
not sure what you mean by that Rick let
me explain what Aaron just brought up is
a blocking issue team members should
bring these up during the daily scrum so
that everybody knows that one of the
team members is stuck however the daily
scrum is is not necessarily the meeting
where solutions to every obstacle can or
should be found it looks like Mary knows
a thing or two about the issue that
Aaron has brought up let's jot this down
as a parking lot topic this means the
team can have offline conversations
after the daily scrum to track it
down I'm also going to make a note that
will track the impediment Aaron faed
daily until it is removed you should let
me know if I can help in any way right
Aaron is there anything else you would
like to say no I am done
thanks yesterday I worked on developing
the Wizards for bulk order creation I'm
almost done today I need to write code
to handle some of the exception
scenarios before I can get them over to
Susan for testing that's it for me I
guess did you forget to mention any
impediments not really an impediment at
present but I would like to mention that
my computer probably needs to be
upgraded with more RAM it has been slow
for the past few weeks
okay I wrote up some scenarios to test
the book order wizard I'm looking to get
my hands on the code as soon as Mary is
done today I'm also hoping to complete
the company order testing that has been
pending for a while I'm okay for the
moment but I do have one question
shouldn't we all be updating the
taskboard as we
speak we could it is up to you guys if
you think you want to do this during the
meeting if you ask my opinion we should
update the board as soon as we are ready
to move the tasks and not wait for the
meeting this will ensure that the board
is always up to date and also that we
use the meeting time to focus on the
conversations that's a great point Rick
I can't see the board very well from
here anyway so maybe we should find a
way to create an electronic version of
it too at some
point great Point Todd why don't you go
next with your updates all right hey
Rick would you like to know about my
work on the advertising module first or
the integration server whatever the team
decides is fine with me remember this is
really your meeting and I'm only here to
facilitate and ensure we get the most
out of this meeting
[Music]
[Music]
all right then I guess I'll start with
the integration server I would like to
inform everybody that I managed to set
up the integration server that we can
use as a Sandbox to test the code before
checking it in Source control
I'll send everybody a link with some
instructions and credentials I have also
started looking at the stories for the
advertising module it looks like there
are a lot of open statements in the
stores that I don't really understand I
guess I should have been paying more
attention during the Sprint planning I
really need to have a conversation with
Angela about this that is my main
impediment right now I sent her an email
but haven't received a response
yet I don't have anything new to today
I'm almost through with setting up our
project on the freeware tool that I
downloaded yesterday I'll show you guys
a demo in the meeting I set up later
today I'll try to chase down some of
these parking lot items anything else
before we close the
meeting all right that's it for today
have a great day do you have a moment to
chat about the inline queries real quick
the purpose of a scrum meeting is to
keep the team members updated and
resolve any impediments it's an ideal
way to Kickstart the on a positive note
the scrum Master reinforces the sense of
the self-managing team facilitates
communication between team members
brings the team's Focus back to what's
important and supports
Improvement so before we dive into the
differences between scrum and Canan
let's have a look at what exactly scrum
is Scrum is a simple agile project
management framework that is used by
organizations to help teams collab
collaborate handle
unpredictability and complex projects or
products while ensuring the products
delivered are of the highest value it
describes a set of meetings tools and
roles that enable teams to work in sync
and help them structure themselves and
manage their work scrum is one of those
things that's really easy to understand
but very difficult to master and
although scrum is seen to be used
generally by software development teams
its principles and themes are pretty
Universal and can be used with just
about all kinds of
teamwork with scrum teams are able to
learn from their
experiences what worked out what didn't
and things like that they're also able
to organize themselves to handle their
problems effectively and basically
improve themselves by reflecting on
them so how does scrum work
here we have the first component the
product backlog the product backlog
consists of a list of tasks that need to
be completed so that the goals of the
stakeholders are
achieved then the team decides what
tasks from the product backlog they want
to take up and deliver in a 2 to 4 week
period called Sprint hence the name
Sprint
planning next the tasks that were
discussed in the previous phase are
added to the Sprint backlog this is a
set of tasks which will be focused on in
the ongoing
Sprint following this the scrum team
which is usually 5 to9 member strong
will work on these tasks now they also
have regular scrum meetings where they
talk about their victories the issues
they face and what they plan to do in
the next 24 hours
and then they have the Sprint review the
Sprint review is a meeting during which
the team shows what they accomplished
during the Sprint now during this time
questions are asked observations
feedback and suggestions are made the
product owner also gets feedback for
upcoming Sprints from
stakeholders they also have a Sprint
retrospective now during this session P
mistakes potenti itial issues and new
ways to handle them are
identified data from here is
incorporated into the new Sprint
plan the final step is increment here a
workable and usable output is provided
to the
stakeholders so now that we know how
scrum Works let's have a look at can
ban Canan comes from from the Japanese
word Canam which literally means
signboard like scrum Canan is a popular
agile framework that is a visual system
by which the work can be managed with
ease as it
progresses Canan uses something known as
the can ban board to make these things
possible with this you can easily
identify bottlenecks and then fix them
cost effectively at optimal
speeds the main focus with Canan is
transparency since everything related to
the tasks are on the board everyone can
keep themselves updated it also ensures
that teams focus on their current tasks
until they're done this limits the
amount of work that's in
progress so on the can band board work
is divided into smaller more manageable
pieces the work that's needed to be done
is written on a note or card and placed
on a board columns on the board help
represent where each item is with
respect to the workflow now let's have a
look at what these are in
detail let's find out how Canan
works now the board consists of three
major
components there's the to-do list which
represents items that need to be
completed deleted the ongoing column
which represents items that are being
currently worked on and the completed or
the done column now these represent
tasks or items that have already been
completed now although this is a
physical representation of the board
several organizations use software
versions of the board that replaces the
sticky notes with cards that can be
moved from one column to another as work
progresses now an example of such a
software is Trello so if you want to
learn more about Trello you can check
out the link I'll be adding to the live
chat in a
moment at this point you guys must have
realized how similar these two
Frameworks sound so let's run through
some more of their
similarities let's find out how they are
similar firstly they both have
principles of lean and agile
which means reduction of waste and both
of them are time boxed and iterative
approaches that enable product delivery
in an incremental
manner both these Frameworks aim to
reduce the amount of work in
progress this forces the teams to ensure
that they focus on a smaller set of
tasks this also makes blockers and
bottlenecks a little more
visible in both cases the work is
divided into smaller more manageable
units both of these Frameworks use pull
scheduling now this means the products
are only Built based on demand rather
than
forecasts transparency plays a major
role in both these Frameworks by helping
them Drive process
Improvement and in both cases the
release plan is continuously optimized
and finally both these methods aim to
deliver releasable software often and
earlier than
expected so now that we've reached
Midway let me ask you guys a
question do you guys use scrum or cband
in your workplace or do you use these
software for personal reasons what
exactly do you use these for let me know
in the live
chat now let's have a look at how these
two Frameworks are different from one
another firstly let's have a look at
Cadence Cadence refers to the amount of
time in a Sprint or before a release so
when it comes to scrum the entire
project is divided into time constrained
iterations that is into smaller
manageable
units but when it comes to can ban it's
event
driven next criteria we're going to have
a look at is release
methodology in scrum releases take place
after each Sprint which usually takes 2
to 4 weeks to complete for Canan
releases take place in the form of
continuous delivery they happen in such
a way that changes like new features
configuration changes bug fixes and
experiments get to the users in a safe
quick and sustainable
manner next up let's have a look at how
changes are addressed in both these
Frameworks in scrum no change can be
made while the Sprint is in
progress once it's complete changes can
be considered in the Sprint plan and
then add it to the Sprint
backlog with Canan changes can be made
at any time and incorporated into the
workflow now let's consider the metric
that's being measured in scrum for
planning and process Improvement
velocity which is the measure of the
work that can be completed by a team in
a Sprint is the key
metric in can ban lead time is the key
metric this represents the period of
time between a new task appearance in
your workflow and its final departure
from the
system next let's have a look at how
teams work in these Frameworks in scrum
you need a cross functional team to
achieve your goals in a Sprint in Canan
cross functional teams are optional
but specialized teams that focus on
particular aspects of the workflow are
required now let's talk about new
additions in scrum just like handling
changes you can't add any items between
a Sprint or an
iteration in can band new items can be
added to the board as long as there's
capacity available for
it now let's have a look at the job
roles Within These frame Works scrum has
three major job roles product owner
scrum master and scrum team with can ban
you don't have any specific job
roles now let's talk about
representation or moreover let's talk
about how data can be
represented with scrum the Board needs
to be reset once a particular Sprint is
complete with Canan the board stays per
consistent throughout the entirety of
the
project and finally let's have a look at
project link with scrum it's better
suited for longer
projects and with Canan projects that
can be completed in a shorter period of
time are better introduction to Agile
Manifesto the agile Manifesto is a
seminal document in the field of
software development created in 2001 by
17 software developers who sought to
outline a more flexible and efficient
approach to project management and
development it emphasizes individuals
and interactions working software
customer collaboration and responding to
change over traditional processes
documentation contract negotiation and
plan following this Manifesto has since
become the foundation for agile
methodologies promoting a flexible team
oriented approach that values
adaptability and customer satisfaction
above rigid adherence to plans with the
manifesto in mind let's start exploring
the
the four core values of agile the four
core values of agile focus on people and
results rather than rigid processes
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools prioritizing
teamwork and communication above strict
adherence to tools and processes imagine
a team deciding together how to solve a
problem instead of just following a
manual it's like choosing a group
discussion over filling out forms
working software over comprehensive
documentation valuing functional
software that meets user needs over
detailed paperwork think of it as
cooking a meal that tastes good and
serves its purpose rather than writing a
detailed recipe book before the meal is
even made customer collaboration over
contract negotiation emphasizing ongoing
engagement with customers rather than
sticking strictly to initial agreements
it's like working with a home builder
who listens and adapts to your changing
needs during construction instead of
sticking strictly to the original plan
responding to change over following a
plan being open to change and adapting
plans as needed instead of rigidly
following a set path picture a road trip
where you're open to taking a more
scenic route based on new information
rather than sticking to the fastest
route Google Maps suggested initially
these values guide the agile methodology
towards flexibility efficiency and
customer satisfaction the 12 principles
of agile software development the 12
principles of agile software development
as outlined in the agile Manifesto
advocate for customer satisfaction
through early and continuous software
delivery prioritizes getting a
functional product to the customer as
soon as possible then updating it
regularly example A Team releases a
basic version of an app to meet initial
user needs then adds new features based
on feedback welcoming changing
requirements even late in development it
is time consuming to handle large and
complicated work when managing project
activities therefore a better strategy
is to break the task into manageable
sizable chunks in addition it would be
simpler for the team members to see
possible bottlenecks and deal with
delays if the clients were always kept
informed for example if users need a new
feature because their needs have changed
the development team Works to
incorporate it even if it wasn't in the
original plan frequent delivery of
working software according to the agile
methodology working software is
frequently delivered in a shorter amount
of time team members must consistently
raise their performance standards as a
result of this iterative process for
example delivering updates every two
weeks to continuously improve and adjust
the software based on user input
business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project in
order to ensure that the business and
development sides of the project can
communicate effectively and more
importantly collaborate a bridge between
them must be built to facilitate an
intellectual exchange that both parties
can agree on make use of the same tools
you would have used in managing remote
teams for example regular meetings
between the client and the team to
discuss the projects Direction and adapt
as necessary build projects around
motivated individuals give them the
environment and support they need and
trust them to get the job done the
project manager must establish a
supportive and stimulating environment
where team members are free to express
their ideas and make recommendations for
enhancing the output of the group this
results in a massive imp Improvement in
their General performance eventually
aiding the project for example allowing
a developer to choose their tools or
method of working to solve the problem
can lead to more Innovative and
effective Solutions the most efficient
and effective method of conveying
information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation
efficient communication among the
parties concerned is stressed strongly
in the agile Manifesto thanks to
improvements in communication
Technologies it's now simpler instead of
having a a quick conference in the
office or participants can now meet via
video conferencing for example solving
misunderstandings or clarifying
requirements through direct discussion
rather than through emails or reports
working software is the primary measure
of progress delivering a functional
product that pleases the consumer is the
single determinant that can guarantee
success before agile numerous success
metrics decreased the quality of the
finished product for example a team
focuses on Del deling a basic but
operational piece of software first
rather than ensuring every document is
perfect atel processes promote
sustainable development the sponsors
developers and users should be able to
maintain a constant Pace indefinitely
burnout will occur if you work on a
project for a long time it's inevitable
avoid placing too much of a workload on
your employees the value of your project
will be affected so assemble the best
team for the job that will work hard but
refrain from overworking themselves and
endangering the Project's quality for
example instead of pushing for long
hours to meet an unrealistic deadline
the team sets a realistic timeline that
allows for steady progress without
overtime continuous attention to
technical excellence and good design
enhances agility any agile team's main
goal should be to provide value to the
client therefore a multikill team that
can manage all the Project's technical
components and offers the chance for
continual Improvement is crucial for
example regularly refactoring code to
improve its structure without changing
its external Behavior Simplicity the art
of maximizing the amount of work not
done is essential you should avoid
adding extraneous complexity to a
project if you want to complete it
swiftly you can accomplish this in
various ways including by using AER
tools which eliminate busy work and
offer you more significant influence
over all project related decisions for
example developers decide not to add a
feature that only a few users would use
keeping the system more straightforward
and easier to maintain the best
architectures requirements and Designs
emerge from self-organizing teams simply
said a self-organized Workforce with
decision-making autonomy would function
better since each team member would be
responsible for meeting client
expectations rather than a loan project
manager for example a team decides who
will work on what tasks based on each
member's strengths and current workload
rather than having a manager assigned
tasks at regular intervals the team
reflects on how to become more effective
St tunes and adjusts Its Behavior
accordingly agile techniques are
constructed on the notion of iteration
where teams consistently enhance their
game by learning from their previous
wrongdoings project managers should
Inspire team meetings where everyone
evaluates their work and discusses how
to develop their management and
technical skills for example at the end
of each development cycle the team needs
to discuss what they can change change
to work more efficiently in the next
cycle with core values add principles in
mind let's have a look at implications
of agile values and principles the
implications of agile values and
principles revolve around fostering a
culture of flexibility collaboration and
continuous Improvement they lead to
enhanced adaptability to change allowing
teams and businesses to respond swiftly
to Market shifts and customer needs
increased customer satisfaction by
prioritizing customer feedback and
delivering value early and often
improved product quality through
iterative development and a focus on
technical Excellence more efficient and
motivated teams due to empowerment and a
focus on individuals and interactions
these points underline how adopting
agile can transform organizational
workflows and outcomes now let's see
some real world applications of a
innovation in tech companies like
Spotify utilize agile to Foster
Innovation rapidly testing and deploying
new features
adapting to Market changes Netflix
applies agile principles to quickly
adapt to user preferences and
technological advancements maintaining
its market leader position banking
sector agility banks have adopted agile
to improve their Digital Services making
customer transactions smoother and more
secure Healthcare efficiency agel
methodologies help Healthcare Providers
streamline operations and improve
patient care through faster more
responsive Services manufacturing
flexibility ility even in manufacturing
agile enables companies to respond
swiftly to Market demands and supply
chain challenges and there you have it
folks why product backlog is important
the product backlog is a fundamental
component in agile and scrum
methodologies serving as a dynamic
prioritized list of features
enhancements bug fixes and other changes
that are needed to improve a product
prioritization the team can prioritize
tasks based on the the products
requirements and the value they bring to
stakeholders transparency the product
backlog offers a clear view of upcoming
work ensuring everyone understands the
Project's Direction and goals
flexibility it allows for the easy
integration of changes and new ideas
into the product development process
focus with a well-defined list of tasks
the team can concentrate on completing
the most valuable ones first if icy it
enables the team to select work from the
backlog as they have capacity optimizing
workflow and productivity instead of
being overloaded with tasks let's
understand what is a product backlog in
agile the product backlog in agile is
like a big to-do list for a project
specifically for those projects managed
using agile methodologies which are
approaches to software development that
emphasize flexibility collaboration and
customer feedback imagine you're
planning a big party which represents
the final product your to-do list the
product backlog includes everything you
need to do to make the Party happen this
list might include tasks like send out
invitations buy decorations plan the
menu and so on each task is important
for the party to be successful in the
context of a software project this list
includes all the features functions
requirements enhancements and fixes that
need to be addressed to make the final
product meet the customer's needs these
items are typically listed in order of
priority with the most important or
urgent items at the top of the list the
team working on the project will
regularly review this list often in a
meeting called the backlog grooming
session but what is backlog grooming
let's understand what is backlog
grooming backlog grooming is a term
commonly used in agile software
development imagine your are planning a
trip and you have a list of things you
want to do or places you want to visit
your list might include things like
booking flights reserving accommodations
and planning activities now think of
this list as your backlog in agile terms
it's a list of tasks or features that
need to be completed for a project
backlog grooming is like going through
this list regularly to make sure it's
organized prioritized and ready to be
worked on here's how it works Works
reviewing and adding items you start by
looking at the items on your list
backlog and making sure they're still
relevant and needed if there are new
ideas or requirements you add them to
the list prioritizing not all tasks are
equally important you need to decide
which ones should be done first so you
prioritize the items on your list based
on factors like customer needs project
deadlines or business value break down
tasks some items on your list might be
big and complex it's easier to work on
smaller manageable tasks in backlog
grooming you might break down big tasks
into smaller ones so they can be
completed more easily estimating effort
it's important to have an idea of how
much time and effort each task will take
during backlog grooming you might
discuss and estimate the effort required
for each item this helps with planning
and resource allocation ensuring Clarity
everyone involved in the project should
have a clear understanding of what each
task entails backlog grooming provides
an opportunity to clarify any doubts or
questions about the items on the list
keeping it up to date backlog grooming
isn't a one-time thing it's an ongoing
process you should regularly review and
update the backlog as the project
progresses and new information becomes
available
all right so after that as the project
progresses the team selects items from
the top of the product backlog to work
on during each development cycle called
a Sprint now what is Sprint a Sprint is
a time box period usually one four weeks
during which the development team works
on a set of items from the product
backlog to create a potentially
shippable product increment Sprints
provide a focused concentrated effort to
deliver valuable work within a time
frame at the beginning of each Sprint
the team selects a set of items from the
product backlog based on their priority
and capacity to form the Sprint backlog
they commit to completing these items by
the end of the Sprint once the Sprint is
over they review the work and present it
to the stakeholders usually the customer
or client for feedback all right now
let's understand what's in a product
backlog a product backlog serves as a
comprehens ensive checklist for a
project team outlining all the tasks
required to enhance the product's
quality it encompasses various elements
user stories brief narratives detailing
desired features from the perspective of
the end user structured as as a type of
user I want an action so that a benefit
value bugs issues any flaws or
malfunctions within the product are
documented here for resolution costs
these entail specific actions necessary
for fulfilling a user story or
rectifying a bug enhancements
suggestions for improving the product's
functionality or value not necessarily
related to troubleshooting technical
work tasks related to enhancing the
product's technical aspects such as
code-based refinement or software
component updates knowledge acquisition
activities aimed at empowering the team
with essential insights or skills for
making informed decisions such as
research or exploration tasks and there
you have it we've explored the ins and
outs of the product backlog in agile by
understanding its importance and how to
manage it through backlog grooming
you're well equipped to steer your
projects toward success so what is safe
scrum Master certification safe scrum
Master certification is a badge that
shows you know your stuff when it comes
to scrum lean and agile ways of working
it's like a stamp of approval that says
you are great at managing agile projects
especially in big companies to get this
certification you have got to prove your
really understand safe principles and
how to use them in real situations
there's an exam you have to pass called
the safe SSM exam it tests what you know
about the safe framework and how you
would handle different challenges now
let's break it down scrum is a way of
working where teams tackle big projects
in small and manageable steps lean is
all about being efficient and cutting
out waste and agile is a mindset that
focuses on being flexible and responding
quickly to change safe combines all
these ideas and adds a layer for working
in big organizations imagine you're in
charge of a project at a big company you
need to make sure everyone on the team
knows what you are doing and those
things are running smoothly that's where
being a safe scrum Master comes in handy
you will know how to use scrum to break
down the projects into smaller task you
will also use lean principles to keep
things moving quickly and efficiently
and you will have that agile mindset to
adapt to any changes that comes your way
so getting certified as a safe scrum
Master is like saying hey I know my
stuff when it comes to managing agile
projects in big companies it's a way to
show employees that you have got the
skills they need to keep their projects
on track and the teams working smoothly
so this was about safe scrum Master
certification now let's understand about
the exam pattern so understanding about
the exam pattern the safe scrum Master
certification exams follow the specific
pattern designed to access your
understanding here's what you need to
know about the exam so the duration is
90 minutes to complete the exam then
number of questions so there will be a
total 45 questions and to pass the exam
you will need to score at least 33 out
of 45 questions correctly which amounts
to 7 3% now talking about the competency
level the exam is geared towards
individuals at an intermediate
competency level this means you should
be proficient and capable of Performing
task with some assistance now the
question format questions for the exam
will be either multiple choice question
where you have to choose one answer or
multiple select format where you can
choose two or three answers now talking
about the delivery the exam is conducted
online via web based platform it's a
closed book exam meaning you can't refer
to any materials during the test you'll
also not allowed any outside assistance
and remember it's timed so manage your
time wisely now coming to the main part
that is the cost of the exam so the cost
of the first attempt is included in the
course registration fee if you take the
exam within 30 days of completion the
course and however if you need to retake
the exam or if you attempt it after the
30-day window there's a fee for $50 per
attempt so it's like that all right so
this was about the exam pattern now
coming to the career opportunities after
certification so after completing the
safe certified scrum Master
certification you can Target a variety
of job positions that leverage your
knowledge of agile and scrum practices
some of them are scrum Master agile
coach product owner project manager
program manager and iteration manager so
these are the some of the positions you
can opt after doing this certification
all right now let's understand how to
become a safe certified scrum master so
let's divide the procedure or plan into
into Three Steps step one is create a
proper study plan so let's understand
that first so preparing for the safe
certified scrum Master exam starts with
creating a study plan this plan outlines
what you need to focus on first identify
the main goals and the important ideas
for the exam understand the key Concepts
thoroughly this helps you prioritize
your study time and ensures you cover
all the necessary topics to succeed in
the exam so this was about the study
plan now coming to the next step which
is prepare for
safe certified scrum Master exam so
basically the training part for
Preparation purposes consider enrolling
in a safe scrum Master certification
course over 16 hours of live instructor
Le sessions you will delve into the Ines
of scaled agile framework mastering
Agile development at a scale iteration
planning and fostering High performing
teams with a one-ear membership to the
safe Community platform access
invaluable resources to support your
journey professionals who pass the safe
scrum Master certificate an exam from
Simply learn will receive safe scrum
master master certificate safe scrum
Master digital badge for online profiles
and much more you will get the link to
the safe scrum Master certification
course by simply learn in the comment
section below all right now let's talk
about the study material thing so
supplement your learning with the
official course materials including the
safe certified scrum Master guide and
additional resources provided by a
choosen training provider as I've
mentioned you can go through the safe
scrum Master certification by simply
learn and you'll get all the resources
in that particular training course all
right now coming to the next thing that
is the third step which is mock test so
mock test taking mock test is an
important part of preparing for the safe
certified scrum Master exam these
practice tests may make the real exam
helping you get familiar with the format
and types of questions by giving mock
tests you can access your Readiness and
identify areas where you need more
practice it's a great way to build
confidence and improve your chances of
success on the actual exam after that
you can go for test analysis analyzing
mock test is crucial for safe certified
Master exam preparation after taking a
mock test review your answer to
understand where you went right and
where you made the mistakes identifying
the patterns in your errors and focus on
improving those areas this should be
your goal so this analysis helps you
fine-tune your study plan and
strengthens your weak points increasing
your chances of Performing well on the
actual exam and the last step would be
to go for the exam so by following these
steps and maintaining consistency in
your preparation you can confidently
pursue your goal to become a certified
safe scrum Master with a solid study
plan regular mock test and through
analysis you will be equipped to Ace the
exam and Excel in your agile career
Journey why do we need scrum meeting
alignment ensures everyone is on the
same page regarding project goals and
progress transparency promote
transparency by sharing individual
accomplishments plans and op obstacles
collaboration Fosters collaboration
among team members by identifying
dependencies and opportunities for
assistance adaptation allows teams to
adapt and adjust their plans based on
Daily Progress and emerging challenges
efficiency helps in identifying and
addressing issues early preventing
delays and ensuring smooth project flow
moving forward let's dive into
advantages of scrum meeting improved
communication enhances communication
among team members by providing
dedicated forum for updates and
discussions enhance collaboration
promotes collaboration and knowledge
sharing among team members leading to
better problem solving and decision
making increase productivity enables
teams to stay focused and accountable
for daily tasks leading to improved
productivity and progress quick issue
resolution facilitates early
identification and resolution of
obstacles preventing them from becoming
significant impediments to progress
iterative Improvement supports iterative
Improvement by providing regular
opportunities for reflection and
adaptation next let's see standard
questions of scrum meeting question one
what did you do yesterday question two
what will you do today question three
are there any obstacles or impediments
in your way moving forward let's see
facilitation and execution in scrum
scrum Master's role facilitates the
meeting ensuring it stays focused and On
Track Time boxing keeps the meeting
short and concise typically around 50 15
minutes or less adapting format allows
teams to modify the format or questions
to better suit their needs and context
staying standing encourages participants
to stand during the meeting to maintain
focus and keep it brief let's conclude
this video conclusion value proposition
the daily scrum meeting is a valuable
tool for agile teams promoting alignment
transparency collaboration and
continuous Improvement integration with
agile principles it aligns closely with
agile principles of frequent
communication adaptation and
collaboration making it an essential
practice within agile methodologies like
scrum by incorporating these teams can
gain a comprehensive understanding of
the purpose benefits execution and
continuous Improvement aspects of the
daily scrum meeting within the Agile
development framework so as part of this
tutorial we are going to understand the
typical interview questions which would
come across when someone faces the
interview for any of the roles in the
scrum so question number one what is
Scrum so scrum is a framework that
enables team to work together so with
scrum teams can learn from experiences
self-organize working on problems to
reflect on their victories and their
losses to improve so this is a simple
framework which will provide a better
ability and methodology one can able to
handle it better so scrum is very well
defined articulated and this provides a
better insights and capabilities
building EXs is very easier and roles
are well
defined so Define the roles in scrum so
what are the typical roles we come
across in scrum so one of the roles we
come across is product owner so product
owner is primarily responsible for
maximizing the ROI by determining the
product features prioritizing it into a
list what needs to be focused on for the
next print and constantly reprioritizing
and refining it so what happens is
whenever we may require to deliver it is
very important for us to have the
requirements clear what requirements
needs to be fulfilled to fulfill that
requirements the products what is
produced should have a specific features
and
functionalities so product owner will
have the list of features and
functionalities which needs to be
created when product comes out as a
result of a project so product owner
owns this primary responsible to ensure
these list of features are identified
and those are prioritized as
required so next role we can think of is
Scrum master who helps teams learn and
apply scrum to obtain business value so
scrum Master helps removing impediments
impediment is anything which can stop
things to flow smoothly so protects them
from interface and helps the team to
adopt agile practices now scrum is one
of the methodologies for agile
approaches and practices now remember
the term agile itself is not a practice
it it refers to indicate that move
faster become flexible respond to change
be flexible now scrum methodology
especially scrum Master should
understand this Dynamics and ensure the
team understands this and scrum Master
should guide the team to adopt these
methodologies and ensure the results are
accomplished accordingly so next role is
Scrum team so scrum team is a group of
individuals who work together to deliver
the requirements of the stakeholders so
scrum team is generally of the size like
five plus or minus 2 who are
self-organizing so various different
capabilities the scrum team members
would have so each of their capabilities
complement to accomplish the results
required so question number three what
are the responsibilities of the scrum
team so scrum team is self-organizing as
I mentioned earlier so it is a
self-organizing team that has five to
seven members and the responsibilities
would include the development and
delivery of working products during each
Sprint now we're seeing the new
terminology Sprint so what is the
meaning of the Sprint now Sprint refers
to an iteration a Time boxed iteration
which will have a specific deliv
deliverables to be accomplished as part
of it so self organizing team takes that
specific working piece what needs to be
delivered so that is a Sprint backlog we
call it as so from the product backlog
the features functionalities which needs
to be delivered as part of this specific
iteration called Sprint time box
iteration and those Sprint backlog items
are delivered the output of the Sprint
would be the features what is been taken
the working piece working product so to
demonstrate ownership and transparency
for work assigned to them so they own it
the entire thing assigned to them there
is there should be ownership so ensuring
the success of daily scrum meeting by
providing crisp and correct information
so scrum has one uh event there are five
events basically so one of the events
which happens daily is daily scrum
meeting where the team comes up with
scrum master so they would speak about
what is that they have accomplished uh
from the previous stand up to till now
is there anything which is stopping them
to move forward so giving the crisp
updates specific summary updates so that
scrum Master understands the status so
any
specific changes or any specific support
which are required scrum Master would
discuss separately with those
individuals and get it done so it should
be minimum 15 minutes meeting when we
say daily standup meeting so scrum team
collaborate with each of the team
members they work together and the s
self organized so next question the
differentiate between ail and scrum now
it is very essential to understand the
terminologies differences so if we just
end up with looking at wrong
understanding of each of the
terminologies then explaining will
become difficult so what does it mean by
agile and what it is when it comes to
the terminology called scrum the term
agile refers to ability to move quickly
and easily by becoming more flexible and
adaptable this is what the meaning which
gets associated with the term agile so
many times I have seen people answering
agile is a methodology agile is a
iterative and increment methodology and
also I think when you search through the
popular search engines you may come
across that which is wrong so agile is
the terminology which is used to state
to move quickly and easily by becoming
more flexible and adaptable this we
should keep in mind so if the question
may be like what are agile
methodologies then you can come across
like one of the agile methodologies is
Scrum and you can go on on various
different methodologies what we have so
scrum is an agile
methodology right the term scrum is the
name given to the agile meth methodology
which enables organization to become
agile right so to become agile obviously
there are various methodologies scrum is
very popular so that is the main
difference so further if you look at
agile Manifesto on 12 principles which
acts as guidelines to become agile so
there is something called agile
Manifesto Four Points clearly
articulates what needs to be focused on
to become agile and that support that is
supported through the 12 principles
which guides so scrum is used in
projects where requirements are
constantly changing means I want to
become AEL so I adopt scrum so this
definitely has to align to Agile
Manifesto and take the guidelines
whatever is mentioned in 12 principles
of agile Manifesto then looking at
leadership perspective rol perspective
so Manifesto mentions the required
collaboration interactions to become
agile whereas scrum defines the roles
like the scrum Master the product owner
the self-organizing teams which is cross
functional self-organizing team so these
are the main three roles which scrum
defines now generally when we say
projects we come across the role like
project manager so do we see such
project managers in scrum answer is no
because the scrum master who engages
with team
regularly more than management they
focus on doing facilitating role to the
scrum teams so that things can be
delivered the way it is required and
more flexibility is given to the team to
take the calls to accomplish the results
so scrum Master facilitates whereas the
product owner as I mentioned earlier
looks at the product backlog and
prioritizes and provides what are the
features functionalities needs to be
created in the next iterations So
speaking about flexibility definitely
agile manifestor mentions the required
focus on working software and focusing
on changes so that that's the focus
Direction what it provides so scrum
approaches enables teams to react to
changes quickly the scrum methodology is
made such a way the team understanding
that can able to react and those changes
and modifications are made visible to
the team so delivery perspective
Manifesto provides necessary guidelines
on frequent delivery of product or
software so scrum with time boxed
iterations called Sprints builds
delivers to the users regularly and
upheld agile principles that is very
important so delivery here is as per the
users requirement as per the customer
requirements because customer when we
want to become a child customer has to
involve very closely stakeholder has to
collaborate without that you cannot
become
aile so next point is about
collaboration aile Manifesto stresses on
individual interactions and customer
collaborations So based on this if you
look at in the scrum how are they
demonstrating this so there are various
events which happens in scrum so as I
mentioned earlier we have daily standup
meetings and other scrum events like
Sprint retrospective Sprint reviews
daily standup meetings which happens
like Sprint planning which happens
regularly so it it becomes a reason for
collaboration and everyone to discuss
and take the call
so question number five what are the
main artifacts of this Crum process Now
product backlog so which consists of
list of new features changes which are
uh looking organization is looking for
uh to bring into the existing features
changes to the existing features bug
fixes changes to the infrastructure and
several other activities to ensure a
particular outcome so product backlog so
then we can speak about Sprint backlog a
subset of product backlog so the Sprint
backlog contains task that the team aims
to complete to satisfy the Sprint's
goals so set of product backlog things
are taken put into Sprint backlog and
those are the features which are
supposed to be produced as a result as
part of that particular Sprint the team
first identifies tasks from the product
backlog that need to be delivered to
achieve a goal so these tasks are then
added to the Sprint backlog so the team
first identifies tasks from product
backlog
as per the priorities the list which is
prioritized in the product backlog that
is taken put into Sprint backlog and
then those are delivered so next you can
think about product increment the
product increment is the combination of
all product backlog tasks completed in
the Sprint and the value of the
increments of previous Sprints the
outcome should be in the usable
condition even if the product owner
doesn't decide to release it it is very
important each of of the increments
which comes out so needs to fulfill this
now question number six how are the
product and Sprint backlog different
from one another product backlog versus
Sprint backlog let us see a few
differences so product backlog is the
list of items that needs to be completed
for developing the product which is the
list of all the features functionality
Consolidated one whereas Sprint backlog
is a list of items to be completed
during each Sprint which are taken from
product back backlog the backlog when it
comes to product backlog the backlog is
collected from the customer by product
owner and assigned to the team whereas
in Sprint backlog the teams collects the
backlog from the product owner and sets
up the time frame for the
Sprint so product backlog is specific to
end goal ultimate objective whereas
Sprint backlog is specific to that
Sprint specific iteration called Sprint
in scrum what is that we're going to
produce as part of
it product backlog is based on customer
Vision whereas print backlog will vary
based on the product Vision defined by
product owner so priortize list you take
from there product backlog so product
backlog is independent of Sprint backlog
whereas Sprint backlog is dependent on
product backlog reason you we know
already I explained so this this this
the prioritized list of backlogs we take
from product backlog and create this uh
specific product as part of Sprint which
become Sprint
backlog so product backlog refers to
until the project is complete the
product owner maintains the product
backlog for a Sprint backlog when it
comes to Sprint backlog each new Sprints
as backlogs added by the team as each
prints are initiated so next question
who is the scrum master and what does he
or she do so a scrum Master promotes and
supports the adoption of scrum in the
team scrum Master helps everyone to
understand the theory practices rules
and values in the scrum so scrum Master
is playing the role of facilitation
enablement right so scrum Master ensures
the team follows scrum values principles
and
practices removes blockages that may
hamper the progress of the
project protects the team from being
distracted ensuring the team delivers
value during every Sprint so next
question what happens in Daily standup
sessions so daily standup sessions are
the discussion which are done daily that
takes place under usually 15 minutes in
duration the objective is to understand
what went well what tasks are completed
from the last standup session what tasks
are pending and the obstacles the team
was facing if at all any uh specific
task is not accomplished for certain
reasons so what are stopping them
stopping the team to accomplish that
that needs to be made visible so that
separate meeting can be held to discuss
on that and do the necessary Corrections
by taking proper
actions so the objective of this daily
standup meeting is to understand the
overall scope and status of the project
further individual discussion can be
taken up after the daily standup
sessions as I mentioned earlier if at
all if you find something is not
accomplished as per the plan now how do
we ensure that is corrected and why is
it happening is there anything any
support is required by the team to focus
on that so something like that can be
checked on question number nine what is
Scrum ban so scrum ban is a development
methodology that is a combination of
scrum and kban so this can be used to
meet the needs of the team that aims to
minimize the batching of work and to
adopt a pool based system so kban is
called as pull BAS system so which
actually helps in terms of visualizing
what work is in progress and since it is
a visualize visualized system it is
visible to everyone so it works uh in
terms of making people become conscious
to take that work and get it closed
quickly so it's also called pull system
because work is pulled from that
particular list so and this Conan
approach or methodology or thought is
applied in scrum we call it as scrum B
so combination of this definitely helps
in terms of making that entire Journey
successful and supports the scrum
methodology so scrum B includes the
structure of scrum along with the
flexibility and visualization of Canan
so scrum B is used by the teams that
need to be structure of scrum that has
the structure of scrum and the
flexibility of a flow-based
method like
Anan so question number 10 what is
Sprint zero and Spike so the term Sprint
zero refers to the short amount of
effort put for creation of vision a
rough skeleton of the product backlog so
now we do this whenever we need to
understand certain things how things
looks like to get certain insights so
this also includes Insight towards
estimating the release of products so
you get some Vision it get some clarity
right so this Sprint zero are required
to create project skeleton alongside
research spikes keeping minimal design
develop a small number of stories
completely have low velocity and be
light weight so speaking about the spike
so spike is set of activities used in
extreme programming I think uh this was
introduced there in extreme Pro
programming that is one of the agel
methodologies so involving research
design investigation making proof of
Concepts Etc so the objective of spike
is to reduce the risk of technical
approach by gaining knowledge which
helps understanding requirements and to
improve reliability so more aware we are
more clarity we have I think putting
step further will become easier so
informed decisions you can take so next
question what is Scrum of
scrums now scrum of scrums is a
terminology used for scaled agile
techniques which is required to control
and collaborate with multiple scrum
teams so when will we come across
the need for collaborating between
multiple scrum teams so these are the
scenarios where organization as a
complex structure complex in nature
where you may require to handle
them together all of them uh together
for accomplishing the common objective
for business various scrum teams you
would have so scrum of scrum helps in
terms of better collaboration and handle
them easily or better way better control
it is
used in the situations where teams are
working together on complex assignments
just visualizing the system various
different deliverables which are not a
simple deliverables which we can do with
a simple scrum team instead we have
various different deliverables which
needs to be made and Dynamics are too
complex so bigger projects then scrum of
scrum approaches can be taken so scaling
the agile methodology to that level so
it is used to establish the required
transparency collaboration adaption
adoption to the required scale to ensure
the products can be developed and
delivered so whatever the products are
delivered whatever we consider to be
delivered so those needs to focus on the
business objectives which is very
essential so what is user story
mapping so user story mapping represents
and arranges user stories that help with
understanding the systems
functionalities the systems backlog
planning releases and providing value to
the customers so first of all we write
user stories to understand the required
features functionality in the user
perspective now if you map those user
stories which user story linked to other
user story which functionality links to
other functionality determining that
will become
easier so now user story Maps arranges
user story based on the priority along
the horizontal axis on the vertical axis
they're represented based on increasing
level of
sophistications so this will help in
terms of handling in a regular flow in a
specific flow not regular flow specific
flow so that things can be done in order
with full clarity so question number 13
what happens in Sprint
retrospective so after the Sprint review
so Sprint completes so Sprint review
happens the Sprint retrospective is done
so so during this meeting the Lessons
Learned what went well what mistakes we
did what were the issues so is there any
new way of doing things so all these are
discussed so that these necessary
Corrections can be considered in the
upcoming iterations the Sprints so data
from year is incorporated when planning
the new Sprint so the learning what you
had you're going to collect it what went
well what went wrong What was supposed
to be the best approach and how did we
approach it is there any other way of
doing it so these are discussed and very
essential to do it at the end of
completion of each of the Sprints
review question number 14 what is
empirical process control in
scrum so empiricism refers to work based
on facts experiences evidences
observations and
experimentation so empirical process
control is established and followed
scrum ensuring project progress and
project interpretation is based on facts
of observation so actual facts and
figure is very important any decisions
what we make any uh progression what we
make should be always based on on ground
facts and actual pictures we should not
deviate from it so these rely on
transparency observation adaption
obviously when you're working on the
data on ground reality so you're working
on the actual one it is transparent it
is on the observe data the mindset of
the team and the shift required in
thought process and culture are very
essential to accomplish the agility
required by
organization so mindset of the team is
very
essential and Adoption of process
compliance to the process the culture
the behavior obviously plays a very
important role when you do something
within the organization so that needs to
be done as per the need which should
complement to the business
objectives very important and that
should be based on facts not on some
thoughts or assumptions or ideas so next
questions what are some drawbacks of
using scrum so scrum requires
individuals who have
experience without whom the project
risks will have a risk of failure so one
does not have a
capability difficult scrum request team
to be collaborative and committed so
people collaborating individuals
collaborating itself is a big challenge
in many organizations so bringing this
into the place is very important when
you want to adopt scrum so scrum
requires teams to be collaborative and
committed to ensure the required results
they should work together and also they
should collaborate with customers
stakeholders the less experienced scrum
Master can cause the failure of the
project so be careful scrum Master is
the one who is facilitator we should
understand this who enable the scrum
teams who ensure scrum teams gos the way
we need them to work if scrum Master
doesn't understand this Dynamics does
not have the clarity on this obviously
the he or she can not enable to team to
become that if tasks are not well
defined the project can have any
inaccuracies scrum works better for
smaller projects and would be difficult
to scale to large complex projects
that's where we were discussing on few
questions before this scrum of scrum we
discussing about when it becomes a
complex project which those needs to be
handled together which will become
complex so next questions what are the
skills of a scrum master so a strong
understanding of scrum and AEL concept
scrum Master should have fine-tuned
organizational skills so when scrum
Master is working with self-organizing
team with various different capabilities
so unless the organization skills
interpersonal skills if scrum Master
does not have working with them will
become difficult so scum Master should
be familiar with technology that the
team uses basic understanding of that
how it works the Dynamics associated
with that and scrum Master should have
an ability to coach and teach the team
to follow scrum and its methodologies
and very clear about the terminologies
artifacts and all the events what
happens so scrum Master should have an
ability to handle conflicts and resolve
them quickly so conflict is a scenario
Ario which would happen for various
different reason however when conflict
occurs the scrum Master should not shy
away from it own it to resolve in the
interest of the project whatever is
being done it is very important scrum
master has to be a servant leader so it
is not like I'm a specific manager or
leader of certain kind and I'm doing
this with certain way no I'm actually
facilitating I am guiding I'm showing
certain direction
to the organization so that so to the
team when I say organization I'm
speaking about scrum team so that they
are enable to take up the specific
project and accomplish the results
accordingly question number 17 how can
Discord be dealt within the scrum team
now the root cause of the issue need to
be identified and addressed complete
ownership needs to be established when
you deal with this and try to diffuse
the disagreement
so emphasizing on the focus area that
complements the project so here when we
take up any of the discussions any of
the opportunities or any actions what we
take everything should be revolving
around objective of ultimate objective
of whatever we are doing so when we need
to resolve something when we get into
the root causes always it helps to look
at the actions in terms of eliminating
those causes so once the causes are
eliminated it is quite obvious you can
able to deal with it and address it with
easily with the right set of actions so
emphasize on Focus areas that
complements the project in the sense
that should be the ultimate Direction
not my individual interest not that
individual interest I favor this person
I favor that person that should not be
the case so favoring this solution or
favoring that solution I'm okay with
this particular technology I'm very
happy with this technology not such
thoughts it is the direction what is set
I should move things in that direction
so to establish a common understanding
and to guide the team to the
Direction performing continuous
monitoring and providing complete
visibility very very important so next
question what is a user story so user
stories are an agile software
development project management tools it
provides the team with simple natural
language explanations of one or more
features written from the end users
perspective now for example I'm a
account holder in a
bank so what is the facility a bank
would give you to um account holders
there is ATM banking there is net
banking there is Mobile Banking and
there is over the
counter now when bank is working on
creating certain specific features or
specific mobile app to the account
holders now what are the things user
needs that needs to be visualized now if
I say the role here is account holder as
a account holder I want to download the
statements of every
month as a account holder I want to
download the statements every month this
is what my requirement is how will you
facilitate this this will provide the
Insight
towards
how the bank what are the features and
functionalities and how this
requirements can be fulfilled by the
bank and what features functionality the
particular mobile app should have so
that account holder can download the
statements so user storage will provide
that insights what every users so
account holder is not just an user here
there are many users when it comes to
mobile app of a bank we have people who
monitor it manage it who develop it so
they need to have a Clarity on what
exactly they need and that needs to be
written as part of user story that what
features functionality can be easily
determined mind out of
it so a user story does not go into
detail it just mentions as I gave an
example it just mentions how a certain
type of work will bring value to the end
user the end user in this case could be
an external end users or even internal
customers or colleagues within the
organization so if I'm an organization I
produce an HR application I create an HR
application uh for claim processing
which I don't have till today so that is
for internal users in the bank example
I'm speaking about external
customers so user stories also form the
building blocks of agile framework like
epics and
initiatives these help ensure that the
team work to the goals of the
organization through epics and
initiatives so further the requirements
for making the user stories a reality
are added later after discussing with
the team so to write a user story The
involvement of the team members are very
essential they should discuss and come
out and agree yes this is the features
functionality which should be there user
stories are recorded on post it notes
index cards or project management
software whatever is feasible and
whatever is available there next
question how are the user stories epics
and tasks different so user storage
provides the team with simple
explanation of business requirements
created from the inducer perspective as
we saw the few examples in the previous
questions epics are the collection of
related us stories they're usually large
and complex so these epics are created
with specific objectives in mind and
user stories are grouped so that will
form an epic whereas task refers to the
one which are used to track work so they
are used to further broken down from the
user stories so there's a smallest unit
in the scrum used to track work a person
or a team or two people usually work on
the tasks so these tasks or these
through this task I think the features
functionality what are required to be
accomplished are done so question number
20 what is Sprint now as I mentioned
earlier in the question number four so
Sprint is the terminology used in the
scrum I think we explained various
different concepts as we went through so
Sprint is the terminology used in scrum
which refers to time box iterations so
we understood what is this iterations in
scrum approaches when we are going
through that the creation of specific
module or feature which is part of a
product is done during the Sprint the
duration of Sprint varies between a week
or two so means it's a short duration
simple few features functionalities are
taken and created so what is
velocity so velocity is a metric used in
scrum that is a measurement of the
amount of work that is completed by team
during the Sprint so this is helped to
measure how how things are moving how
faster they are moving it refers to the
number of user stories complete in
single Sprint so this speaks about that
speed so or velocity velocity uh how
faster we are going how slower we are
going this helps to vary the variations
we can do in that velocity uh depending
on what business need so what are the
responsibilities of a product
owner so product owner Define the vision
of the
project they anticipate the
needs of the customer and to create
appropriate user stories so they don't
rate user stories as said
they definitely have a set of people who
should get involved the team to write
the user stories lot of discussion has
to happen brainstorming has to happen to
write user stories but product owner is
accountable so product owner has to
evaluate the progress of the Project
based on this backlog what project
product owner has and has to be liened
for all product related questions the
team may have certain questions Sprints
as the Sprint progresses the scrum team
may have certain questions clarification
relating to the user stories those needs
to be
clarified what is burn up and burn down
charts so generally when we say chart it
is a graphical representation so burnup
chart is a tool that is used to track
the amount of work that has been
completed so it is a bar chart the
amount of work completed the height of
the bars keeps increasing in burnup
chart based on what is
completed which will show the total
amount of work the need to be done for a
Sprint or a project so it is it is a bar
chart where each of the bars keeps
increasing in its height as number of
things get delivered
increases so burn down charts typically
again a graphical representation a bar
chart so what is pending to be delivered
it shows that now initially you'll have
a bigger bar and as the project
progresses the height of the bars
reduces indicating what is that is
pending for deliver it is a
representation of how fast the team is
working through the user stories it
helps you to understand that so it shows
total effort against the amount of work
for each
iterations which is helpful for you to
see to that what is spending to complete
question 24 how is estimation in the
scrum project done so the estimation of
user stories is done based on its
difficulty a particular scale in which
which is used to assess the difficulty
of user stories so you have to analyze
how difficult or easy is this some of
the scales which are used like numeric
sizing 1 to 10 t-shirt sizing like s ml
XL fibos series or dog breeds based on
their value so many such approaches are
taken what are some risks in scrum and
how are they handled so first of all we
should know what is risk so some types
of risk in scrum are related to buet
people
Sprint product knowledge and
capability now when we say budget risk
of uh increase exceeding that allocated
budget taking more looking for more
variations I estimated forx it is going
like X Plus Delta X so can we control it
you need to look at that so you need to
assess that risk and what possibilities
the cost can escalate people related
like team members need to be of
appropriate skills and capabilities if
they lack that obviously uh difficult
it's not about just skills and
capabilities the culture the behavior
the attitude the energy the Synergy that
collaboration what people will have then
Sprint related in terms of duration and
deliverables exceeding the duration
addition of scope to that Sprint in
between so that challenges that
difficulties so product referring to
user stories and epics having ill
defined user stories and apex not
properly articulated there is no proper
visualization when you look at that user
story not understanding so no nobody's
explaining it
correctly so then U knowledge and
capabilities so it is not just related
to the people here it's a entire system
everyone was who is involved with the
specific resource with its capability it
can be technology capabilities also so
when I say risk it basically involves
identification assessment analysis and
defining risk response plans and
implementing them now when I say assess
assessing the risks should be
qualitative as well as
quantitative so depending on the impact
and probability of a risk if it is a
high impact risk obviously re to do both
qualitative and quantitative if a simple
one with a very less impact you can take
the call accordingly to what extent you
may require to analyze and have the
response plans for it so once you have
implemented and defined and implemented
the response plans quite obvious you
should keep monitoring it and manage the
risks the risk impacts and probabilities
may vary as the project progresses so we
may require to keep assessing the
identified risk and keep identifying the
new risks as you as we progress in the
project so these are done on a continual
basis right from starting of the project
till completion the reason I told it is
essential to understand that the impact
of the risk is based on the proximity of
actual occurrence of the risk now for
example if you start uh working on
something nothing is delivered at the at
the moment now if specific risk of PE
not people not available or customer is
not involved initial stage very initial
stage so risk impact is accordingly
project would delay in entirety or
requirements not very clear it is
delaying something of that sort of
impact you will have now as the project
progresses almost like 50% of the
project complete now the there is some
uh challenges or risk associated with
issues are occurring related to
customers involvement now your mid of
project so again you will have different
kind of impact 50% is delivered now you
need to progress because active
involvement of stakeholders including
customer is very important when you are
becoming a child so when that is not
happening as an example I'm taking the
involvement of customers the
collaboration part of it that is not
happening now here the impact level is
not equal to the impact level when you
when this happens in the starting of the
project same type of risk what we are
assessing so that is the reason each of
the risks you should keep
assessing the identified one keep
assessing as the project progresses and
check on is there new risk is introduced
as the project is
progressing so next question what are
some popular tools used in scrum so
these are the list so we can think of
Gab Zoho Trello J software yic where is
version one so now what I'm saying is
these are the tools technology tools so
when we say tools we cannot just limit
our thought to technology tools so what
exactly this tool does what are the
techniques used that we need to be very
clear right the metrics what is measured
and methodology of measuring it and what
processes are used what steps are used
so what needs to be used so unless we
are clear relating to specific type of
project usage of these tools may not
make any sense you cannot even implement
or customize this for the requirement
what you are trying to accomplish so you
be clear about it when you're selecting
the tool so 27 how does scrum Master
track Sprint
progress so we have various different
events which happens in uh scrum like
daily scrum meetings SC scrum
retrospective scrum planning scrum
review and checking on the defects which
are escaped density of the
defects burn down uh Sprint burn down
velocity so so checking all of this uh
provides the better insight to scrum
master so that tracking the progress of
the Sprint will become
easier so how to deal with the scope
creep now before we understand the
dealing with scope creep we need to
understand what is scope creep so the
term scope creep refers to the change
which is uncontrolled and added without
checking the impact on the constraints
like scope time cost now what happens is
you will be uh doing certain or
delivering certain
features now you are forced or you are
influenced or without your knowledge
some additional things are put in place
so which may impact later it may add
value it may not add value later doesn't
matter but it may lead in terms of uh
impact your cost time and uh schedules
which is
unexplained and uh that extra effort
what you have put in extra cost what you
have put in uh will become like uh not
recognized by customers and you will not
get anything paid for it so scope to
avoid the scope creep to deal with it
one has to ensure close monitoring of
Works being done on day-to-day basis
because scope crep can happen through
team members influencing team members
are influenced by consumer because of
that it may happen so understanding
communicating the vision to the team for
ensuring the alignment so that team is
very sensitive about that changes what
is happening then capturing reviewing
the project requirements regularly
against what is delivered to emphasize
to the team and customer about the
requirement signed off so that someone
will not come
and uh influence you or uh make that
additional things to be delivered they
need not push you right ensuring any
change introduced to go through change
control so no changes without any proper
approval by the authorities so that only
those what is required to be implemented
is implemented and that is done formally
through the formal change request so
avoiding gold plating so it is B
different thought process when we say
gold plating so we are doing the
projects are trying to add certain
things into the scope to please the
customer as an example doing something
additional providing some additional
features and functionality for which we
are not paid so scrope creep is not a
terminology used for it but gold plating
is the term used but however since it is
an additional scoping so we just added
here so don't say that when the moment
scope creep we says that is not gold
plating gold plating is a different
direction so just to explain you along
with scope creep what else would happen
to where the addition additional
deliverables would come in which is gold
plating so question 29 what is MVP and
MMP which means minimum viable product
and minimal marketing product so now
minimum viable product is a concept of
Lean Startup which stresses upon the
impact of learning while performing
product development so this allows one
to test and understand the idea by
getting exposed to the initial version
of the product for Target customers and
users so to accomplish this one has to
collect all the required relevant data
and learn from the collected data so the
thought behind MVP is to produce a
product to provide access to the users
and to observe how the product is used
perceived and understood this will also
provide more insight towards what the
customers or users needs
are so when it comes to minimal
marketable product this refers to the
description of of the product which will
have a minimal number of features that
addresses the requirements of the users
MMP would help also the organization
reduce the time to Market because you
have the clarity what is that we may
require to provide now question number
30 what does DOD means definition of
done right so DOD refers to the
collection of deliverables which
includes written codes comments on
coding unit tests integration testing
design documents release notes Etc this
would add variable and demonstratable
values to the project development so D
is very helpful to scrum while
identifying the deliverables to achieve
the objectives of project for the stated
reason Above So defining the steps
required to deliver the iterations the
usage of appropriate tool like burndown
to make the process more effective
ensuring on time feedback throughout the
Project Life Cycle ensuring the walkth
through of the product backlog items are
done and understood correctly so then
creation of checklist for product
backlog item ensuring the dood is
defined to become task oriented
involving the product owner for
reviewing during the Sprint and Sprint
retrospective that is about DOD the next
question how can a scrum Master be a
servant leader so very important thing
to understand so what is the meaning of
the servant leader the term servant
leader mainly stresses on service
orientation which a leader should
demonstrate so today we say every
organization is service organization
even an organization who is producing
card if there is no service
orientation they cannot sell so more
stresses on being service orientation
the scrum Master needs to be facilitator
a guide a mentor
Etc this helps the team have increased
involvement and empowerment so now
question number 32 how can one
coordinate between multiple teams
so one of the most common approaches for
this is Scrum of scrums meeting so where
members representing each scrum team
discusses the progress performance
issues risk Etc together this is complex
structure what you're speaking
about the frequency of these meetings
must be predefined well articulated well
defined generalist scrum Master would
represent the particular scrum team on
behalf of that scrum team they would go
and represent the meeting representing
the meeting
besides having a chief scrum
Master whose responsible is coordination
and collaboration among all scrums who
facilitates these meetings so thank you

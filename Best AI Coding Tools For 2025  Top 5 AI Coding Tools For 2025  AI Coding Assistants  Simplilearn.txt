by 2025 if you're not using AI to code
you might be falling behind that might
sound extreme but the truth is AI is
changing how we develop software at
lightning speed whether you are a
beginner or an experienced programmer AI
tools are opening up new opportunities
you might not have thought possible in
this video I will show you the top AI
coding tools that will make you feel
like you have got a full team of
Developers at your disposal no matter if
you're working on web apps mobile
projects or data science AI coding
assistant can seriously boost your
productivity before we get into the list
let me quickly explain what AI coding
tools actually are these tools use
Advanced machine learning to enhance
your coding experience they can suggest
smart code completion generate full code
Snippets and handle repetive task for
you think of them as a helpful assistant
always there to make coding faster and
easier so now let's check out the best
AI code tools used in 2025 before
jumping to the demo part here is a quick
info for you dive into the future of AI
with a generative Ai and machine
learning course in collaboration with en
ICT Academy I bti learn tools like CH
open AI hugging face Python and more
join master classes led by iitg faculty
engage in Hands-On project and earn
executive alumni status this generative
Ai and machine learning course enriches
your career Journey with comprehensive
coverage of machine learning deep
learning NLP generative
reinforcement learning computer vision
and more combining Theory with Hands-On
practice it offers live virtual session
project with integrative labs and master
classes by IIT goart faculty so find the
coing from the description box below and
the pinc so welcome to the demo part of
best AI coding tools for 2025 so in this
I will show you top five coding AI tools
right first we will start with Chad gbt
so I'm not talking about the simple one
because simple one is everyone know but
recently chat GPT launched GPT 40 with
canvas so we will open this here I will
write give me login page code using stml
CSS and CSS
okay see the
magic see like this so right now it's in
beta version okay so I guess uh
those who have paid version so they can
you know use this so now see here what
if I want to change this uh background
color only particular background color I
don't want to change all the code but I
just want to change this this color H2
color or you can say display it will
block or something else okay I want to
change the padding of this particular
you know class
right so here what I will do I will
select this and when popup will come ask
jity so now you can just here you can
write please
change
background color to Blue I don't know
which color is that but again I want to
change it to Blue see it will change
only the background color see rest will
be the same right right see here edited
so this is the best upgrade I can see
with chb with coding for coding okay so
let's see uh one more okay so here what
I will do let's change the padding okay
here I will write
increase what is this border radius
border radius
okay see here is it it will
increase see it did 16 and the rest all
is same so this is one tool okay charity
4 4 with canvas the second is Gemini
okay I'm not going to use Gemini into
Gemini prom but I will open one thing
Google collab okay so here is Google
collab and I will open new notebook so
here you will get jini inbuilt here you
can see gini in buil But first you have
to log in see start coding or generate
with AI if I click on generate with AI
so it will ask me like this so I will
write give me code to find odd and even
n c
Plus+ okay you can write anything so I
will write enter see it's generating and
code is here in minute of
seconds okay if I will write in Java the
code is here in minute of seconds okay
in seconds it will good give you so this
is the second you can use yini as well
and the see while giving prompt here or
you can open Gemini
right you can open Gemini as well but
it's better if you are using Gemini for
code so use in Google collab why because
you can use or you can run code directly
okay let's try to run it let me run
it see it's running wait okay some error
is there inv valid syntax
why okay okay why it's giving error
because I opened this
no
not okay this is the python
notebook right that's why it's giving
error okay let me run this in
Python oh my
God see it's running nicely in Python
because it's python notebook okay so
these are the odd numbers and these are
the even numbers and numbers are already
given here right so this is the second
one and the third one is
cloud okay okay I have to log in it
first so here so in CLA as well we have
you know many models you can say CLA 3.5
Sonet and Hau is there and some more
things are there okay and here I will
write
okay please give me code to make snake
snake game in Python
okay so see now it's
generating so some tools are you know to
generate code from the scratch and some
tools are the you know suggestions tools
okay we will see the next one the
suggestion tool what I'm talking about
okay so here all the details for this
particular code and yeah so third model
is CLA this is how you can use clot so
there are many
models of CLA like I told you already
3.5 Sonet is there Hau is there and
there is one more okay where I can't see
okay but again it's you know sped uh
thing okay and the next is codium okay
so I will show you codium this is the
codium right this codium is this I have
already installed this codium into my
you know vs code okay see codium
generate control+ I see this is the
command just write uh no this is again
python one okay give me code to find the
prime
numbers in
Python okay just
submit and code will be
here see okay code will be here
or if you write here find
the prime
numbers see it will give you suggestion
okay if I will write def
no different
Prime
and then see again suggestion if I will
write this again suggestion then yeah
code is
complete
okay so it will give you suggestions as
well okay this is a codium so just like
codium so this is our four tool codium
and just like codium there is one
amazing tool which is called AWS
Q developer Amazon Q developer this the
amazing tool okay so recently they you
know jumped into this thing AI thing AI
coding and you can install it to visual
code directly as well okay you can go
here and from where the extensions are
there you can write Amazon Q here okay
this thing can install okay it's like
this uh codium only you know let me show
you some
videos what are the videos okay how
codium
works
okay not here I will show you in this
see this is how codium works again same
thing you know see if you'll write this
again the suggestions will come
okay Lambda function to publish user
like codium okay so the fifth one is our
Amazon Q okay so there are many models
like you know co-pilot my this GitHub
co-pilot is
there copilot is
there GitHub copilot is there for this
you know AI
coding air developer tool and if you are
curious to make website with with in a
second so there is one
more app called not app uh this tool you
can say web okay see what you like to
create today I will write here Amazon
but okay let me first yeah so but they
use Sonet 3.5 means CLA they're using
CLA so I will write here I want to
create
amazon.in see it will create website for
you no coding nothing all directly it
will give you website okay it's loading
I guess so this is how you can use
website right see OnePlus node this this
this
G okay I just gave amazon.in and the
website is here within a second okay so
these are some you know important tools
to learn or how to use that them in 2025
for 2025 using AI tools for coding is
essential to be in the race okay so
these are some coding with this we have

transforming the way employees work by
making it simple for individuals to
automate operations blueprism helps
enterprises improve operational
efficiency and agility
hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will see a
tutorial on blue prism let's look at
today's agenda firstly we shall begin
with the introduction to blue prism and
then see the user interface of blue
prism
followed by which we will understand the
core components of blue prism like
process studio object studio application
modeler and others
finally we will have a hands-on session
watch the video till the end to not miss
the hands-on session
if you haven't watched our previous
video on what is blue prism i would
suggest you to go through it for better
understanding
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started with tutorial on
blueprism
introduction to blueprism
blueprism is software that develops
enterprise robotic process automation
allowing businesses to automate complex
end-to-end operations
blueprism developed the virtual
workforce platform concept and works on
an enterprise robotic process automation
platform that is strong highly scalable
secure and reliable
blueprism software complements standard
it solutions by utilizing an agile
virtual workforce that follows
rule-based business processes and
interacts with the system in the same
way that users do
blueprism's rpa software solution
automates tasks that would otherwise be
carried out manually by humans or
through major customization of current
i.t systems resulting in higher level of
automation with significantly lesser
investment and faster deployment
blue prism user interface
there are six types of taps in blue
prism that is home studio control
analytics releases and system
the home page includes many charts that
provide information on the blueprism
database
the workforce availability metric
displays the runtime resources that we
are utilizing
the amount of queues and automation in
the database is shown by total
automation
queue volumes now displays queue volumes
based on the statuses
and largest database table displays the
blueprism database largest tables
studio blueprism studio is a critical
component through which we build actual
automation actions with studio we can
automate a process build a process using
flow add logic calculations and
intelligence without writing any code
drag in actions calculations loops and
more in studio we can connect the blocks
in preferred order use smart skills from
digital exchange
digital exchange is where we can find
ready-made skills to enhance the
automation with machine learning ai
language translation and many more
the studios are divided into two
categories object studio and process
studio control room
control room assigns the process to
digital workers user can quickly start a
process by dragging it on to a resource
the control room is the key
administrative point in blue prism where
we can handle the control monitoring
execution and scheduling of process
executions on dispersed robots
analytics
blueprism analytics is a module that
allows you to see data graphically in
the form of charts such as pi column
gauge and line
releases
the release manager is used to manage
configuration package import and export
between multiple blue prism settings
system
administrators use the system tab to
manage users
let's look at some of the blue prism
components
some of the blue prism components are
process studio object studio
application modular exception handling
and work use
a blue prism process is created as a
diagram that looks much like a common
business flow diagram we can call from
the process studio if the page is
published for development and testing we
use process studio
process studio has only main page
object studio
object studio is mostly used to create
objects we have several type of
activities within the object which are
as follows that is the modular
application to spy the elements
initialize page and cleanup page
the next component is application
modular
the application modeler is used to spy
on apps spying is a process of
identifying the elements in the
applications
we have four different types of spying
modes
that is win32 mode
html mode accessibility mode and region
mode
the next component is exception handling
the managing of exceptions in unattended
automation is defined as exception
handling it ensures that faults can be
automatically fixed if possible or that
they are easily identified and
repairable by system administrators
or they can be forwarded for human
completion if necessary exception
handling success is determined by how
well it is implemented throughout the
development
exception handling is a critical part of
any blue prism solution an exception is
a problem that arises during the
execution of a process
when errors are encountered in blue
prism it generates exceptions
exception handling stages
exception handling can be achieved using
resume recover and exception stage
in the resume stage it ends a block for
handling exceptions in recovery it
begins a block for handling exceptions
in exception stage explicit rises an
exception in the execution of process or
an object
the different types of exception are
internal exception system exception and
business exceptions
internal exceptions come based on our
missing mandatory data in stages
system exceptions will occur based on
internet is down or our robot need
internet or any system failures
business exceptions
these exceptions are not actually
exceptions however based on the business
rules we are creating the exceptions we
need to fire manually through bot
work queues
our queue is a list that may be
configured internally to help a process
manage its workload
a process may use numerous work use and
a work you may be shared by multiple
processes if necessary
the control room queue management tab
serves as the operational user interface
for work use
the tab is divided into two sections
the upper half displays a list of queues
while the lower half displays a list of
queue items
in the configuration of work u work use
are formed in the blue prism's
administrative area system manager
now let us look at a demo on email
automation
if you haven't installed a blue prism
software yet then check out our video on
blue prism installation and get it
installed
so let's jump into blue prism software
and get started with the email
automation
let's first sign in blue prism
click on next this is the overview about
the home page studio and control room
and digital exchange
close it
let's go to studio
the very first step is to import email
pop3 smtp business object to import that
go to file
go to import
process object
and go to browse
you have to go to the folder where blue
prism software is installed in my device
it's installed in c go to local disk c
go to program files
and go to blue prism limited
blue prism automate
here scroll down
and go to vbo business objects
and here you can see
email pop3 smtp
select click on open select this
and click on open
and click on next
click on next
click on next
so when you're done with this the email
pop3 smtp will be imported
the next thing is
create a new process so
select process
go to create new process and let's name
the process
we'll name the process as
email automation
click on next
enter a description of this process if
you want so that if some other user
opens the file he should know that what
is the process about
so enter the description it's optional
so we'll click on finish
and let's open this process now
the very first step is
to drag and drop and action so select
action and drop it here
open this action
so in first step we will set up the
email of pop3 smtp
business object so we'll name it as name
this action as setup
select the business object as email pop3
smtp
and the action
is configure we are configuring it
and here we have to enter the username
password
of the server details
so from where do we get the server
details
to get the server details we have to go
to the browser
go to the browser and
search as
gmail
server configuration
here you see
you will get the
all the details here the port number
the email
so in the smtp server we'll enter the
smtp.gmail.com and the port number as
587 and in the pop3 we will enter pop
gmail.com and port number as 995.
and both the servers will turn it on
to turn it on we'll write it as true
so we'll go back to the
blue prism
so enter the server
pop.gmail.com enter it in the double
quotes
an smtp server
enter as smtp
not gmail.com
and the pop report number is
995
and the smtp port number is
587
and pop use ssl should turn it on to
turn it on we need to enter the value as
true
okay now we should enter the username
and password
if i enter the password here
for example if i enter the password here
the password is visible
we don't want the password to be visible
the password should be encrypted so for
the password to be encrypted in data
item there is an option called
passwording data types
so go to data item
drag and drop a data item
and select the data type as password
and enter the password here here the
password will be encrypted
and click on ok
we'll name the data item as password
similarly we will use another data item
for username
name the data item as name
select the data type as
text
and give the initial value
so
enter your email id
and click on ok
so now we have username and password
now go to the setup
and select the username and password
drag and drop this username
and in the passwords
drag and drop the password
so so the setup is done
the next step is
the next step is we want to enter the
subject and the data in the mail
right for that we need to
use another action item
drag and drop another action
name it as
sending message
select the business object as email pop
sm
tp
and go to action and in the action
select the action as send message
here you need to enter the
email id to whom you want to send so
i'll enter the email id which we had
entered in the username
enter both the from and to email ids so
i'll use the same email id
since this is just for demo i'm using
the same email id so enter the subject
subject i'll enter it as
demo
and enter the body
hello
so now that we have entered the subject
and body
let's close this
and now let us
now use the link
and connect it
now let us click on run and check
whether we have received the email
oops there is an error
we have missed something
oh we have missed a double quoted
let us save again
reset and run
so the process is completed
let us go to the email inbox and check
whether we have received the email
so let me refresh
and here you go
we have received the email
as hello and the
subject is done so we have received the
email now let us send it with an
attachment so for that we go to the blue
prism
we go to sending message here
here you can see attachment
attachment is of the data type
collection
right
so for that we need to use a collection
item so drag and drop a collection
go to collections
and
click on import
select the business object as email
and select the action as
send message
and the parameter with attachments
select the attachment and click on ok
next go to initial value in initial
value click on add
you can add multiple path here
and attach how many other attachments
you want
for now we'll attach only one attachment
so you need to provide the file path
here
so we'll go to the desktop
so i have this article on desktop so
i'll attach this article in the email
so
select this article
shift and right click
and
copy as path copy this path go back to
blue prism
and provide the path here
remove the double quotes
and click on ok
so once the collection item is completed
go back to sending message
go to collections
here in the collection
select this
and click on ok
click on reset
and let us run
and here you go you can see the process
is completed
so let us go to the email inbox and
check if we have received an email with
an attachment
so here we go
we have received the email with the
attachment
let us open it
the same email with the subject demo
and the body as hello and with the
article which i had attached rpa
projects
so i have received the
attachment
so with that we have reached the end of

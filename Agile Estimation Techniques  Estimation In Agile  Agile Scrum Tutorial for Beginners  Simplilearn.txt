hello everyone and Welcome to our video
on agile estimation techniques I am
thrilled to have you join us as we dive
into the dynamic world of Agile
development today's tutorial promises a
straightforward exploration of basic
agile techniques providing you with the
insight to navigate project timelines
effectively get ready for a simplified
Journey Through the essentials of agile
estimation equipping you with the KN how
to confidently navigate the agile
landscape first up we will explore the
basics what is estimation in agile next
we tackle the question why are agile
estimations important moving on we will
Del into the common agile estimation
techniques from story points to planning
perker we will understand the popular
methods used in agile teams and finally
we will wrap it up with the best
practices for agile estimation learn
tips and tricks to optimize your
estimation process but before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our YouTube
channel Channel and hit the Bell icon to
never miss any updates from us so let's
begin by knowing what is estimation in
aile estimation in agile involves
predicting the effort needed to complete
a prioritized task in the product
backlog usually measured in time this
process enables teams to plan Sprints
more accurately leading the better
project management and timely delivery
of value to the customer by estimating
effort required for each task agile
teams can prioritize effectively and
allocate resources efficiently
ultimately enhancing productivity and
ensuring the most important work is
completed within the desired time frames
this iterative approach to estimation
aligns with agile principles allowing
the flexibility and adaptability in
response to changing requirements and
priorities just a quick info for you if

description box next up we have is while
agile estimations are important agile
estimations play a pivotal role in
project management fostering a
collaborative and adaptable approach
here is why agile estimations are
important number one risk management
agile estimations provide a structured
way to identify and manage Risk by
breaking down task into smaller
manageable units teams can access
potential challenges early on allowing
for Tim Li mitigation strategies this
proactive risk management ensures that
teams are better equipped equipped to
handle uncertainities and changes in the
project
requirement next is coordination and
planning estimations in AI Aid in
effective coordination and planning by
assigning story points or time estimates
to task team gains a shared
understanding of the workload and
priorities this promotes smoother
collaboration as team members align
their efforts based on common
understanding of Project's timeline next
we have is resource allocation
estimations help in optimizing resource
allocation teams can distribute work
based on the estimated effort required
for each task preventing overloading of
team members and ensuring a balanced
workload this in turn contributes to
maintaining team moral and
productivity following this we have
client communication agile estimations
enhance communication with clients or
stakeholders providing realistic
estimates along for for transparent and
open discussions about project timelines
and expectations this transparency
builds trust and fosters a collaborative
relationship between the development
teams and clients so this was about why
agile estimations are important next up
we have is common agile estimation
techniques in agile estimations teams
use different methods to predict how
long task will take first is three-point
estimate teams use a three-point
estimate
optimistic pessimistic and most likely
to Gorge task duration it's like making
prediction by considering the best worst
and expected scenarios helping teams to
prepare for uncertainities in the
project timelines next we have is dot
voting dot voting is a simple and visual
way for teams to prioritize task team
members vot on task using dots giving a
quick and inclusive way to identify
what's most important to everyone
involved next technique is planning
poker in planning poker team members
assign story points to task through
discussions and
consensus it's like a card game where
each card represents a level of effort
promoting team collaboration and
aligning everyone to the complexity of
each task then there is t-shirt sizes or
estimation units using t-shirt sizes
small medium and large as estimation
units makes it easy to categorize and
compare task complexities it's like
fitting task into different Siz t-shirts
simplifying the process of understanding
and prioritizing work based on its
relative
size next we have is buckets buckets
group similar tasks together based on
complexity it's like sorting marbles
into the bucket by size this simplifies
Planning by focusing on similar task at
once making it easier for teams to
estimate and manage work in a more
organized way so these were some of the
common agile estimation techniques When
selecting an estimation technique it's
essential to consider various factors to
tailor the approach to your team
specific needs factors such as project
complexity team expertise and the level
of detail required should influence your
choice now let's have a look at some of
the best practices for agile estimation
the number one we have is team player
approach
emphasize a team player mentality
ensuring Collective input and shared
responsibility for accurate estimation
regularly review and refine Embrace a
culture of continuous Improvement by
regularly reviewing and refining your
estimation process learn from the past
projects identify areas of enhancement
and adjust your approach accordingly
iterative refinement continuously refine
estimation process based on Project
learnings fostering Improvement over
time concluding our exploration we have
uncovered the basics of agile estimation
what it means and why it's crucial for
project success we have dived into the
Practical techniques like three-point
estimates and planning poker along with
simple tips for better estimation
remember this is just the beginning keep
collaborating refining and enjoy the
journey of making agile projects more
seamless so all right guys with that we

hello and welcome to connect my name is
Erica sweet and I'm a program manager on
the visual C++ team this video will
highlight what's new in Visual Studio
2019 for C++ developers we've worked
hard to build a story of cross-platform
development and ensure that visual
studio supports developers who are
targeting more than just Windows in this
video I will continue to build on this
story and use our new start window
experience to open a cross-platform C
make application that runs on both Linux
and Windows demonstrate our improved
Linux targeting experience and highlight
new features that push the boundaries of
individual and team productivity towards
the end of the video I will invite my
coworker Augustine to join me as we demo
more collaborative features to help make
every C++ developer not just windows
developers more productive when you
launch Visual Studio 2019 you'll be
prompted with a new start window
experience to the left you can still
view your recently open projects and
files and to the right you have four
entry points to viewing your code you
can clone or check out code from an
online code repository open a local
project or solution file open a local
folder which supports any folder
containing C++ code without generating
visual studio project and solution files
or create a new project the new project
dialog has also been simplified so you
can now filter just for C++ templates
filter by target platform or by project
type in this demo I'm going to be
running a cross-platform C make
application called pong that runs on
both Linux and Windows so if I were
starting from scratch I could search for
the C make project template but I
already have saved a copy of the project
locally so I'm going to open it using
the open folder experience Visual Studio
has native support for seat make which
means that you can open any folder with
a C make list text file without ever
generating visual studio project and
solution files Visual Studio 2019 also
supports a C make target C which is a
more seemed eccentric way of viewing
your file structure organized by targets
and allows you to build a single target
at a time run code analysis on one
target or run code analysis on a single
file of a time to name a few options
up here you can manage all of your
configurations for a cross-platform
application so let's first get this
working on Linux if I navigate to the
connection manager using the new search
experience I can manage all of my
connections to remote machines I already
have a SSH connection set up to my local
Linux VM but here I could easily add a
new one all I require for a remote build
is an SSH connection a working C++ tool
chain on the remote machine and if
you're using C m'q than a relatively
recent version of C make also on the
remote machine to build using C make on
any machine you need to pass your
toolchain file as a seam it command-line
argument which we support as a part of
our C make settings JSON file I
generated this using VC package our
cross-platform package management system
I did this because pong has a dependency
on the library SF ml which pulls in
several other dependencies and VC
packaged managed all of this for me so
now that I have set up my remote
configuration and set up my remote build
when I hit run my application will
automatically be launched on my remote
machine so I will hit run and launch my
Linux VM
and when the builds done I will see pong
ah
as a part of the C++ development with
Linux workload we also support
intellisense for headers on remote
connections so here you can see if I
hover over you can see headers being
pulled from Linux connections are
directly from a Linux machine which
enables intellisense exactly as if I
were working on my remote machine so now
let's get things set up for Windows so
I'm going to switch over to my Windows
configuration and make a few edits to
the code so I'll go down here to the
main function and type sleep
here I see these purple squiggles which
is actually platform-specific
intellisense warning me that what I just
typed is undefined for another one of my
configurations so here specifically
windows H and the sleep function are
undefined in my linux configuration
visual studio 2019 also has a new thing
called intelecom for C++ developers and
Teleco trains using numerous real-world
projects on github that have over a
hundred stars to give you the best
possible suggestions for this reason it
gives great suggestions for commonly
used libraries like STL which we will
take a look at now so here you can see
that Visual Studio is giving me unique
suggestions based upon the context of my
if statement even if I were to continue
coding and try to sort my vector
I would be prompted with V begin and
then the end and now if I were to go
back and change this to see begin again
then I would be prompted instead with C
end and this shows shows that my
suggestions are changing based upon the
context of my code and this is about
more than just reducing the number of
keystrokes but is really about helping
developers understand their workflow and
understand oh this API gets called next
or this API gets called from within the
context of an if statement C++
developers can also lever it now
leverage intellisense within class and
function templates so you can see here
within this template that I'm not
getting member lists intellisense
but if I go up here and I specify that
the parameter T should be a player a
type player then the member list prompts
the relevant suggestions like get name
and get score if I hover over P I can
also see that P is a player
so now let's run the program on Windows
so it looks good but actually as I'm
playing the game
I realize that my paddle won't go all
the way down on the left-hand side it
stops a little bit early so I'm going to
try to figure out what's going on but
actually I'm going to call in a
co-worker to help me and we're gonna use
a live share which is a way for me to
instantly share my codebase without him
having to clone a repo or set up his
local environment so I'm gonna start a
live share session by clicking the live
share and generating a link that I will
pass using Skype over to my coworker
August in who's gonna come help me join
this debugging session and diagnose my
code
hi Erica let's see if I can help so
right now I'm actually on a linux
machine and I'm running Visual Studio
code but that's not a problem I went
ahead and I opened your life share link
and now I'm taking a look at taking a
look at your code so it looks like I you
have this file opened up on CPP and it
looks like you're currently debugging
with the cursor pause here at the
beginning of the main function now I
actually have full intellisense in this
codebase because I'm basically getting
the intellisense from your machine so I
can actually run operations like find
all references go to definition and I
don't even have all the tools installed
that you have installed on your machine
I'm just getting all this information
from your machine in this live share
session and that actually applies to
debugging as well so I can actually go
ahead if I would like and actually step
through a few lines of code and it's
running things through the debugger on
your machine and yet I can still control
things from my end so that's actually
pretty cool
but now that I think about it your
problem here is that the paddle doesn't
go all the way down to the bottom of the
screen and since this is a graphical
application we can't really just step
our way through things in order to fix
the problem so actually let's go ahead
and just stop debugging for a second and
I think I remember where roughly the
code for controlling that logic is I'm
gonna go ahead and go to line 140 I
think that's somewhere near there and
okay it looks like we have an if
statement here checking if the game is
currently going on and I also see here
some logics some more if statements
checking if the user is pressing the up
arrow key or the down arrow key now I
know that the problem is happening when
you try to go to the bottom of the
screen so I'll look under the down arrow
key so let's take a look at things here
it looks like this number is really
quite a bit too high I'm gonna go ahead
and lower it to -5 what this is seems to
be doing is that it's preventing the
paddle from getting anywhere near the
edge of the screen so I think if we make
that smaller it should fix the problem
why don't we take a look and see if this
fixes things
yeah it seems to be better thanks August
in glad to help
I hope you have enjoyed this demo and

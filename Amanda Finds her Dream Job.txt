Amanda DeLisi: My name is Amanda DeLisi.
I work for Davidson Macri Sweeping.
My job title is Office Assistant.
Katherine Bournelis: Amanda had worked for
10 years in retail and then her position was
eliminated and she had come to realize what
she wanted to do.
DeLisi: I used to volunteer doing office jobs
since I was 14.
And I really liked it a lot.
Bournelis: We applied for a number of positions
with different organizations.
It took Amanda almost a year to find this
position.
Cathy Albright: As we were introduced to the
program, it sounded like something we wanted
to pursue, so we created a position and we
chose Amanda.
DeLisi: It was kind of hard at first.
We help each other.
I enjoy what I'm doing.
Bournelis: This highlights the impact of the
Supported Employment Program with Microsoft.
Amanda's part of the team.
She loves what she's doing and it's such a
win for everyone.
DeLisi: I wanted to work in an office since
I was young.
This is one of my dream jobs.

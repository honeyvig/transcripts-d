c sharp it is a popular programming
language that may be used for range of
purposes such as mobile application
game development and enterprise software
c-sharp brings up a lot of opportunities
for you as a developer
c-sharp was introduced by microsoft
together with the dot net framework and
visual studio
c-sharp was recognized as an
international standard by ecma in 2002
and by iso in 2003.
and on that note hey everyone i am
rebecca khandelwal and i welcome you all
to yet another and exciting video from
simply learn
in this session we will be discussing
c-sharp interfaces
however before we begin make sure you
have subscribed to our youtube channel
and clicked on the bell icon below so
you never miss an update from simply
learnt's youtube channel
let's look at the agenda for today's
topic
we shall begin a session with an
introduction to interfaces in c sharp
after that we will discuss why do we
need interfaces in c sharp
finally we will conclude this session
with an implementation of c sharp
interfaces
let's get started with what is
interfaces in c sharp
interfaces in c sharp is like a
blueprint of a class
it is like an abstract class because all
the methods which are declared inside
the interface are abstract methods
it cannot have a methods body and cannot
be instantiated
we name an interface with a capital
letter i in the syntax as you can see
here
next
let's discuss why do we need interfaces
in c sharp
since in c shaft we can use inheritance
using classes
so to overcome that issue we use
interfaces
interfaces are basically used to build
loosely coupled application this means
that components are not dependent on
each other and any altercation will not
impact that application itself
let's say for example there are two
classes drawable in shape
now this drawable class is dependent on
shape class since it can only draw
shapes if there are said shape defined
in the class
this dependency is due to them being
tightly coupled
now let's say we have an interface
drawable
now this interface can easily
communicate with different classes and
it will not affect the main goal to draw
the shape
finally let's implement this interface
in c sharp
let's start with using
system
let's start with creating an interface
so public
interface
drawable
we always use capital i in front of the
name
as in common nomenclature
for interface
these interfaces don't have excess
specifier like in classes like
public private or protected so we will
simply define void
a function draw
now we don't define any
methods in the interface itself
so we will now create a class so public
class
rectangle
drawable
now we will call the function draw so
public
void
go
now to draw
we will write console
dot
write line
and we will print
drawing
rectangle
to give the proof that we are accessing
this
drawing function for that from rectangle
now let's write another class circle
so public
class
circle
and we will call public
void draw
and we will print using console
dot
write line
and we will print
drawing
circle
now
let's make another class
public
class
test
now we will declare our main here so
public
static
void
main
now we will declare an object for the
interface
now this object
will use
to create an object for the rectangle
and then we will call draw
d dot row
to access rectangle
now let's define this d
for the circle so d is equals to
new
circle
and then we will again call draw
to draw this circle
now let's save this
and run it
as you can see here
we are able to call rectangle in circle
classes using draw function with the
help of interfaces now let's get back to
our slides and this was all for today's

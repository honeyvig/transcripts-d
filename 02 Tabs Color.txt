I have uh my code base here I got a
bunch of files open but I can't really
see how many how many files do I have
open and you know I don't really know I
can only see what whatever my screen
resolution allows me to see how wide the
screen is and that's why we always have
had this little thing up here you can
click next to the tabs and if you click
that now
notice how you can see the list of open
files there are some that are grayed out
and italics those are the ones that are
not visible right now and then we have
the ones that just look kind of normal
those are the ones you see and the one
in bold is the one that's currently
active sometimes I kind of just want to
see everything all the time so if I go
to the settings icon I can now say show
tabs in multiple rows and what's really
nice here is that if you have the screen
real estate if you have the vertical
space you can now stack all these tabs
so you can see everything that's open
but there are some monitors you know
that are extra wide for instance and in
those it would be kind of nice if we can
take our Taps and instead of having them
on top then move them to the side where
we have more space so again go into
settings and click on Place tabs on the
left it's really nice I can resize this
to whatever I want but let's see what
else we can do here because I have all
these open documents and you can see by
default they are sorted by the project
they belong to and they're all listed
under each of those projects take it one
step further here what if we colorize
these documents per project so now each
tab has the same color if it belongs to
the same project and that makes it even
easier for me to kind of at a glance see
where these files belong if we don't
want it per project because I already
group my task for project here like
instead we could do it by file extension
so that's also very handy so I can see
all my racer files all my c-sharp files
all my JavaScript files we can also go
ahead and say let's do it by regular
expression let's configure the regular
Expressions it's a file here that opens
up and I can start typing and let's say
we want to do
CSS and as soon as I save the file we
can see the CSS file has now got updated
with the color we have Razer and we can
even take it further we can say you know
everything that contains the word you
know category let's say everything that
has the word will be colorized so you
can really customize how you colorize
these tabs and of course if you move
back up and use the tabs on the top they
maintain their colors I kind of like to
do per project when I have the tabs up
top because in this case they're not
grouped by a project and so having them
polarized by project is my preference
yours might be different but I really
enjoy this

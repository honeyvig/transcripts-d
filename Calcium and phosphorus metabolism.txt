hi everyone in the next topic of
discussion for the MDS finish line is
calcium and phosphorus metabolism I'm
dr. society team MDS conquer so this is
actually a very important question in
the physiology being asked the basics
paper so it's almost important for all
the subjects or all the departments so
we'll just have a look so for any essay
question it's always better to write the
content so you can write these contents
and the subheadings also you can write
for calcium as well as for the
phosphorus so if the if you can write
this contents it's good ok and then you
can give introduction of why are the
minerals very important for the body if
to regulate the energy of a body
electrolyte balance and all that you can
just put a slight introduction of a
regarding all the elements all the 25
important essential elements so you can
just put forward and next you can jump
to calcium so calcium you can this write
of how it is being distributed like this
about thousand grams of calcium 99% is
in the bone whereas other 1% is in the
non bone that's to extracellular Li then
in the bloodstream and the interstitial
fluid so you can just put this later you
can go for the sources of calcium which
are very important so you know the milk
and the leafy vegetables the cabbage
being sufficient all you can just have a
just give the heading and the forms of
calcium either it could be in the diet
or in the plasma and ionize non-ionized
form or in the bones as readily
accessible or stable calcium okay so
coming to the important functions or
important related to calcium and a ball
isn't it's like it for it's a
residential component for bone and teeth
also for muscle contraction for but
blood coagulation for nerve transmission
for membrane integrity for enzyme
activation and also affect on hormonal
release so all these are the important
functions related to calcium so if you
can put forward this chart it will be
really fetching so what are the factors
that promote calcium absorption and what
inhibit the calcium absorption if you
just if you write the heading and if you
give these and if you could explain a
bit that will be really fetching so
coming to the main thing so the main
heart of this answer
as a homeostasis so falcomon phosphorus
metabolism they mainly ask for the
homeostasis of how it has been being
balanced and how the equilibrium of the
calcium as well as phosphate is being
maintained by the human body so that is
mainly by these three hormones or these
restores to elements that is the
parathormone the 1:25 dihydroxy
cholecalciferol or calcitriol
and the calcitonin so these three play a
very important role in regulating the
calcium and phosphorus metabolism so you
can just give the introduction of what
is homeless taxes and then you can
answer of how these three play a very
important role the parathormone
and 125 dihydroxy cholecalciferol is
very important they play a very
important role in regulating the low
calcium levels in the serum so if there
is low calcium levels in the serum then
parathormone will be released by our
parathyroid gland which acts on the bone
and the kidney and as well as the
intestine to get back the calcium back
to the serum okay to get back the
calcium to the serum the acts so either
it increases the resorption of the bone
and also it causes intestinal absorption
like that so how it gets back or how the
serum gets back is like this if you can
draw at the bone and if you can even
draw a small kidney and you can if you
can explain that will be really fetching
okay so both parathormone
and the vitamin D plays an important
role when there is a low level of
calcium in the serum so you have to
explain like that so you can even give a
smile explanation of how the vitamin D
is being synthesized if it is essay
question so again you can give the
actions of the vitamin D like how it
causes it increases the calcium
absorption from the intestine and also
phosphate absorption and increases a
renal reabsorption of the calcium and
phosphorus or the phosphate so and it
how this is how it gets back or the
serum gets back its calcium and the
levels will get back to normal okay so
as I said the parathormone and the
vitamin D acts come into action come
into scene play when there is low
calcium level okay but if there is high
calcium level then again it has to be
back to normal right in that case
calcitonin comes into action so
calcitonin is being produced by para
follicular cells or the clear cells
which are present in the follicles of
the thyroid gland so these parathormone
and the calcitonin actually acts
opposite to each other antagonist of
each other so if there's high calcium in
the body or in the serum then calcitonin
comes and their juices it how it reduces
its it inhibits a-- or still class
mediated bone resorption so it it stops
the this option of the bone okay so
there will be no desorption of the bone
because of where's the serum calcium
will be decreased apart from that it
promotes renal excretion of calcium it
as a kidney to excrete more calcium
because of which the serum calcium will
come down this is how this both will act
opposite to each other
the same is in case of phosphate as well
so if the question is asked as a short
answer then calcium and phosphorus you
can combine together and you can write
if it is a stir and si answer then you
can split and write that is how you have
to increase the length of your answer
okay so coming to the disease states
it's always better to write at least few
applied aspects you can write half a
hyperparathyroidism okay you can just
put that the thyroid hormone is being
separated more than normal so if you can
write the chief complaint the tried of
this complaints it will be very useful
that is a bone stones and abdominal
groans so this is attractive for any of
the examiner's so you have to write and
highlight this point apart from that if
you can write others it's also good okay
if you can write the causes of these
hypocalcemia you can write again that
was hyperparathyroidism iya so you can
write these also so that's coming the
hyperparathyroidism so it could be
characterized by serum calcium level is
below than a normal range and it could
be the etiology of surgical removal or
diseases of the parathyroid glands or
congenital absence of the glands so you
can give this mild oral manifestations
okay and the diagnostic criteria of the
tetiny you can give so
hyperparathyroidism is leads to a
condition called as tetiny which
includes these signs at a swastika sign
and the Tosh's sign wherein
there is switching of the facial muscles
in the SWAT sketch sign and in the
trashiest sign there is car pop little
spasm when it is the speak no matter
puff speak no manometer puff is being
used so you can see the car pop little
spasm then so you can just if you write
these signs and if you can give a line
of description that's enough ok and next
condition is osteoporosis we know
increase adoption of the bone especially
in the older age adults and the other
condition is called as rickets it's good
due to the deficiency of 1 2 or 25
dihydroxy vitamin D so that is again
characterized by the calcification of
the normal bones as well as formation of
imperfectly calcified bone ok so these
are the conditions or the disease states
related to calcium if you can just name
and write at least few lines of
description that is enough so actually
applied aspects carries on 4 to 5 marks
in every question so if it is an essay
so it's better to write at least few
applied aspects it's again it's in your
department again if you can put forward
like if it is related to endo
endodontics I'll have can put related
took the dental caries and if it is
related to pareo you can put some other
thing which is related to general clear
clear fluid or whatever so wherever it
is again important in your respective
departments if you can put forward those
applied aspects even that will be really
fetching for you ok again coming to the
phosphorus you can give a mild
introduction later you can give the
sources of the phosphate or phosphorus
then coming to the factors affecting you
can give these factors which affect the
phosphorus or the phosphate absorption
so just give this if you can write and
if you can just give up one point your
answer line answers that's enough
later the important functions of the
phosphorus phosphorus or phosphate so
it's again the phosphate is for the bone
and teeth we know that and also for it
is important integral part of high
energy phosphate compounds at the ATP
gtp and or creatine and phosphate and
also essential component of nucleotide
coenzymes at the NADPH NADP Paradoxal
phosphate and also many phospholipids
for so proteins nuclei
it's all these important functions and
also is necessary for absorption and
metabolization of carbohydrates okay
so again you can give a homeostasis
which is maintained by these three that
is parathormone the vitamin D and
calcium nails so these two the first two
at if there is low level of phosphorus
or low level of phosphate and if the
callistonian acts if there is high level
of phosphorus in this serum okay and
they counteract that and brings back the
serum levels to normal so if you can
combine both calcium and phosphorous
metabolism it's in it's enough okay and
again this is States just put a words
like hypophosphatemia and the etiology
you can write okay and hypophosphatemia
you can write and the oral manifestation
so loosening and premature or losing of
the teeth and gingivitis and
radiographic findings because of
hypocalcemic asian there will be hypo
calcified teeth and all that things you
can write and presence of large chambers
pulp chambers and other condition is
called as a hypophosphatemia or hyper
phosphatase here so this as a deficiency
of enzyme alkaline phosphatase that
results in excretion of phosphorus and
all a mine in urine if you can write
it's enough or else it's okay so that's
it so you can conclude with that the
calcium and phosphorus metabolism is
very important for the normal body
metabolism or normal body functioning so
how does it important why it is
important what are the hormones that
play important role if you can put
lastly in the conclusion what is the
main homeostasis that is being occurring
for regulating this metabolism of
calcium and phosphorus if you can write
at the end it's enough so this is that's
it so references you can give your
biochem textbook a shambling them and
also you can give any good textbook like
Schaeffer and any articles if you have
gone through so that's a student so main
thing for calcium and phosphorus you
have to write the sources your functions
and the homeostasis so heart of the
topic is the homeostasis and those three
structures are the three sorry the three
elements that is parathormone vitamin D
and calcium in these three a play a very
important role so
have to put forward these three points
of how they play important role okay if
you can put it in a nice flow chart and
a nice diagram that will be really
fetching that's it students thank

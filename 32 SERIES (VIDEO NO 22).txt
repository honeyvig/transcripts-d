hello everyone this is dr. aamil from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss some important
points regarding cementum unpaired on
tellement coin number one if cementum is
not forward then exfoliation of teeth
may occur
number two incremental lines of salta
are only the resting lines number three
incremental lines are closer in a
cellular cementum because this cementum
is formed slowly number four a cellular
extrinsic fiber cementum helps in
Anchorage especially in single rooted
tip number five
cellular intrinsic fiber cementum is
formed in root surface and helps in case
of eruption and repair number six a
cellular fi brillar cementum is formed
when there is premature loss of residual
enamel epithelium protecting the newly
formed enamel at cervical region point
number seven width of para danta
ligament in egg adult sees 0.21
millimeters in mature adults is 0.18
millimeters and in older adults is 0.15
millimeters number 10 cement or internal
junction is the point which divides the
pulp tissue from the parent alignment
issue number 11 periodontal ligament
blood vessels are more in posterior
teeth than in anterior teeth number 12
periodontal ligament blood vessels are
greater in gingival third than apical
third number 13 P real results are
greater in mandible when compared to
mine Scylla number 14 higher content of
collision is seen in middle and apical
third of the root number 15
fibers which suspend tooth in socket or
oblique group of fibers number 16
cementec ELLs are found in parent a
ligament number 17
these cement akil's are calcified
epithelial cells number 18 this amine
diggle's are common in older individuals
on this size around 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm in
emitter number 19 sellers of series are
remnants of Denton lamina and desire
also called as epithelial pearls number
21 high degree of metabolic activity is
seen in stratum intermedium of enamel
organ number 22 enamel not and enamel
cord or transitory structures that act
as a reservoir for dividing cells number
23 enamel novel is translated to
structure that resembles Amla cos number
24 enamel septum is the transient
restructure their divides stay late red
clam into two parts number 25 the
basement membrane that separates the
enamel organ and dental papilla just
prior to dint information is called as
membrane up reformative are number 26
this membrane a preformed it wha is seen
in early Bell stage of tooth development
number 27 Hutchinson's teeth is a
developmental anomaly occurring during
MA for differentiation phase number 28
the intelligences imperfecta occurs
during history differentiation phase of
to development number 29 ectopic
expression of left one gene in or elect
areum results in ectopic tooth formation
number 30 obscene pearls are remnants of
dental lamina number 31 enamel police a
topic anomaly number 32 cementec ELLs
are dystopic calcifications
that's it for today's session guys hope
you all revised them well thank you

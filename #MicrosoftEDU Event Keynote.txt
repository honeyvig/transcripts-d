It was the tail end
of the First World War
in a remote
and a rural part of India.
My great grandfather
who was a marginal farmer
had just passed away
leaving my great
grandmother a young widow
with two sons
and no source of income.
To provide for her sons
and their future
she had to move to a town
nearby and make some
difficult choices.
She became a domestic servant,
but still could only afford
to send one
of her sons to school.
While the two boys
were close in age,
both in grade school,
one was seen as being
more responsible
while the other was
a bit of a troublemaker.
My great grandmother
opted to send
the more responsible
diligent son,
viewed as having more potential,
into the workforce.
He became a day laborer
at a construction site.
He would continue in that field
for the rest of his life,
never given the opportunity
to gain new skills
and gain higher
level employment.
The other son was sent
to the local school,
and that boy
was my grandfather.
Despite being seen as
being less responsible,
he continued through school
and eventually became
a police officer.
Despite entering the workforce
nearly a decade
after his brother,
his starting salary
was exponentially higher.
It was my grandfather's education
and the eventual career
that enabled my father
to pursue his own education,
which eventually allowed me
to follow my own passions.
The opportunity
my grandfather
was given impacted
the trajectories
of the generations to come.
This personal story reflects
that often repeated adage.
Talent is everywhere,
but opportunity is not.
Today's event is about
education and technology.
More specifically,
it is about empowering
the students of today
to create the world
of tomorrow.
We live as an amazing time
of technological progress.
Every aspect of our lives, economies,
and societies are being shaped
by digital technologies.
However, technology's also
creating disruption.
There is a growing concern
over job growth,
economic opportunity,
and the world we are building
for the next generation.
The real question is how can
technology create more opportunity,
not for a few, but for all?
Addressing that question
is core to our mission
to empower every person
and every organization
on the planet to achieve more.
This is not just
a set of words for us,
but something we
care deeply about.
Our success is measured
by others success.
Demarketising educational opportunity
speaks directly to our mission.
And it's one of the most
pressing societal challenges.
Technology can amplify
the work of
dedicated people
and institutions
but rarely can
substitute for it.
Kentaro Toyama,
a former researcher at Microsoft
and the author of the book, Geek Heresy,
captures it best when he says,
"That societal change requires
more than just technology."
Technocrats as term or reference
to them have a tendency
to extol the virtues
of technology and view
it as a remedy to all that ails the system.
I'm here today
as a heretic.
We are under no illusion
that technology alone
is the answer
to transforming education.
Dedicated administrators,
great teachers,
motivated students,
and involved parents
and communities
are the ones
changing education.
And technology is merely a tool
to empower their creativity
and their ingenuity.
It is this opportunity
that motivates our work in education
and everything
you'll see today.
One of my favorite parts
of the job
is to be able to see
and learn from the students
all around the world.
Over the past two years,
I've had a chance to visit students
from 20 plus countries,
to see students in Jakarta
and Tel Aviv use the same office
tools that my daughters use in Seattle.
How teachers in Tokyo
and Madrid are using Minecraft
to teach students
computational thinking.
How a group of young female
students in Cairo
were inspired
to learn to code,
and built an app to assist
the Syrian refugees
in their own community.
I've been struck by the commonalities
amongst the students.
Their ingenuity,
their thirst for learning.
Diversity and dreams for future.
As I've spent time
visiting these classrooms,
a few things stick
out to me each time.
First, technology should
help not hinder teacher's
work in the classroom.
Teachers have constant
demands on their time.
They must create curriculum,
grade tests,
and papers, manage classrooms,
discipline, educate,
and inspire.
Each time I leave a classroom
the job of a teacher
makes my job look easy
in comparison.
Technology should make teacher's lives
simpler and spark student's creativity
not distract from it.
This is a top priority
that we have focused on at Microsoft.
Today you'll see how
we're delivering an accessible,
streamlined platform readily available
to all classrooms.
So, teachers
spend less time
focused on technology
and more time doing
what they love doing,
inspiring students.
Secondly, the nature of work
is changing drastically.
Much of work today
happens in teams,
within groups of people working
together to solve a problem.
Where the sum becomes
greater than the parts.
We need to prepare our
students for this future.
And enable team-based learning
experiences in the classroom
amongst groups of students,
between students and teachers,
between teachers and parents.
What you will see today
is how any classroom
can promote learning
through collaboration,
hubs for teamwork,
personalized learning tools,
and the ability
to co-create.
By empowering students
to learn together,
their educational
opportunities get better.
Third, we must prepare
our students for tomorrow.
Consider the report
from the world economic forums
and the jobs report.
An estimated 65%
of the students
entering school today
will have jobs that
do not yet exist.
Teachers know this,
and they are hungry
to equip their students
for this future.
They know that
computational thinking
and problem-solving skills
are key to the future.
But they also know
that they need to take
a much broader view of STEM.
By bringing STEM
curriculum alongside reading,
writing, design,
and art, we'll set these
students up
for success in the future.
Throughout today's presentation,
we will show you
new technologies
designed to address
these needs.
And most importantly,
how technology can empower
students and teachers
to enhance learning
outcomes and create
a world of tomorrow.
Lastly, demarketising
educational opportunity
must be inclusive of everyone,
not just a select few.
To me, this is something
that's deeply personal.
This includes students
with disabilities
and different learning styles.
They must be given
an opportunity
to pursue their own dreams.
Dyslexia is estimated
to impact one in five people.
72% of the classrooms have students
with special learning needs.
Reading is an essential competency
and once a student falls far
behind it's difficult to catch up.
And it's not just
about reading.
You fall behind in
every other subject area.
This is something
that we aim to address
with the OneNote learning tools designed
specifically
to help students
with dyslexia,
but it can help students
everywhere with their reading
and writing skills.
It's been incredible to hear
the feedback from the teachers
using this to teach emerging
first-grade readers
or from parents who have exhausted
their options seeking help
for their dyslexic
children learning to read.
Or how a teacher in Macedonia
used the Learning Tools
to teach young students English.
We will take a look
at how these Learning Tools
and much more as Terry Myerson joins me today
to share more of the news.
To close, I want everyone
to imagine the world
we're building for tomorrow.
Just as my grandfather's opportunity
changed the trajectory
of our family,
this is what inspires me.
How can we collectively
come together to demarketise
the educational opportunity
for every student,
both for this generation
and the generations to come.
Thank you all very, very much.
- The true purpose of education
is to create possibility.
- Gone are the days where the teacher
can stand up in front of the classroom
and teach to the mythical middle.
- When you have learners who might not
be reading at grade level,
technology plays a very pivotal role
in the classroom.
- A lot of my students
have struggled for a long, long time.
- It was a little hard for me.
People laugh whenever
I read sometimes.
- I'll be nervous when I have to read out loud.
- Well, they knew how to read, and I didn't.
- Learning Tools not only reads to them
but gives them a better ability
to pick up the words on the page.
- It highlights the words to know where I am.
- When it's reading, I see spaces between the words.
- And it's easy to focus on.
- It helps me figure out big words.
- With Learning Tools they have
the ah-ha moment.
The light bulb goes off.
They feel empowered.
- The first time I actually
could read that book, I was proud of myself.
- I was very proud of myself.
- I want our students
to experience success,
and so if we can accelerate that,
if we can bring them up to speed,
that's what I want for them.
- When technology and education
come together,
possibility becomes reality.
- I want to read every book in here.
- Those kids just inspire me,
and their smiles remind me
why we create what we do.
The gift of technology
is that it can make life easier,
but the power of technology is
how it can just awaken
this human potential.
And the biggest, raw, untapped,
creative potential
resides in our schools.
The makers of tomorrow
are sitting in the classrooms today.
This is the next
generation of creators
who have embraced technology
as their first language.
The generation
of problem solvers
who naturally learn by creating,
collaborating, and communicating
with people all over the world.
The generation of inventors
who create with touch,
command with their voice,
and conceptualize in 3D.
Our team just loves
creating a medium
that empowers other people to create.
That ignites this creative impulse
all around the world.
That turns creativity
into this force
for positive change.
And our mission with Windows
is to create this platform
that inspires this creativity
in each of us.
And we're so gratified
that Windows 10 has been the global leader
for devices chosen
for K through
12 education.
With twice as many
Windows devices
shipped in 2016
as any alternative.
Teachers today are choosing Windows
for the rich creativity
inspiring applications like Autodesk SketchBook,
Adobe Photoshop, Minecraft,
and the rich Office
365 desktop applications
which do so much more than
the mobile apps available
on other platforms.
Teachers also choose Windows
for all the things
they can plug into Windows,
including these amazing
new STEM lesson plans
with Legos and Arduino boards.
Tools that enable accessibility
for every student.
Virtual reality headsets,
interactive whiteboards, and more.
But to understand
how we could do more,
our teams have
traveled the world.
We have talked to teachers
on the front line,
school principals,
and superintendents,
but most importantly
the creators in the classroom.
Because a complete solution
for education must scale
from classmate to classroom,
from school-wide to district-wide,
from system-wide to worldwide.
The teachers
were consistent.
Young kids, sometimes
they get distracted
and don't always
follow direction.
They asked for Windows
to be more resilient.
So literally hundreds of kids
interacting with each device
during the school year.
Maintaining the same great
battery life, fast log in time,
and overall performance
on the first day
of school as the last.
Ricardo Garmendia from the Renton
School District
told us how he manages
or supports 850 classrooms
with 11,000 Windows devices
in his school district.
And he was overwhelmed
with the ongoing of setup
of new devices each summer.
And the management
of the current devices
in the classroom all school year.
So to give students, teachers,
and administrators
like Ricardo what they need
we're taking a new approach.
Simplify to magnify.
Writers and storytellers
cut for pacing and music
you just still down
to a single hook
that can become
the song of the summer.
In sculpture,
you chip away all the stone
that doesn't look like David.
In software,
we code for elegance
because simplicity is power.
Well, I'm proud today
to introduce you
to Windows 10 S.
It is streamlined for simplicity.
It is secure.
And it runs with
superior performance.
But I personally like to think
of it as Windows 10 S,
the soul of today's Windows.
We've taken everything
that teachers need,
and millions of people
love about Windows 10
and created a new Windows experience
that's ideal for all of our creative endeavors
inside and out
of the classroom.
Let me show you
Windows 10 S.
So, here I am running Windows
10 S on a Surface Book.
Windows 10 S runs
on the full range
of Windows 10 hardware
like this powerful Surface Book,
but also the entry spec devices
that we find in classrooms
all over the world.
Now, the first thing
you'll notice about Windows 10
S is a new default
desktop image.
Just like we've streamlined Windows
10 to create Windows 10 S,
the default desktop image on Windows
10 S has been streamlined
and still beautiful.
Now, everything
that runs on Windows 10
S is downloaded
from the Windows Store,
which means first,
it's verified for security
and performance.
But then when it's downloaded
to the device it runs
in this safe container
to ensure that the execution
of the application
doesn't impact the overall performance
of the rest of the system,
allowing the performance
of the device
to be the same on day one as day 1,000 in use
of the device.
Now, there's many applications
within the Windows store,
but it's pretty exciting
to announce today
that the Office Suite,
the full desktop applications,
Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
Outlook and more
will be coming soon
to the Windows Store.
Now I mentioned also that Windows
have been chosen today
for the peripherals,
the things that teachers or students
are plugging into Windows.
Well, the full Windows
peripheral ecosystem
is available on Windows 10 S.
We're seeing incredibly
mixed reality headsets
being created
by our partners.
I'm so excited to the
classroom lesson plans
that are being created to go
with like Acer Virtual
Reality headset here
with this Surface Book.
But some of the most exciting stuff
that we're seeing
plugged into Windows
are these new lessons
for STEM education.
And so today what we're done here
is I've downloaded
from the store OBOT,
which is this Arduino-based robot.
You can see here
what a student has done
is programmed from scratch,
visually programmed from scratch
this lesson plan.
- Hello, humans.
I'm OBOT.
Who is programming me today?
Nice to meet you, Terry.
I love working with kids
to teach them how to code.
I'm already being used in over
1,000 schools around the world today.
I've got to say Windows 10 S
looks pretty impressive so far.
What else have you
got to show us, Terry?
- So, I mean I think down this showcase
you'll see many more.
There's just so many cool things
that are being plugged
into Windows 10 or Windows
10 S soon to enable
these great STEM lesson plans.
Now I've talked about how we've been
listening to teachers
and students to inspire Windows 10 S,
but we've also been doing
the same with Microsoft Edge.
Now Windows 10 S will run any web
browser in the Windows store,
but with Microsoft Edge,
it's inspired by teachers
and students as well.
So when recently we announced
the ability to set aside tabs,
what we were really doing at that time
was thinking about how a student
doing a research project would collect.
Here's the tabs of the research
I'm doing on the Solar System.
Here's the tabs related to the research
I'm doing on the Amazon Rainforest.
Here's the tabs associated
with my science research.
When we add annotation to Edge,
we're thinking about a scenario of a student
doing his research,
highlighting a section of a web page,
circling a section that they really enjoy,
and then sharing it with other teachers
or students in the classroom
they're doing their
collaborative work for.
So Microsoft Edge is
increasingly more focused
on being delightful for these teachers
and students in the classroom.
Now I mentioned every application
that runs on Windows
10 S gets downloaded from the store.
So what happens when a student tries
to download something,
not from the store?
Here we've created this fictitious
website Crazy Picture Editor,
and I will try and download
something and run it.
When you do, Windows 10 S
pops up this helpful dialog
letting you know the application
you just tried to run has not been verified
for security and safety by Microsoft.
What it does though
is offer you applications
in the store that do similar things.
So here it's recommending instead
of Crazy Picture Editor, Adobe Photoshop.
Now if a teacher or an administration
really wants to run that application
from the store at any time
they can go to that Windows store
and switch the device from Windows
10 S to Windows 10 Pro,
which would allow them
to install that application.
Now I mentioned maintaining
consistent performance
is so important
in the classroom.
The one scenario that's particularly
important in the classroom
is the first login
of a student.
In classrooms, we see these carts
of 30 or more devices
and students are coming in
and out of the classroom,
and they pick up
a random device.
And all the time it'll be
the first time they login.
And so we've been focused
on that with Windows 10 S.
So here I have two devices.
A Windows 10 Pro device
loaded up with several applications
that are commonly found
in the classroom.
We have Google Chrome installed.
Adobe Reader installed.
McAfee Anti-virus installed.
And that's it.
And over here we have
comparable applications
running on Windows 10 S.
And so maybe a student
logging into this device
for the very first time.
And you'll see that
the Windows 10 S device
is going to log in
for the very first time
for this student
in less than 15 seconds.
This 10 Pro device
will take 30,
40 seconds to log in.
More applications
would have it take
even longer to log in.
And so what this means
in the classroom
is the teacher can start
teaching quicker.
Doesn't have to keep
the students focus waiting
for a device to log in.
So this first login
performance is fantastic.
Now if the student has been
on this device before,
every login after
the first one on Windows 10
S will be less
than 5 seconds.
So, it's just great performance
on that first login.
Now, going back to the scenario
Ricardo talked about,
setting up new devices.
This is a scenario many teachers
think about during the summer
or school districts
are getting new devices
all the time.
So what we've done is we've
created a new application
called Set Up My School PCs.
And what happens is a teacher
or administrator
goes into a wizard.
They set up the wifi
network for their school.
Say these are gonna
go for my math cart.
Maybe set up a new desktop
image with the school logo.
Specify I'm setting up whether
a single student device
or a shared cart or a lab.
Specify what applications
they want on the device.
Here we're recommending
Office or Minecraft,
but they're not there by default.
A school chooses what they want.
But the end of this process,
what gets created
is a USB key.
And then what the teacher
or administrator
does is they collect
all their classroom PCs.
This is literally what we see
happen in the classroom.
And they'll take a PC
in any state.
This particular one
is just out of the box.
You plug in the USB key.
It's detected by Windows.
And in less than 30 seconds
I'll be able to pull this USB key
out of the device
and move on to the next one.
This system is configured
completely per the spec
that I put together
through this wizard.
There's a school in Colorado
couple weeks ago
decided to move to Windows
10 from Chromebooks,
and using the Set Up
My PC app they set up 600
PCs using 30 USB sticks in one day.
So, it's a pretty incredible process
to set up and configure a set of devices
exactly how the teachers
would like them to be.
Now, the last step
in our solution here
is Intune for Education.
I mentioned how Ricardo's got
11,000 PCs in his school district.
So, what we've done
is we've taken
our enterprise systems
management software,
and we've customized
it for schools.
Intune now knows
about carts and classrooms
and knows about teachers
versus students.
And what an administrator
can now do,
you can see this is Intune
for Education configured
for two high schools,
Contoso and Fabrikam.
The teachers
and students in each.
And an administrator during the school year
can go in and say,
oh, in this classroom
the students
at this high school, for example,
let's turn off the camera
in that classroom.
So all of the attributes
in the devices
that are in the school district,
if they're connected to
the Intune for Education,
that can now be centrally managed
with all the power
of this rich enterprise
management software
we've had for years
now customized for schools.
So that's Windows 10 S.
It's inspired by students
and teachers.
It runs full,
rich applications
that are secure
and verified by Microsoft.
It's easy to set up and manage.
And it will have
the same performance
on the first day
of school as the last.
It really is the soul
of today's Windows.
Now the world benefits
when all students all over the planet
have access to this latest technology.
Windows achieves this scale
through our partners both our OEMs
and software developers globally.
And our goals with Windows
10 S is to develop
the same vibrant partner-centric
ecosystem we have today.
Our partners, including Acer,
Asus, Dell,
Fujitsu, HP, Samsung,
and Toshiba offer a range
of new education ...
Windows 10 PCs for education today
starting at only $189.
These partners
will offer these devices
and new, beautiful,
premium devices
with Windows
10 S in the coming months.
But I'm excited
to announce more.
All of these new
education devices
will now come with a free
one-year subscription
to Minecraft Education Edition.
And we are making Windows
10 S free for all schools on
any of their current
Windows Pro PCs.
And that Office 365
for Education
is also free for teachers
and students worldwide.
And, today, Microsoft
Intune for Education
becomes broadly available
for administrators worldwide.
So, Windows
10 S devices,
Office 365, and Minecraft,
this is our complete
solution for education.
And all of it will be
available this summer,
ready for the new school year.
So, on top of Windows
10 S now we want to show you
some incredible
education experiences.
First, we've created
a natural way
to foster collaboration
and encourage creativity
in every classroom
of every school
with Microsoft Teams and Office 365.
Then we have Minecraft.
What continues to amaze me
about Minecraft
is that this is a video game
that has become such
an important learning tool
to teach teamwork, logical thinking,
and problem-solving.
And then we have to take
a look at mixed reality,
and how it's just this magical
teaching and learning environment.
Over the past five years
I've been fortunate enough
to experience
battling aliens,
fixing a Japan Airlines
jet engine,
and even walking
on Mars with NASA,
but when I see how it is
bringing a whole new dimension
to teaching and learning
it really makes me think
how awesome it would be
to be a student again.
So, let's start
with Microsoft Teams.
Please welcome Catherine.
- Good morning, everybody.
As Sachi has shared,
we believe that
education unlocks potential.
And that technology
can empower teachers
and students to create
the world of tomorrow.
With over 100
million active users,
Office 365 empowers
individuals, teams,
and organizations
to communicate
and collaborate every day.
And Office 365
for Education
builds on this rich foundation
to offer the broadest
and deepest toolkit
for content creation,
personalized learning,
and modern classroom
collaboration.
So to share some ways
that Office 365
is used in today's classroom,
it's my privilege
to welcome Anthony Newbold,
the principal at Bear Creek
Middle School in Fairburn, Georgia.
Good morning.
- Thank you, Catherine.
- Absolutely.
- Good morning.
18 years ago I started
my education career
right across the river
in Patterson, New Jersey.
And in that time, I've served
as a teacher and an administrator.
And over the years
I've watched as education
has matured and grown
in amazing ways.
Now, teachers are instrumental
in any classroom with technology.
They can engage and improve
their students learning experiences.
- Now, Anthony,
I've had the opportunity
to hear how you use Office
365 at Bear Creek.
Can you give some examples?
- Absolutely.
Now as you all saw in the video,
we use Learning Tools at Bear Creek.
And it's impressive
to see how many students
are taking more academic risk
now that they're feeling
more comfortable with reading.
Students also improved
their writing skills
by using tools such as Editor
and Researcher in Word.
And as usual, PowerPoint is
a pretty popular presentation tool.
Now we also use OneNote Class
Notebook as a digital binder
in the classroom.
Our art teacher, Mr. Smith,
has students capture their artwork,
and now they have
a digital portfolio.
Ms. Thompson, one of
our history teachers,
you saw her in the video.
She encourages her students
to share their digital class
notes with their peers.
And Dr. Prewitt,
a physical science teacher,
encourages her students to review
their Cornell notes
right before any exam.
So we're seeing
some great results
already with Office 365,
and I can't wait to see
how some of the technology
we're gonna hear about today
is gonna impact student achievement.
- That sounds great.
I loved hearing the stories
of how you use Office
365 in your classrooms at Bear Creek.
But are you ready for what's next?
- Let's do it.
- All right.
So, in March we launched
Microsoft Teams,
a chat-based workspace
as the newest addition
to Office 365.
And today I'm proud to announce
new classroom experiences
as part of Microsoft Teams.
These new features
will make it
the digital hub for teachers and students.
Teams will help teachers
with their daily activities
and will help students
prepare for the future.
So, let's take a look.
On the left ...
This is Microsoft Teams.
On the left, you'll see
all the classes
that a teacher is responsible for,
and project groups that they
assign to their students.
In addition, all of these are set up
automatically at the start of a school year
including the student roster
and always kept up to date.
And teachers can communicate
with their students
and collaborate,
but they can also collaborate
with their peers.
Down below you see
that Bear Creek
Middle School staff
section right there.
Up at the top,
you'll notice the tabs.
This provides easy access
to information that teachers
and students need like files,
the OneNote Class Notebook,
assignments, quizzes, and more.
And teachers
can customize these tabs
for their class or a project group
making sure the students
have what they need
anywhere, anytime.
And the magic happens
in the conversation.
And that's in the center.
This provides a persistent,
rich interaction between
the teacher
and the students
so they can learn,
they can read,
they can interact
real-time in the classroom
or at home when they're studying
for that last minute test.
And what's great
is if a student misses
a few days or joins mid-semester,
they have all the recorded
conversation and content
that they need
to have context.
So, Anthony, you've had
some opportunity
to get a sneak peak on Teams.
Can you talk a bit about
how you see using it in your classrooms?
- Absolutely.
So there are so many learning resources
beyond the four walls
of your typical classroom,
but because of cost and time,
we can't always bring them
into the classroom.
It's easy with Microsoft Teams
to connect to more of those
external learning resources.
So, for example,
I can introduce a new unit
to my World History class
by bringing in an anthropologist
into the classroom
with a video call.
This enables students
to interact with a professional,
and seek the information
that matters most to them.
But the real beauty of this
is now students can question
and engage
each other versus
just simply reading it
out of a textbook
or online from an article.
Engaging students in the class
discussion is a challenge.
Now some students
are gonna be shy.
Others may be what we call
overly spirited if you will.
The students
will love this tool.
So I have a 13-year old daughter,
and I watch her text,
and I know how she uses emojis.
So now the students can bring
in emojis, stickers, and GIFs.
As a result, we can
get more students involved
as you see here
in the conversation tab.
Now in this particular tab,
I'm happy to see that
all of the students
use proper chat etiquette.
But if they didn't, it's okay.
I'll use that as what we refer
to as a teachable moment.
And I have complete control.
I can delete a message.
I can mute a student
or the entire class if need be.
And in this conversation
you'll see Polly.
Now Polly is this
pretty cool polling bot,
so I can create a poll.
And now I can facilitate
student engagement
in exciting new ways.
Teachers can tailor
their class experience
and add some interesting
apps from Microsoft
and some of our
favorite edu apps.
And that provides fun, dynamic,
and informative tools
for teachers and students.
Now every student
has choice and voice
on how they choose
to engage in the classroom.
If you talk to any teacher,
they'll tell you that once they grab
a students attention the lessons
and the content come alive,
and ignite deeper learning.
Now as educators
we must focus on
preparing our students
for their future.
And to that end collaboration
and communication are key.
Now on top of learning
the new material,
developing and honing
those collaboration skills
is something that we can model
in our assignments.
As a part of this class,
I've broken them up
into various groups
to work on a project.
So, let's take a look
and see how they're doing.
So I see here
that this particular group
has already started on some different
aspects of the project.
They seem to have
some questions here,
so let's go in and take
a look at their document
to see how they're
coming along.
So it appears here
that I have a couple of students
who are already working
on this right now.
You can see it in real time.
The students can also see
each other's changes
in real-time no matter where they are physically.
Now even though this particular
group chose to Word
for their online assignment, other tools like
Excel and PowerPoint also
have those co-authoring capabilities.
As I continue to scan through
this particular document,
I see that they're missing one key
cultural aspect of government.
Now I can go back
to the conversation thread
and provide feedback
with an at mention.
Once I do that, every student
instantly receives notification.
And now they have the
confidence and information
they need to keep moving forward.
But the rich, persistent
conversation experience
in Teams takes classroom collaboration
to a whole new level.
This group, for instance,
is on a video call.
Everyone knows that
in today's busy world
it's often challenging to get students
together in one place.
Although they seem to message
each other all the time,
sometimes that face
to face interaction
is absolutely necessary.
Hey, guys.
I love how naturally the students
can now work together with Microsoft Teams.
And if you will, I'd like to share
with you just one more thing today.
Because we're also using OneNote,
students can even review concepts
that were previously taught.
So, you see here
I posted a map
that I used to teach a lesson in class.
So if a student is absent,
they can just go back, hit play,
and the steps that I took
while teaching the lesson are
instantly revealed to them.
It's metacognition.
And that's some teacher
talk for ensuring
that the students understand
the process of getting to the answer.
My favorite,
my greatest gratification
is when students are achieving
their learning goals
and acquiring
those life skills.
But what really hits home
is how I can redefine
what a classroom
means for my teachers
and students.
Office 365 for Education now
with Microsoft Teams
brings in resources
from around the world
providing the students
with anytime,
anywhere access to the skills
that I know that they will need
to be successful in their future.
- So, Anthony just
shared how Microsoft
is helping redefine classroom collaboration.
These new classroom experiences
for teams are available today
in private preview
and will launch
worldwide this summer.
Thank you so much,
Anthony for sharing
how you use Office
365 in your classroom.
You're an amazing principal
and an inspiration.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
So we just talked about
engaging students
as part of the modern
collaborative classroom.
Another way teachers are sparking
their student's creativity
is by learning by doing.
And at Microsoft, we've been
running pop-up STEM classrooms
for the past year
with thousands of educators
around the world.
We've built standards
aligned STEM lesson plans
that are targeted to
middle school students,
and are available to download for free.
These STEM projects use
everyday objects
like paper cups, straws,
and string to make sure
that learning is affordable
and accessible to everyone.
For example,
this sensorized glove project
has students use copper tape,
Velostat,
and cardboard to make
a flex sensor for a quarter.
25 cents.
And after completely the sensor,
students can control a robotic finger
made from a straw.
And stream live data into
Excel that measures the flexion
and extension of their finger.
How cool is that?
By mastering these skills,
students can use
their imagination
and creativity
to make something
of their own driven
simply by their passion.
Like this dragon
designed by students
from Rosehill Middle School.
Building on our experience
with the National PTA,
today we're excited to announce
that starting this Saturday,
for the month of May,
we'll bring
these pop-up
STEM classroom experiences
to the Microsoft
Stores across the country.
And this summer,
we'll host STEM
summer camp programs
at select Microsoft Stores.
So this was just one example
of how students
can bring their creativity
into the classroom.
And now let's explore how learning
by doing sparks creativity
in the virtual world of Minecraft.
So, please join me in welcoming
Deirdre to talk about it.
- Hello.
I know some of you
remember the very first
video game you finished.
Mine was Super Mario Brothers.
I was 11, but I can still hear that music
and feel the controller in my hands.
My best friend and I played every day
after school for months learning
how to defeat each enemy,
memorizing the timing
and how to solve each puzzle.
We basically created a study guide
from what we were learning
so that we could solve
the last level.
And what I can see now is that
we were learning as we played.
Now I think about this experience
when I see students
and educators
using Minecraft in schools.
Minecraft is already transforming
how people teach and learn.
Minecraft has over 100
million players worldwide.
And today, just a few months
after launching,
schools in over 100 countries
are using Minecraft
Education Edition.
Teachers have created hundreds
of lesson plans
to show the potential
for Minecraft in any lesson.
In fact, one of the very
first lessons shared with us
was from a teacher
named Simon in the U.K.
He was using Minecraft
with his middle school students.
He asked them to create
a Mars habitat in Minecraft.
The students got started
right away planning
what humans would need
to survive on Mars.
And like Matt Damon's character
in The Martian,
solving the problem
of how to grow food
in a Martian landscape
and using math to manage
their resources.
When I visit classrooms
like Simon's,
I see players debating,
negotiating, and working together.
Educators like Simon are
amazed and encouraged
by the level
of student engagement
when they use Minecraft,
and how it opens up
creative exploration
across the curriculum.
So, how can Minecraft
make a difference
with computer science education?
I first learned coding
when I was nine.
And later was one
of just two girls in my AP
computer science class in high school.
25 years later, the way that we teach
coding has barely changed,
and women make up
less than 20%
of professional software engineers.
Efforts like code.org's
Hour of Code
and the USCS initiative
have made huge strides
breaking down the barriers
and showing the power of computing
to solve problems.
And games are playing
an important role too.
The Minecraft
Hour of Code tutorials
on code.org
have passed over
50 million play sessions
with students and educators
around the world.
So it makes sense
that one of the top
requests that my team hears
is a growing urgency
from educators
and from school leaders
to inject technology into their curriculum,
specifically computer science
and coding.
So that's why today I'm proud
to announce Code Builder
for Minecraft Education Edition.
Code Builder is
a new Minecraft
extension that lets players build, move around,
and create in Minecraft
by writing code.
Let me show you how it works.
You're gonna write code today
to search for water on Mars.
Let's start with the Mars
exploration world
from Simon's class.
We're gonna enter
right into the world,
and you can see the habitat they built
and their interpretation
of a Martian landscape.
Once we go inside Minecraft,
you can start Code Builder
just by typing slash code.
With that, you can connect
to popular learn
to code packages
like Tynker and ScratchX from MIT,
or you can even
add your own service.
Today you're gonna use Tynker,
which has custom blocks and commands
that are connected to Minecraft.
Now back in Minecraft,
you're gonna see your agent
or a sidekick appears
to execute the code
that you write.
Students really love the agent.
It's a great way
for them to get started.
Make that experience
even more personal.
In Tynker you drag
and drop blocks of code
to create a tunnel program
that moves the agent
and digs down to discover
what's beneath the surface.
In this example,
we're gonna use the agent
to dig a tunnel outside
so that we're safe
from the elements on Mars.
But Minecraft players out there
can imagine dozens of uses
for programming the agent
like mining all night
or building a lit path to your farm
while you work on your house.
So here the agent's
gone to work running code.
Digging down and identifying
the resources that are underground.
If you're more experienced,
you can even switch from blocks
to Javascript and run code
without the agent
to go even faster.
Using Code Builder students
will be able to create
some really cool stuff.
And like my own experience
with Super Mario Brothers,
they'll be learning as they play.
Let's hear from someone
who's seen this firsthand.
A high school STEM teacher who runs
a girl's coding workshop
was recently selected as a PBS digital innovator
and has been working
with her students
with Code Builder and Minecraft
for the past few months.
Please join me in welcoming
Melissa Wrenchey.
- Hi, Deirdre.
- Hi, Melissa.
So, tell us about your experience
with Minecraft and Code Builder.
- You know what's cool?
I'm working on a project
with my language arts teacher.
She wanted a better simulation tool
than she had had before.
She wanted her students
to actually get in and build it.
So, here you're looking
at Shakespeare's time,
you're looking at the Globe Theater.
So most people can look at a simulation,
but instead what we're going to do
is have students actually build the Globe
Theater and set the stage for this.
So, you have your balconies here.
You have the Groundlings area.
So what we'll have happen is students
are going to actually be building
currently the Globe Theater itself.
You're also gonna set the stage
with what this place look like.
So, there's gonna be some houses
that are gonna be built for the patrons
because those were typically nicer.
And then you're also going
to have the Code Builder's
going to build the homes for the people
that they were called the Groundlings.
So you're setting that stage for what
it was like in Shakespeare's time.
There's more examples here.
So, for instance,
here you're watching the agent
is actually 3D printing a windmill.
You see the finished project here,
but here it is checking X,
Y, and Z coordinates for building
that automatically.
And then finally we'll go
to our last example here.
There's your two agents
that Deirdre talked about earlier.
And the two agents are building,
in this case, the Parthenon.
So imagine what you
have here is a column.
There's 70 columns that are needing
to be built for the Parthenon.
So, what you can do here is actually
have the agent create one column,
and then use a loop to actually
build the rest of the columns.
So, it's perfect example
of using algorithmic thinking.
- Thank you so much for showing those examples.
Does anyone every ask you
how you can use Minecraft in your classroom?
- I do, I get that a lot.
But I would always point them
to our Minecraft mentors.
They do a great job of writing
resources that they've been using.
Lesson plans.
There's the website to go to.
And things that have
been successful for them.
They're really helpful
with a lot of questions.
And the last piece I would point out to you
is that computational
thinking piece we talk about.
It's computer science,
and this Code Builder does a great job
of teaching those concepts.
- Great.
Thank you so much for being here
and showing those examples
from your class, Melissa.
- Thanks.
- When I look
at those examples,
what these students are creating,
and I think about my own experience
developing some pretty great problem
solving and study skills
in Super Mario Brothers,
and I look at my two daughters today,
I feel a real sense of urgency
to put these tools in the hands
of educators and students.
From the 50 million
Hour of Code sessions,
and the examples
from Simon and Melissa,
we know it's engaging.
We know it's working.
And we know it's reaching
both boys and girls.
How cool is it that my daughters
could build and fly
through the Parthenon
or program a virtual 3D
printer in Minecraft?
And how different from the way
coding's been taught
for more than 25 years?
I know that with tools like
this we can inspire
the next generation
of creators, leaders,
and innovators.
Starting today, you can
give Code Builder
a try with a free trial
of Minecraft Education Edition,
and the brand new beta
of Code Builder.
Both available for schools
right now
at education.minecraft.net.
Next, I'm going to introduce Megan
who will talk more about
the potential for 3D
and mixed reality
in education.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
My name is Megan Saunders,
and I lead our initiative
around 3D
for everyone at Microsoft.
And I'm so excited
to talk to you today
about the magic of 3D,
mixed reality,
and education.
Now, as humans, we learn
from the real world around us.
We learn by reading,
by experiencing things first hands,
and by doing.
It's part of who we are.
But today we not only learn
from the real world,
we also have created new ways
to learn with technology.
We can see kids create
in rich 3D worlds like Minecraft.
There they can bring
their ideas to life,
and they can creatively explore,
and problem solve
right in the moment.
So, how do we bring the benefit
of our real world
and this digital world together?
We call this mixed reality.
And mixed reality
begins with 3D content.
Now research tells us
that 3D improves
attention span,
engagement, motivation,
and overall academic performance.
And my personal favorite,
girls enroll in math
and science classes
at a much higher rate
after taking a course in 3D.
So today we're gonna show you
a number of demos
that highlight some
of the benefits of 3D
in and out of the classroom.
Now schools have
different access
to different resources.
So we're gonna show you
a wide range of tools
that educators can use.
So I'm very excited now
to introduce you to Amy
from our development team
who is going to help us
on this next set of demos.
- Megan.
Let's get started
in Microsoft Teams.
Here students have
a new assignment
around little-known space facts.
And there are a lot of questions
around when eclipses happen,
so I'm gonna use Paint 3D
and PowerPoint to bring the idea
of eclipses to life.
Paint 3D is free
in Windows 10
and is one of the easiest ways
to create in 3D.
Here, teachers
can create classroom boards
and stock them full of models
for their students
to use in their projects.
Now I'm gonna build
the Solar System.
So, the first thing
I need is the sun.
Drop it in.
Then I'll go back to the board
and add the Earth and the Moon.
Just scale them down.
Now, let's make our sun
a little more realistic.
Here in the stickers tab
I can add any 2D image from my PC
and create a custom sticker
just like a texture.
I've already added
this lava sticker,
and we'll go ahead
and place it on the sun.
Stick it on.
Nice.
Okay, now we just want
to line everything up.
So, we'll grab the Earth
and the Moon.
Move them into position,
and because we're working in 3D,
I can move back and forth in space.
Great.
So the Moon travels
around the Earth every 29 days.
And based on this
tapped down view,
you'd think that we would
have eclipses every month.
But as soon as we change
our perspective,
you can see that the Moon's
orbit is actually tilted.
So it's not causing an eclipse.
Now that we've used Paint 3D
to see why we don't
have eclipses every month
let's finish this project in PowerPoint
and see when they do happen.
Coming this fall,
adding 3D
models to your slides in PowerPoint
will be as easy
as adding a 2D image.
All you'll do is go
to insert, 3D models.
Grab the model we just
finished in Paint 3D,
and drop it in.
Now, I'm not an animator
by any means,
but PowerPoint will actually animate
my 3D objects for me.
All I'll do is
duplicate the slide,
select the model,
rotate it to show the tilt.
Just about there.
And then go to transitions
and apply the morph transition.
Nice.
Okay.
I finished the entire
presentation earlier,
so let's go ahead
and take a look at it.
Here we go.
Because of the Moon's
orbital tilt,
we don't have eclipses every month.
But let's fast
forward three months.
Now the Moon's orbit will
align with the sun
and the Earth to block the sunlight
and cause a total solar eclipse.
The next time this is going
to happen is on August 21st
when an eclipse will travel
across the United States
from the West to the East Coast.
Thank you.
- That was a great presentation, Amy.
So we just saw how Amy could simplify
a complex learning point using 3D
with Paint 3D and Office.
Let's extend
on that concept.
The class is working
on another project
around the Curiosity rover,
and the teacher has just loaded
a model of the Curiosity
from NASA's website
to Microsoft Teams.
- I've actually already
downloaded the model,
and I've got it open over here.
Now, most people think that the Curiosity
is about the size of a small lawnmower.
In this view, I can spin it around,
see it from a couple different angles,
but I can't really get a sense of its size.
- Now, Amy is showing us
how we can see 3D content in our screen,
but I'm excited to announce
a new feature
coming to Windows
10 this fall that allows you to view 3D
content through your screen.
Kind of like a magic window.
We call this new
feature View Mixed Reality.
Now, this feature
is not only available
on what Amy is showing today,
but it's gonna be available
in a wide range of experiences.
Okay.
So, Amy, I'm 5'11".
How big is the Curiosity?
- Let's find out.
You could head towards the back of the stage.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna drop the rover right next to you.
- Like about here?
- Perfect.
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.
Nice.
Let's capture this.
Yeah.
At seven feet tall
and nearly 2,000 pounds,
it's pretty unbelievable
that we've landed this on Mars.
- With View Mixed Reality,
we can bring this rover
that was over 250 million miles
away right into the classroom,
giving us this unique perspective
to understand the Curiosity's scale
and size in the relation
to the world around us.
In this case, me.
Now, here's the good news.
All of this can be done
on any classroom Windows
10 PC that just has a simple RGB camera.
Even a plugged in web cam will work.
And it's free.
So we just saw some examples
of how we could simplify the complex
using mixed reality,
but let's pivot and see how we can
learn through experience.
Now, field trips are a great way
to enable experiential learning.
But not all schools can offer
as many field trips as they would like.
But with Windows
Mixed Reality devices
we can bring those field trips
right into the classroom.
Now, Amy's going to be using one
of these new affordable headsets
to take us on a trip into the future far, far away.
Guess where we're going?
Yep.
We're going to explore space.
- I'm looking at the Solar System
in a way that used to be impossible.
In textbooks, the eight planets
are usually shown in a straight line,
but in this immersive view
I can actually move around
and get a sense for how they're spread across space.
- Now, these types of applications
can be really rich
for self-guided learning.
Not only can Amy explore
our Solar System,
but she can travel through time.
And in this case, into the future
where the year is 2492.
Now, this will be the next time
that the eight major planets
are in closest proximity to one another.
The last time this happened
was about 1,000 years ago.
- Zooming in I can see how the planets will look
when they're grouped closer
together 500 years from now.
What a cool way to learn about space.
- It's this type of immersive education
that can enable any student
to explore the world
or even the galaxy
without even leaving the classroom.
Thank you, Amy.
- Thanks, Megan.
- We are so excited
about the opportunity for 3D
and mixed reality and learning,
and we're not the only ones.
Pearson, one of the largest
education company's in the world,
has just begun to integrate 3D
and mixed reality
into their secondary
and university level curriculum.
They're gonna be offering
courses in commerce,
history, health, and STEM.
So, in the school year 2018,
any student can take
any one of these courses
on any Windows
Mixed Reality device.
Yes, it's good. Wow. I heard a wow. It's great.
Because this is
the future of learning.
So, let's take a look at that
future curriculum with Microsoft HoloLens.
- I was tired of
preparing kids for yesterday.
You're always preparing kids
for this world
that didn't really exist anymore,
and it wasn't going to exist
when they graduated.
And I wanted to get my kids to the point
where they could actually
build the future.
- We've seen a fundamental shift
already in how
a lot of educational resources
are being delivered.
We've seen a shift
from print books through to ebooks.
And I think the next evolution
of that is from books
to mixed reality.
- As I started preparing
my lectures and thinking
how I'm gonna communicate
this to the students,
one thing I wished is I had a 3D chalkboard.
- You actually have all these
tools that allow students
to generate content
for other students,
which means that you could have students
that are subject matter
experts informing the development
of experiences
to help teach content
that they're learning about
in their other classes.
And that's just amazing.
- With the HoloLens our idea
for an app was
if you didn't have access
to all different instruments,
you could learn them.
I feel like being able
to interact with something
is what makes you
remember it more.
- I'm a visual learner.
I'm someone who learns by experiences
as opposed to just reading
it out of a book.
And so having the HoloLens
put that visual in front of you
makes things much easier.
- We could use mixed reality for agriculture.
- Science classes.
- Geography.
- Math would be a big one.
- It provides a much more
engaging experience for students,
and that's the ultimate goal for a teacher
is to engage the students
and have them learning.
- From 3D in your screen
to the world is your screen,
mixed reality is the future,
and it's available today.
We have a wide range
of tools for educators
that they can use to create curriculum
for their students and peers.
From Paint 3D and Office
to View Mixed Reality
to those immersive Windows
Mixed Reality headsets
coming this holiday starting at 299.
With 3D and mixed
reality and Windows 10,
any student can simplify the complex,
can creativity learn
through experience,
and can gain new understanding
by bridging their digital
and physical worlds.
Creativity leads to learning.
Learning leads to innovation
and the future.
Thank you.
- Our aim is to unleash
the creative potential
of hundreds of millions
of next generation creators.
Whether they paint
by colors or numbers,
sculpt in 3D or code,
design new worlds or buildings,
compose symphony's
of music or science,
create ideas or possibilities.
However, they choose
to create we are building
Microsoft Education
for each of them.
We want Windows 10,
Office 365, Minecraft,
and Mixed Reality to be
the place for creators
in the classroom to create,
learn, and play.
But our commitment
to education goes further.
We've focused so far today
on how we seek
to inspire students
from kindergarten through
to twelfth grade.
But Windows 10 S
will also be great
for higher education students.
And when I think about
the right device
for them only one thing
comes to mind.
The most soulful expression
of Windows needs
to run on the most soulful
expression of a Windows device.
Please welcome Panos.
- So cool.
What a day, right?
It's been crazy.
It's so incredible.
This day of learning,
it brings us inspiration
when you think about
teachers and students
and how that
all comes together.
For me, in planning this event,
it pushed me very hard to think
what are those moments?
What are those most impactful
moments in my life?
Those moments where
I was learning most
or where the teachings
were coming to life.
And it really pulled me back.
It pulled me all the way
back to the teaching
I would get from my dad,
which is such an important
part of my life.
Now check this out.
That's my dad.
Hopefully, you look at this picture,
and you go, "Hey, that's his dad."
Right?
I look at the picture, and I go look
at my blue leisure suit
because it's pretty hot.
And then I wonder why they continuously dressed
my brother and I the same way.
That happened for years,
and it was awful.
Anyway.
So, now that I'm done with my therapy.
My dad was an engineer.
He was a hardware engineer.
He was a guy
that he wanted
to put things together
with his hands.
He wanted to
take them apart.
He wanted to learn how they worked.
And that was a big deal.
When I was growing up,
my dad and I shared a room.
It was my bedroom, and it was his office.
And that was special to me.
That was special
for many years of my life
because his desk
was in my room.
And my mom would put me
to bed at night,
and that was awesome,
and I'd pretend I was asleep,
and I'd lay there.
And maybe 30 minutes
or an hour later
my dad would come in.
He was relentless.
He'd come in every night,
and he'd go to work.
And I would creep out of bed,
and I would go sit next to him.
And he let that happen.
I don't think we ever told
my mom because I'm like,
"Hey, Dad, do we have a picture?" And he's like,
"No, we never told your mom."
Those were the moments
that you can pull all the way
back to from a learning standpoint.
He used to teach me.
We would hand build TVs together.
And he would teach me.
I was six, seven, eight, nine.
It took us a long time,
but he would talk about every single
detail and how it mattered.
And then if you got it wrong,
you had to do it again.
And you had to do it again,
and then again.
But it mattered that you
didn't miss anything
because if you put everything
you had into this product,
then you were gonna get everything
that you wanted out of it.
And he would say it.
He'd say it to me.
"When we watch this TV you're gonna love this
TV better than any other one."
Because I'd ask Dad,
"Why don't we just buy a TV?"
If I only knew what he was
teaching me back then.
Because right now I'm reminded
of that exact same feeling
in the work we do in Surface and in Windows
and now across Microsoft.
This is a culture driven
by passion like real passion.
That same passion my dad
had in teaching me
how to put a TV together.
It's a culture driven by iteration.
And it's also a culture driven by learning.
And the best thing about making a product
every day with a team is this.
I'm surrounded by some of the best
product makers on the planet.
The best.
But they put their heart
and soul into every single detail.
It doesn't matter
if it's the tiniest hinge
or the creation of an entire category.
Their heart and soul goes into it.
It doesn't matter if it's the bit
that we align to the pixel on the screen.
And it turns out the more you look
at it you start to realize
it's not actually all these
little details and parts
that make these devices great.
But it's all the passion
that the people making these products
put into them that make them great.
It's that same passion
we want you to feel
when you're using our products.
That same energy that resonated with me
when I watched TV with my dad.
And that can be true.
It's actually true
for our entire Surface family.
If you haven't picked up a Pro, you should.
And there's many of you using them,
and I'm super pumped
about that by the way
because I can't remember the last time that happened.
Thank goodness.
If you haven't used a Book,
you should take top off,
reverse it, fold it down, take the pen out, and create.
Let your energy come into that.
Push the GPU.
If you haven't seen touched
or felt a Studio, you have to.
Put your hands on it,
pull it towards you,
immerse yourself into it.
Hey, Sue.
You have done an amazing job today.
Has she been amazing?
Your work is inspiring,
and you make that Studio look absolutely beautiful.
I love that.
I mean you bring it to life.
The way it's meant to disappear,
and you're creations show up here.
It is wonderful.
And we are finding that people
are using Surfaces just like that.
Now each one of these products
has pushed the boundaries of innovation.
They're products
that help you create.
They're products
that help you think.
They help you love do
what you love doing most.
That's true.
They help you be more productive.
But it's not the product.
It's the product disappearing
into the background,
and it's the mind that gets
to go into that product.
To create what needs
to be created.
Your musings, your learnings.
Everything you think
about comes together
through this seamless dance
of hardware and software.
And in essence,
every one of these products,
they're made for creators.
And we've said this.
Don't be confused.
You may be a creator of a spreadsheet
or a symphony or a novel or a drawing,
but what about the student?
What do they create?
Can you imagine?
They are creators
of their entrance essays.
The thing that impacts
the next four years
of their magical lives.
Should the technology
be in their way?
And today is all about
students, isn't it?
And for Surface specifically,
this is where we wanted
to put our focus.
Into those next four years
of a student's life.
When they're just about
to get out of high school.
When they don't even know
what their major is.
We wanted to bring them a product
that they could have so much confidence
in they didn't have
to worry about it.
Now we know today,
we know today many students,
many students who use Surface Pro,
and we love that.
It's cool.
And a lot of them use Book
because they do need that DGPU in it,
and they push it.
But they're asking for more.
They're clearly asking for more.
And we talked to a lot of them.
We love them.
There's some students here,
and we love you.
- We love you too.
- They're asking for a laptop, right?
They're asking
for a Surface laptop.
Cool.
They want a bit of a choice.
They want a product that's gonna continue
to empower them and remove every limit.
Have you, have you
watched a student lately?
Have you seen what
they can accomplish?
Have you seen what they can do?
Just watch.
Their minds, their hands.
They move so fast.
They come out of school.
They come into Microsoft.
They run circles around me.
Circles.
I'm almost embarrassed sometimes
how fast they're
moving compared to me.
It is extraordinary.
They create fast.
They think fast.
Nothing should stop them.
Nothing should get in their way.
There should be no technology
that stands in front of them.
And isn't that
what Surface is?
Isn't it?
The technology that disappears
to the background.
So to give that perfect laptop,
to marry the hardware
and software together,
the team across Windows
and Surface and Office
had to look at everything
from the materials
to the science
to the architecture.
Every bit of our experience
in making products
had to come to life,
and we had to re-examine
the entire laptop market.
And then push those same
boundaries of innovation
you see pushed in the other
Surface products into this product.
We had to breath into
this product some life
that really started
to change this category
and continue to move it forward.
So, we built a laptop.
And it's beautiful.
But it's beautiful
because it's personal.
It's personal because it's meant to be
a reflection of who you are.
It brings you that security
and superior performance
that Terry talked about.
And probably most important
it's gonna last you.
And it's gonna last
that student from the day
they walk into
their orientation to the day
they walk across the stage
for their graduation.
I think this is the one
you're gonna want.
This is the Surface laptop.
- I've got chills; they're multiplying.
And I'm losing control.
'Cause the power you're supplying.
Is electrifying.
Electrifying.
You better shape up
'cause I need a friend.
And my heart is set on you.
You better shape up.
You better understand.
To my heart,
I must be true.
You're the one that I want.
The one that I want, yeah.
You're the one that I want.
You're the one that I want.
The one I need.
Oh yes indeed.
You're the one that I want,
the one that I want.
- Cool.
It's simply gorgeous.
I'm telling you, this is gorgeous.
It's such a gorgeous product.
This product is
so meticulously crafted.
When I talk about the details
of putting a TV
together with my dad,
this is unreal
what this does.
Every single part
of this product,
every detail thought through.
Every single detail.
When you look at this product,
and you put it in your hands,
you're gonna find no reference
to how any of these parts
have come together
in the product.
You won't find a screw.
You won't find anything
that leaves
a parting line across the device.
You see perfect lines.
A perfect flow of energy.
When you pull it apart
and open it seamlessly,
you see a tone in tone
balance in the colors.
In product making we have
a thing called the first read.
We talk about it in our
design labs all the time.
What's the first read
on the product?
How does it feel?
It's meant to be silent to the eyes.
That's critical.
When you look at it,
does it feel good?
Does it draw you in?
What does it mean?
Why?
How do we get people into their flow?
How do we get them moving?
It really is a product
that draws you in.
It's one of these products
where you have to feel it to understand it,
and so we'll do that.
Can I show you this device?
I want to talk about the way
we made it with you if that's cool.
Am I embarrassing you right now?
I probably am.
I mean you have lovely equipment.
I don't want to hurt it.
You don't have to move.
Stay right there.
Stay right there. No, totally cool.
You do have to move though,
so scoot in a little bit.
All right.
Cool.
All right.
This is the Surface laptop.
And this is burgundy.
You're wearing burgundy.
- I am wearing burgundy.
- I think we didn't plan this, did we?
That's pretty cool.
I want you to see it.
I want you to feel it.
I want you to kinda get
the essence of this product.
When you think of what we're trying to do
with the laptop
and where we want to push things.
We want to push things
a little bit further.
We want to move from things
that are feeling like machines,
and we want to move to something
that's more personal.
Something that's just
more personal to you.
Keep it for the show.
Show it to whoever you want.
But I think ...
Do you like it?
- I, I, I ...
- If you take a look,
we've designed the product
in four gorgeous colors.
Burgundy, graphite gold,
platinum, and cobalt blue.
All beautifully inspired
through different elements
in nature to bring it to life.
And the idea of making
something more personal
and bringing it to you was critical
in this product.
Now, when you hold this product,
it feels amazingly thin and light,
which is really important
when it comes to a laptop like this.
It's 2.76 pounds.
It's under 14-1/2 millimeters.
And with one finger
you can open the screen,
which is super cool,
but it's very elegant in the sense
that I just open it
smoothly just like that.
And what you get is a 13-1/2 inch diagonal
with a 3 by 2 aspect ratio.
This is the ...
When you think about aspect ratio
and this diagonal,
that's the productivity
of a 14-inch laptop
and your standard
16 by 9 format.
So it's like a 14-inch laptop,
but it feels and acts like a 13-inch size
when it's in your bag.
When you close it.
When you close this product,
it feels so elegant.
It's important.
It's important that it
sounds good when you close it.
'Cause when you're done
with your thought,
and you close something
don't you want closure?
Of course, you do.
Now when you look
at the products
you're using right now,
and there's a lot of them out there,
you're gonna find a rubber
bumper around the screen.
You're gonna find either a piece
of plastic around the screen.
The reason that's there is
because when you close these devices,
you don't want to break the glass.
I mean that's pretty smart.
But this elegant dance
between these two parts come together
so seamlessly in this product.
And when I say at the first read
you won't find
any misplaced parts
and every detailed matter,
there's no rubber bumper.
There's no plastic chin.
There's no hinge
that you can see.
It's all part of the device
that flows and fades
to the background.
The screen itself
is 3.4 million pixels.
3.4 million pixels.
It's that exact screen
that you would expect from Surface.
That high contrast.
That color calibrated screen.
You know what it is.
I do it every time.
I'm not gonna do it.
You know what it is.
At the end of the day,
this is the thinnest LCD
touch module ever created
and put into a laptop.
And that's how you get this form.
That's the laptop.
Of course, I'm low on time.
I gotta keep going.
Okay.
We could stay all day.
That's an option.
I want to show you the Surface Pen.
I'm a huge fan of the pen.
We talk about the pen all the time.
Of course, the pen works on this screen.
I want to show you a feature in Windows
if you haven't used it in the Creator's update,
go give it a shot.
Take a video.
Get your pen, put it to the screen,
and bring this feature to life.
I'm gonna show you the craftsmanship video
that you'll find in my blog later today.
It's about two minutes long.
This is a 30 second cut
of that just to bring it to life.
And what you can do with something.
So, students if you will, they're making
a lot of videos these days.
Even my elementary school girls
right now are doing it.
My high school son and daughter,
they're also making videos.
Either they're doing book reports,
or they're telling stories,
or they're creating.
This is happen.
That didn't happen in my time,
but it is happening now.
In the world of video creating for us,
the last video you saw we spent a lot of time
on every detail
and every second of every frame.
In this case what I'm gonna show you
is how simple communication change
with the power of the pen.
And then the emotion
that can come in with it.
I'm gonna hit play.
Watch how this will video play.
As it's playing, I'll put my pen
to the screen to send the note to a team.
And notice what happens.
And we talked about this a lot.
The power of the pen.
Don't underestimate it.
The emotion that comes with writing.
The cognitive recall that comes with writing,
but in this case, I'm just sending a message
to the team that says, "It is awesome."
"The seam here that you cannot see is awesome."
"Where the fabric and the aluminum
come together is perfect."
And I want them to feel that,
so I'm gonna send this back
to the team if you will right now.
And so I'll rewind it.
I'm gonna play it.
I want you to enjoy these 30 seconds,
so I'm gonna get out of your way.
But then I want you to see
how the ink makes it way back,
and that's such a human form
where you can collect that emotion
because it's the ink and my soul
that ends up on that screen
that you get to feel
because I wrote it with the exclamation
points and with my handwriting.
You also can kind of figure that out.
If I was mad, it looks very similar.
Okay.
Take a look at this.
- We tried to put every good ingredient
we learned from the past into Surface laptop.
Like the fabric customized
for each keyboard.
When you open you only see a piece of glass
and piece of fabric, and then keyboard.
You don't really see
the mechanical hinge.
That's the pureness.
- There is no compromise
in what we do in manufacturing.
We're suddenly bringing metal
and plastic keys and fabric together.
Our manufacturing engineers are driven
to invent processes
to make sure that ultimately
you're getting this full Surface experience.
- Now you saw when I use
the pen you should see no lag;
you should see no latency.
And the pen is really coming to life.
The performance on this device
is absolutely amazing.
Think about Windows 10 S
for just a minute
because it's so important.
You get this unbelievably
streamlined performance that lasts,
and you get this product
that starts up unbelievably quickly.
And let's just talk about
that for just a second.
When I opened the screen earlier,
you saw me open it with one finger
and the screen was just there and turned on.
And when I'm closing this screen
with its elegant close
I'm shutting down this computer
and putting it into sleep.
And then I want this product.
And what Windows 10 has done
with the engineering team
alongside the Surface team
is every single detail
had to come to life
because we cannot have students
waiting for their products.
If you're a student and you're in a lecture,
you need to capture a note.
You have to open
your product and move.
We're used to generation
when you just hit a button,
and your device is ready for you.
The technology you have is there.
Instant on is critical.
It is part of our lives.
It should be celebrated,
but actually the celebration
of instant on is
because you can capture your thought,
you can capture the moment,
you capture your creation.
And so that's what we brought
to life in this product.
That performance that's coming
right now where it's just there.
And if you're using Windows
Hello this product
will log you in,
and you're moving.
You're going right in.
That's so important.
Now, this product comes
with the latest corei5
and corei7 Intel processors.
It has up to one terabyte
if you choose PCIe SSD.
And that is integrated
directly onto the motherboard,
which in essence lowers
the power consumption
and maximizes the performance
on this device.
No one has ever integrated
a PCIe SSD that way ever before.
And it results in this engineering
effort that gets you to 14
and a half hours
of battery life on this product.
14 and a half.
This isn't about taking your charger
and pulling it out of your bag in between classes.
This is where we want to change the game.
Charge your device.
Leave your charger home
and go to school.
And then go to the library.
And then come home
and binge watch Netflix.
And then cram a little.
And then charge it.
That's so important.
But just as important
as designing the battery life
when a device is on is
designing the battery life
when the device is off.
I know that sounds kind of funny,
but the truth is some of that
promise of Windows 10 S
and Surface is just that.
When you close the lid,
and you leave for Spring Break,
and you forgot
to put the charge on.
Don't worry.
When you get back
if you're disheveled
a little bit,
you're rushing to class.
Pick it up.
Open it.
And you'll be right
where you left off.
That exact same battery
where you closed the lid will be back
when you come from Spring Break
and ready for you to go.
Isn't that awesome?
That's just cool.
Now let me put this device
in a little bit of more context,
so you get a little
more of that.
In the history of laptops
and designing a laptop,
there has always been
something that had to give.
Whether it's the weight.
Whether it's the battery life.
Whether it's the performance.
Whether it's the thinness.
Whether it's the key switch,
the travel, how it feels under your hands.
Everything was working
against each other.
If you want to push more pixels
onto a screen like this,
you probably need
more battery life
and a little bit
more performance.
If you need more battery life,
you likely need a bigger battery.
If you need a bigger battery,
you likely need a thicker device.
If you need a thicker device,
it's likely getting heavier.
And then reverse that
or put it in any order.
These are conflicting goals.
This is the first product
that brings that all together.
The team talked about
making the Surface
laptop and used the word balance.
And when we create products
we talk about it.
What is the one thing
on this product?
And it was balance.
We needed to bring
a perfectly balanced product.
A product that had never been
brought together like this before.
And a way to kind
of put it in context
is let's just talk
about other laptops
because it frames it.
Now a lot of students
use Macbook Airs
and Macbook Pros,
and we know that.
And those are awesome products.
I mean they are awesome products.
The Surface laptop itself is lighter
and thinner than any Macbook Air
or Macbook Pro
on the market right now.
It's 50% faster
than the Macbook Air.
And when you compare the corei7
Surface laptop to the corei7
13.3 inch Macbook Pro,
the Surface laptop is faster.
And all that comes
to this moment.
We have more battery life
in this product
than any Macbook on market today.
Put all that together,
and that's the Surface laptop.
We're really proud of the team.
Really proud of the team.
This is the laptop that starts
to reset the category.
I mean it is the most balanced
laptop you will ever find.
Now how did we do it?
It's worth talking about
because the innovations
on this product are hard to see.
The beauty easy
to see and feel.
The innovation hard to see
because it's disappeared.
We had to push this product
to its peak performance
while keeping the device
as thin and light as possible.
Our thermal design allows
this front edge of the product
to stay under 10 millimeters.
That was critical, critical.
Because if we're gonna bring
something beautiful to you,
keep all that performance in it,
we couldn't start trading off
any of the form of this product.
We want students to be proud
when they pull it out of their bag,
and they want to feel proud
when they do that.
We integrated vapor
chambers right ...
Shaped as heat pipes directly
into the aluminum backing.
Right underneath here.
Now I have to tell you this
because my team back in Redmond
right now is like please
just tell them.
Tell them.
You're never gonna see this,
but I'm still gonna tell you.
Right under the processor,
these pipes run, and basically,
it makes the bottom aluminum bucket
three different parts in one.
It's functional.
It's structural.
And it brings that cosmetic
perfection all at the same time.
That's not been
done before.
It allows us to pack
everything we need in here
and still give you
the weight and battery life
and thickness that you wanted.
And then we knew
how much beauty mattered
and we weren't gonna
compromise it.
And we talked about this being
a product I want you to be proud of
when you pull it
out of your bag.
We overlaid Alcantara fabric
onto the top of the keyboard.
This is a product
imported from Italy.
It's premium.
It's durable.
It stands the test of time.
But it also allowed us
to laser etch
after we optically
aligned each single key
on the product to leave no lines
on the product at all.
And to let no light
leakage come out.
So when you are
cramming late at night
like I did for this presentation,
you get the perfect light.
You get the perfect light
when you put your hands down.
But it also allows us a full one
and a half millimeter travel
on the keyboard.
It is buttery smooth,
buttery smooth.
When you put your hands
on this thing
and type you feel so good.
And why does that matter?
Because when you're
in the flow ...
Because when we have
a student immersed ...
Because when you are writing
that entrance essay,
this technology must
get out of your way.
It must.
And it has to work seamlessly.
And so when you put
this thing on your ...
your hands on top of this
keyboard it feels warm.
It doesn't feel cold.
It invites you in.
It invites you in.
Now the fabric has just
a bit more than just form
It has some amazing function.
If you look at this product,
you'll see no speaker grills.
You'll see no speaker holes.
And it gives that perfect look
when we talk about
that first read and how soft.
We were able to invent
a technology
to integrate the speakers
underneath the keyboard,
use the fabric
to push the sound through,
and then push it out the keys.
To point it right at you
as you're creating.
It's incredible.
That's insane, right?
I know it's crazy.
And now the sounds coming
at you while you're working.
So if you're editing that video
and you want to be immersed
and you the sound
and the visuals to come together
as creators know
which are so, so important.
This is the product
that brings that to life.
Now I want to share
with you a little bit
about Microsoft Office
and Surface and Windows
coming together.
Office, my favorite product
on the planet.
I use it every day, Word especially,
and I want to show you
how the dial integrates into this
Surface laptop really quick
and give you some function
of the product.
Let me give you
my set up really quick.
This is the Surface laptop.
I'm using the Surface
docking station.
This product has
all the ports you need,
and I'm sure the ports
you're gonna want.
But here we're connected
with a Surface docking station.
So if you're not a student,
let's just say you're a professional.
You already have a Surface
and a docking station.
It works seamlessly together.
This is a great product
if you're taking it home or for work.
But in the sense of student's,
this is the Word document.
We know students love Word.
We know they use it.
We know they create ...
I create in Word and read in Word.
But watch as I move
the dial with my hand.
What you'll find is
we're gonna integrate
the smoothness of this dial
to the product itself,
which was an important element.
So as I move left
and I move right,
you see that integration
of the UI of Office.
And this is that design
that's so important between Office
and Surface to get perfect because we want
these things to flow seamlessly.
And when we demoed this on
Studio you say that same elegant piece.
I want to show you
one more application
that brings this product to life.
And it's a very cool app, for sure.
Before I do that, let's talk.
Windows 10 S, Office,
and Surface.
These are all products
that were made for each other.
But the key is they were
actually made with each other.
Every single document you will use
on this will be protected and secured.
Every single app you use
is verified by Microsoft,
which streamlines you for security
and superior performance.
And if you need an app
that's not in the store, that's fine.
You can just go
and download Windows Pro
and use any app you want.
Now that last application
I want to talk about
is probably the application
that brings it
together for me.
Now 3D 4 Medical
is this company.
Amazing company
doing amazing work
for students and teachers
around the world.
And they launched Complete Anatomy
in our store just this year.
And it really is the product
that I get to show you today
to highlight all the performance
in this device.
To show you how the dial,
the pen, the touch,
the vibrant screen
all comes together
in just a beautiful,
elegant application.
And it all designs
specifically for the Surface
to come to life.
I want to invite my good friend, Edel,
out here from 3D 4 Medical,
and she's gonna show you
a little bit more about this product.
Edel, come on out.
Have fun.
- Thank you.
- Have fun.
- Hi, I'm Edel from 3D 4 Medical.
When I studied neuroscience,
all I had were flat 2D images
in textbooks to study
the anatomy of the human brain.
I remember spending ages
looking online hoping
to find a better visual resource,
but it just didn't exist.
At 3D 4 Medical
we have a vision.
And that is to transform
medical learning.
I'm real excited to be
part this revolution
and to show you how using
Complete Anatomy on the new
Surface laptop creates a totally new
and immersive experience
for students.
On this screen, you'll see
the human skeletal model in 3D.
And the power of this laptop means
that I can easily navigate
the model without any lag.
The textures and the anatomical accuracy
can be displayed
in immersive
detail no matter
how far I zoom in.
I love this product
because it allows users
to explore over 6,500 structures
right at our fingertips.
And as we are visual learners,
simply scanning this model
means that users
retain more information
than they would from a flat 2D
image in a textbook.
The Surface style allows me
to interact with the model.
For example, I can choose
to fade surrounding structures.
And now I can see
where this complex bone sits
in the middle of the skull.
I can explode this region
and see the relationship
between anatomical structures.
Using the dial,
I can fully control
the movement of these structures.
You can't do this
with a textbook.
Now let's relate
the anatomy to function,
which students find very
difficult to visualize.
I can turn on the muscles
and see what movement
the muscles carry out.
This is the actual model
moving here in real time.
And I can control this body
movement using the dial.
I am making the neck
bend here using the dial,
and I can view this motion at any angle.
This is a whole new level
of exploration,
and it's not just
applicable to anatomists.
It's interesting for me
as a sports enthusiast
to see how the muscles
work in the body.
Using this 3D technology,
users can completely
immerse themselves in learning
about the human body.
We can go even further
and modify the actual 3D structures.
Using the Surface Pen,
I can cut through
various layers
and structures
such as the skin,
the fat, muscles, bone,
and even the meninges
covering the brain.
And now I can identify
different parts of the brain
and study their related functions.
I can also draw
directly onto the model.
Now I will always remember
that this part of the brain
is associated with motor function
because I have written it
directly onto this cortex.
And now I have
an interactive screen
that I have created in seconds.
I can share what I have
created via the cloud
with my study group and friends.
3D 4 Medical's technology together
with the new Surface laptop replaces
the needs for dozens
of flat 2D textbooks.
Transforming medical learning
by propelling
a century's old way of studying
anatomy into the 21st century.
Thank you.

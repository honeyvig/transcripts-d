foreign
and welcome back to another video by
simply learn this is anubhub and in this
video we will create a real-time chat
application using websocket and socket
IO Library which is the powerful library
of nodes we will also use HTML CSS and
JavaScript so let's begin but before
that if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and press the Bell icon
so you will get all the updates from
Simply learn so the expert at anything
was once a beginner so to become an
expert it is very important to have a
solid foundation to achieve this
learning new things and implementing
them is the only way so now I have got
you an amazing program by simply learn
if you want to become a software
developer consider this Kel Tech
postgraduate program in full stack web
development by simply learned and master
those necessary skills check out the
link in the description for more details
you can also call on the numbers that
are given below to know more about the
program and they will guide you so do
check it out now let's jump right into
our video first we'll create a program
so for that I'll open my visual studio
code
and from here I'll go to the terminal so
I'll press Ctrl back text for the
terminal
and inside this I'll create
a directory or my folder name
so for that I'll write mktir and let's
name it as well it's chat box
okay so this folder has been created so
I'll go to that folder
chat box okay
now what I'll do is I'll just write
npm
in it
okay in it slash y
so from here until it gets installed so
okay so let's open our folder and open
the folder it must be inside the
C drive users and here I'll find my chat
box
so this one is the chat box select
folder and then open the folder for you
so as you can see one Json file has been
created with the help of this terminal
that we wrote in per minute okay
so let's move ahead
let's create a folder inside this chat
box and name it as public okay
inside this public I'll create one
Javascript file let's name it as
client.js
and then one CSS file let's name it as
style dot CSS okay now in my root
directory
I'll create one file and name it as
index dot HTML okay
so this is how the structure is looking
right now okay
so here I'll write
the basic HTML code
okay which is also known as Boiler code
here I'll write
chat box
okay let's save it and we'll also add
the
CSS for that I'll write
link
print rail
Style
sheet
and then
inside this I'll show him the directory
so inside the public folder my file is
this one okay
yeah so let's close this one and inside
the body tag
I'll give
the JavaScript script
source
inside the source will give the
directory for the JavaScript
so
yeah
it's looking all good
now we'll install npm for that I will
write npm
install
we can also write I
and then Express
enter and let's wait a couple of seconds
until it gets installed okay it's
installed but I'll tell you what node.js
is so naughtiest is an open source cross
platform server side JavaScript runtime
environment that allows developer to
build scalable Network applications
it uses an event-driven non-blocking
input output model which makes it highly
efficient and perfect for real-time data
intensive applications
okay so I'll tell you more about socket
IO now socket IO is a library for
node.js that enables real-time
bi-directional communication between
client and server over a single
websocket connection
it allows developer to create real-time
chat applications such as chat systems
online games and collaborative editing
tools that can handle a large number of
simultaneous connections
socket i o abstracts away the
underlining websocket implementation and
provides a simple API that allows
developer to work with events when a
client connects to a server using socket
i o it can listen to and emit events
which are essentially messages that can
contain any type of data the server can
also listen and emit events enabling
bi-directional communication between the
client and server okay
so let's now
install node mode in our system
for that I'll write npm
so until it gets installed I'll tell you
about the node mode is a package which
helps us to not again and again go to
terminal and then run our application
when you install node mode in our system
it will automatically regenerate the
output for us on the server okay we
don't have to whenever we save the file
we'll just reload the page
let's move ahead now
now
what we'll do is we'll create a file in
our root directory and let's name it as
server dot Js
okay inside the server.js you will
connect
all the packages okay so I'll write
const
Express
require
I'll write Express
so it can fetch the express
app
press function
and then
create
give it a port
so what this line will do is
so it will when we will deploy our
project
it will take us directly to the portal
okay
three thousand now we'll take another
module which is HTTP for that will again
write const
http
require
let's check the spelling also because I
make so many mistakes in spelling
okay
so let's write here create server on app
okay we also have to call it so for that
we will write a function here
http
Dot listen
we'll give it a port that we just
created okay
again I will give the function with a
fat row
and then I'll tell him to console
log
and listen
it's a battery guys okay
listening
together
but we can also report
and then dollar sign remember guys
dollar sign and inside this we'll write
Port so so that it can fetch the data
inside this port
okay
now let's save it
and
let's create a route also now only
app dot get request will take and then
request
and response okay and response
and we'll also write a texture so we can
check
whether it's working or not so we'll
send a response
and set this I'll write
hello
save it
let's save the html2
that's fine let's now
little thing the test and let's write a
script here
development server
and inside this still inside
[Music]
right server
yeah everything looks good now
okay
also after the license
will give it some
dependencies
it's installed but I don't know why it's
not showing here
so let's write here Express
it was installed
yeah
the spelling is correct
yeah
okay now we'll install another one
there's
dependencies
and inside that I will write
node on
okay
and after that I'm like
which one I want to use that's where I
want to use
let's save it
and inside this I'll write let's
currently this terminal and create new
one
let's hear it
npm run indep
as it is showing
listening on port number 3000 okay
that we have created on the
server.js right
now let's go to our
enter or let's see up
here I'll write
local numbers three thousand
let's refresh it it's not
you can also
okay
or three thousand
and it's not working on the localhost so
what we do is we check for the issue
I've removed this response send line and
pasted this one in which I am sending a
file this HTML file in the directory
name plus
index.html so I'll go to HTML and here
in the body I'll write
H1 tag
inside
I'll let hello from
here
let's save it and let's check
okay yeah it is clearly showing us hello
from Simply learn
s five
probably
so let's go
and here everything looks good but now
we don't need this line
we have to create a full-fledged UI
first for this for that I'll write
section
and then give it a glass of chat
section
here
inside this
I'm gonna write another div class
that's right
code
inside this code I'm gonna write
add a image source
in the source of the image I'll write in
a while
altered text we can
labeled as black also okay
so in this one I'll write an H1
chat
okay so chat box here
so let me add one picture in this public
folder I'll be back
okay so I have added one chat dot PNG
file so let me add it in the image
source for that it's inside the public
and
the file name is
chat.png let's save it
so this is how it's looking right now
but we'll change it and make it a cool
UI and then we'll integrate the chat
application okay
so let's create a
Dev class after this
we will create a div
like the chart section now we'll create
a message section
for that I'll create message
section
then
we can also write
message area
the section should be
one section
for the cover I'm more part of the skin
so
now we'll create another div inside this
let's give it a meme as
last name as
will come in
messages
as you can see on the WhatsApp Facebook
or any uh chatting application they have
two sites in one side in the right side
you will see your messages are going and
on the left side other person or people
messages are coming so this is how
will create uh two sides in which one is
incoming messages which will come from
your friends family members or anyone or
in one side you will send them a message
it will create in a while for outgoing
messages okay
so inside this for now we'll write H4
okay
write a junk data for now
okay
I'll copy this incoming there and paste
it here
and let's change the name of incoming to
out
so here I'm meeting the name to
okay let's save this one
yeah
so
let's open our page and see whether it's
working yeah
completely okay fine
okay now what we'll do is after this
outgoing we'll create another there
okay
further thank you stevia
so I'll write text India
inside this let's take a name as
or ID
and class are very different ID is what
which will use only once we cannot use
it again again the class we create one
class and we want to use it anywhere
else we can use it right and ID can't be
changed but class we can change
so I'll write I'll read text area
or calls let's give it a 30
row also
columns rows
same thing
okay let's give it a 10
them let's close this section
so create one section with
this is the section closing tag
it's not closing anywhere yeah
let's close this section yes
okay and let's give it a placeholder
also for this text so placeholder is
worthy that you will see inside a text
box okay
I'll write
write something
let's save it
check yeah
everything is then yeah and solving
completely fine
now
let's move ahead
two styles
so to save time I'll copy paste this CSS
file from my
file and let's wait a couple of seconds
so now I have copied my CSS file and
pasted it so this is the font size that
I'm copying from Google so this star is
indicated that this pending and all are
for the whole bit and then I'm giving
some legs walk justify content and all
to Center in the body section after that
the chart section comes up I'm giving it
a 100 100 800 pixels of it match width
for 90 this is for what uh to make this
app as a responsive so whenever I'll
click on the
the what uh phone it will open the
screen as a phone
let's move ahead see this is what uh
that upper one with logo and chat box
and then message area and all this is
very simple okay
so now let's go back to our index and
save it
and let's check it
so this is how our application is
looking right now okay
the image is very big we can easily
decrease the size of this image by just
writing
hide
I will write 14.
Let's see we didn't check yeah
so this is how our application is
looking right now isn't it looking
awesome yeah yeah we'll add the
functionalities with the help of node.js
don't worry about that but this is how
it's looking right now
you can also add some more text messages
now what we'll do is
we will add some more messages here
so for that let's add
copy
this
okay
this collage component
paste it sometimes
okay
and as you can see there is one scroller
coming up
right
yeah
they have application is looking right
now
great
okay so the scroller is here now
now what we'll do is
we'll move ahead
now everything is looking perfect now
what will we do is we'll install socket
IO
terminal and I'll press Ctrl C
it will tell me whether you want to
close it or not so here
I'll add a command nbm install
kit
dot IO and let's press enter and wait
couple of seconds until it install the
powerful socket IO for us so it's done
now let's write here npm
run Dev
okay
now
let's go to the server file
and here
I will comment first and write socket
don't worry about the code I'll give you
the code in the description box
okay
so
let's import this first const IO
require
socket IO
but I would should come under
and this is okay
now
in this we have to pass a server that
which server that we need okay
so let's
ride
http
no
no let's give a connection between them
connection
and after that
socket
and connect the connection with the
socket
Arrow function
then let's here we'll write console
DOT log
and here we'll write
connected
yeah
so
let's
save it
now the socket i o setup with server.js
is done
so next step would be to
get the
mixing here so here we'll write script
Dot
okay inside this script I'll give it a
source of socket
dot IO
slash
socket
dot IO dot Js
okay
so this client Library will load here
so let's write here in the client load
const
socket
this i o is coming from the
client Library
and let's save it
and let's here
refresh
okay
yeah it's working completely fine
let's move ahead
okay
yes
now we're going to start creating this
amazing feature now to prompt okay so
whenever I any user will come to this
website it will the first thing that
will pop up here is a prompt message
which will tell the user you will tell
me about your name then he or she will
tell the name and then that name will be
fixed for that one user
so let's see how to create that okay so
inside the client
will do the
knee
so let's give it a name
and then let's use two while loop
here I'll write while
right
and here I'll write
prompt
and let's first save this prompt in a
name
okay
so this is how
please enter
your name
Okay so until in the while
we will write
name
so it's
checking the line here okay
fine
yeah let's save it
so until the user gives its name
then only it will work
okay
here we'll write
[Music]
and then we'll take the text area
whenever we write something we want to
send the message
okay for that we are writing this part
when we selected inside that
will write
that's big Stadium
okay
now after this do value
I'll just write the text area
add event listener
we will pass a key here we will name it
as key up
and then one element
okay
and then we'll check
whether we have entered the press the
entered key or not okay
this is what enter dot key
then only
enter
okay
so we will send us send
message
things like that e dot Target dot value
right
now
will create a function inside this we'll
see how to send the message the logic
will be inside this this function okay
let's create a new variable
or message and then
comma message
okay inside this message I'm gonna write
message this medium is I'm confused
about let me just check
now
we will add I will see you what's the
problem in it but let's check it after
some time
so we'll write message
a pen message inside that I'll write a
message
and then the outgoing string
okay
now we'll create a function for this
append
okay first we'll leave to
check the append message
okay so what we're doing here is
we'll create a function
to append message
and type that I'm gonna write the
message and then the type of the message
like outgoing one incoming
right
and inside that I'm gonna write
now before writing the function we'll
import the message area file for that we
will go to this here
and here I'm gonna add one another
okay
it's right here lead
message
document
dot query selector
and inside that query query the selector
will write
the message
area
okay
so coming back to the mean function that
you were writing so here we'll write
lead
ER okay
I'll write
document
document
it's not document type let's write a
document only document
create event
create element inside that element we
are going to call third depth
string
okay
the last name
here we are writing the type only
because here we can know it's an
incoming or outgoing message so we are
just writing the type it will again
editor the mean there's
but
so let's
add the class limit
test will add and inside that will add
class name
we will add
message
read
now we will tell him to mark
and then
Markham
okay
so what we'll do is
we will try it
it's for
inside that we will write
because let's take this one down and
then here right
H4
inside there is we'll call the message
user right
so for that we'll write
message Dot
user
right
and after that
I'll create one paragraph
inside that when whatever message the
user will write
that will come inside this message
Dot
okay
let's close this one also
and let's save it
okay
now what we'll be doing here is let's
write mainly
dot enter HTML equals to
drop
right
now we have to appendages right
message area dot a print child
that we just created with the help of
JavaScript
right
now
let's save it
now it will do where is
and now let's go back to the HTML file
and now
we want this
now let's delete the messages because
from now this message is Will
directly
import inside this div right
so let's save it
and check
okay
so I think it's not working well
let's open the inspect
issue with any okay
it's giving me an error let's find out
what's the error if I need to resolve
this over with the status or one of them
okay
something to preview in the scripts this
socket.io.js file is not there
let's find out
this solid red script
and find out there
okay we can change that one but don't
worry
so this is how our UI is looking
isn't it awesome now I'll type a message
let's see
how are you
okay now I'm saying I'm gonna send it
now as you can see it's typing correctly
this is how our chat GPT works now I'll
add one text from this number from that
side from my code okay so what I'll do
here is I'll copy this incoming message
and inside this I'm gonna write
paste here I'll write
hello
let's check yeah it's coming in the that
side so we'll change the
paste it here
right so here I'll write
I'm good
good
how are you
okay let's save it and stick yeah it's
completely working fine tell me I'm
gonna write now okay I'm good how are
you
please
do
simply learn
to
okay
now I'll send it
it's saying please subscribe to Simply
learn YouTube channel
right isn't it looking amazing so this
is how we created our chat box using
socket IO okay
so
with this we have D the end of this
video
so we hope you had a lot to learn and if
you have any suggestions or doubt please
write them down in the comment section
below thank you so much for tuning in
today and happy learning and the source
code will be in the description box

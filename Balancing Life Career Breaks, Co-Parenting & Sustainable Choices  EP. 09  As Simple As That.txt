[Music]
and my mom was expecting the third one
and there was born again another girl my
dad had a fever that night both my me
and my wife were very very disappointed
and we couldn't come out of the shock so
that my younger son had hair till he
became 6-year-old there are lots of
women taking break mainly for child care
yeah yeah and right after that they
probably lose the confidence because we
didn't get the right kind of education
about how to treat your trash so we go
into the school we train 10 children and
these 10 children are called Eco
Commandos okay and any child who's
bringing plastic is called an Eco
Warrior okay like I'll tell you in my
case when my first son was born I had
taken a career break for 18 months and
my wife was amazing there should be a
loss in that you can't if you're
educated you can't sit at home stories
well that's what most of us have heard
others tell that's what we have probably
heard too growing up well what makes a
great story maybe it's not that complex
a simple story with little incidents
failures roadblocks and those tiny
Milestone that need to be celebrated
maybe it's as simple as that join me on
this journey as I share uncommon stories
of common people right here with you
keeping in line with the theme of
showcasing uncommon stories of common
people today we have a very special
guest a learner Gita who did one of our
certifications what makes Gita story
special well it's one that every woman
who wears multiple Hearts will resonate
with I'm not sure what title best fits
her a business analyst an entrepreneur
an environmentalist a mom a daughter or
an inspiration to many I let you decide
so welcome to as simple as that Gita
let's start with a quick introduction so
help us understand your personal as well
as professional background thanks
Krishna um I'm so humbled to be even
meeting you today um and uh it's it's
amazing the kind of Institute you've
created for people and I can't tell you
the kind of Advantage people like myself
are gaining from it moving into the
question that you've just asked about
personal life and professional life on
the personal front um I'm married and I
have two kids and uh being a mom is
always a challenge when it comes to
being a working mom so on the
professional front right now I'm working
as a project manager in absolute Labs um
I've had about 16 years of experience um
I've been in the UK for about 12 years
and worked there as well and yeah right
now I'm I'm here working with absolute
Labs from the past close to one year now
yeah so thanks G for the kind words and
great to know that you benefited from
Simply learn platform let's start with
your early Journey so when you completed
your education how did you get your
first job and how was that Journey for
before marriage after marriage how did
you go to UK help us get little bit Peck
into that uh last 16 years of your
journey yeah thank you thanks for
getting into the kind of History it um
it feels nice to always share that story
uh I did my mtech with uh myour and uh
once I did my first year you know and I
was in my project in the second year I
started applying I think every
Engineering Graduate will identify with
the fact that as soon as they reach the
final year they they get the butterflies
in their tumy that yeah I need to get
into a job so the same happened with me
and I started taking a lot of walk-ins
and uh things like that um and I got
into Oracle Oracle cop first uh it was a
whole day uh wor of you know interviews
and uh many multiple rounds of it uh
once I got into Oracle I worked there
for quite some about 2 years or so um
and by then um I decided to go to the UK
uh which is where uh my hubby was
already uh I hadn't got married as as
yet and once um I went to the UK you
know I I started working there in the UK
because of the professional experience I
had out of Oracle okay it wasn't very
difficult and that wasn't 2008 you must
remember the economic slump that
happened at that time right but like you
said you know there is a whole different
face before marriage after marriage and
after kids for a woman uh so as you can
imagine I did take a break for my uh
first daughter and then I did take a
break for my son as well um but uh I
have a feeling that you know when you
take a break for after child birth is a
lot more acceptable inves countries than
it is in India um and uh so I felt a lot
more comfortable taking breaks in
between my career there in UK you grew
up in Bangalore right and also saw that
your father was the professor of Ms Raya
Institute which is one of the most
popular engineering school here in
Bangalore so how was it doing
engineering from an Institute where your
father is a professor or I think he was
a principal also right he was the
principal and it it was like a typical
three idiots kind of a story it's it's
very humbling to be in the same
Institute that your dad is working and
um there is a pressure as well uh but I
think um being a part of such a great
Institute is is always going to be
behind you because even now when um in
absolute Labs during my interview the
question came up in what which Institute
did you pass out of and when I said it's
msrit it was recognized so um being in
Premier institutes really matters I also
heard about that your three siblings and
you the youngest of all and it was a
very different experience for your
father who was expecting a boy than a
girl and so I'm sure what was the exper
like his thought process then and how he
looks at it today yes uh thanks for
asking this question Krishna I think um
the attitude Still Remains in the
society that there has to be a boy in
the house and you can imagine the
pressure back then like 30 40 years back
um my my parents already had two two
daughters and my mom was expecting the
third one and there was born again
another girl my dad had a fever that
night he's like oh because always girls
were looked at their like a
liability uh but very fortunately my dad
he moved out of the village he did his
mtech in a city within Andra Pradesh uh
in one of the top universities and then
from there on he applied in Bangalore
msrit and he got through through tough
competition I'm so glad he took that
step once he got a job here and we came
down to here uh things were very
different so I can tell you g that
things have changed for sure I'll tell
you my own story that we had our second
kid as son both my me and my wife were
very very disappointed and we couldn't
come out of the shock so that my younger
son had long hairs till he became 6year
old and people couldn't differentiate
whether he was a boy or a girl because
he had a very cute face and a long hair
so everybody used to think that there's
a girl right that's that's a very good
shift in mindset Krishna but I can tell
and relate all through my life the
number of times I've been asked oh
there's no boy in the house is there no
son in the house so my answer would
always be is it necessary and like you
asked you know what's his um what's my
my dad's feeling right now is they feel
so much more cared for by three
daughters because if not me my sisters
we are all bouncing off each other to
make sure my parents are always
comfortable so coming back to your
professional Journey so one thing that I
want to ask from you and that's
something that I find is unusual so when
it comes to Simply run platform it's
very common we see people who have one
year of experience two years of
experience generally little less number
of years of experience they are the ones
who are are the biggest audience that
comes to us because they know what they
working on and they could see some of
their friends and seniors from their
college growing faster in their care
in a in certain areas like for example
AI is hard we see a lot of people trying
to learn AI who are otherwise
programmers and they want to get into
the field of AI data science and so onh
and what we have seen is that once
people have 10 plus years of experience
they generally try to give up they think
that nothing can happen particularly in
women they once they have taken career
break especially in India there is is
extremely difficult for them to come
back so what motivated you like what
made you decide that okay I can still
come back to the work in spite of all
this break and again have a very good
career going forward the first question
is why would people slack down after
like 10 years of work experience so um
after like 10 years of work experience
people have a laccal approach towards
the profession they think yeah we've
learned enough now probably we don't
need any anymore U but things are
changing so quick everybody who's not on
the learning path is in danger yeah
either you're in the learning path or
you're in the path where there is no
nowhere to go forward uh and I think um
keeping ourself up to date with what's
coming up being there doing that is very
necessary otherwise it's very quick to
see our Junior surpasses y when we speak
about uh break you know there are lots
of women taking break mainly for child
care yeah yeah and right after that they
probably lose the confidence to be able
to you know up upskill themselves to go
there and they they they don't even know
there are avenues like simply learn in
which they can do um um courses that
will Pro probably propel them to the
professional level they want to get to I
think women and other people who are on
breaks or who want to change the
professions as well can take
advantage but I have to tell tell you
that the industry is also not very
welcoming they get discouraged but they
get discouraged up to the point that
they want to give up yeah I would say
that you know it's okay to get
discouraged but don't give up yeah keep
trying if you aim at this guy you land
up on the top of the tree so that's my
attitude as well um and when it comes to
my break I wasn't on a typical break as
such yeah I I took a break to experiment
different things
so I had about
14 12 13 years of experience by then and
I wanted to make a social change I
wanted to see if I can so I started with
my daughter's podcast she was um about
uh 8 when we started and she got an
American uh uh award as well for it so
in just about one and a half two years
um the kind of educative experience she
received out of the whole podcasting
experience is something that no you
University can give and what kind of
podcasting was this is very fascinating
talking about certain topics certain
kind of individuals tell us more about
that yes so the name of her podcast was
little mind chats okay the punchline
being minds are little not our thoughts
and She interviewed about uh 60 odd
people from across the world okay and uh
we we planned it in such a way that we
had Seasons so the first season was
health for children okay the second one
was what about education so we literally
got educationist inside and she's like
why do you give us homework so she was
able to ask those kind of questions and
then we had space we had Earth and
environment uh Sports this is very
fascinating is she continuing with that
no she isn't that sounds very good at of
course kids have opinion about a few
things and having a story yeah yeah I
mean um one thing I've realized is
children grow up and the interests move
on yeah yeah so as long as she was
interested in it I was able to produce
about 130 different episodes um so I was
her Chief editor and momer I should say
so she she got the skill of reading
through very quickly and being able to
comprehend what they're speaking and
question them back yeah and uh she
actually surprised quite a few people
around the world she even interviewed
the defense secretary of India wow yeah
so yeah when I took the break you know I
didn't want to waste my time I wanted to
deviate my skill in such a way I
upskilled myself to audio editing video
editing uh marketing uh poster making
everything and um post that while we
were in the in environment uh season of
hers we met quite a few very eminent uh
um scientists and because of what they
were saying it was quite evident that
all of us have to take that first step
to last step responsibility in what
we're doing on Earth yeah
and uh that gave birth to my
environmental um NGO which is called
little wise where wise stands for
warriors inspiring sustainable Earth and
through this uh you know NGO we are not
just educating children catch them young
now we are our trend is so irresponsible
I I wouldn't hesitate to call it IR
responsible because we didn't get the
right kind of education about how to
treat your trash
yeah and if we caught the children young
now and we gave them a platform to
express the love for Mother Earth to
learn new things about how to keep a
better environment how to treat
themselves better and the Earth better
um I think they will grow up to become
more individual uh better individuals
and so we created um I I deviced a
software I got it developed uh and the
website is now able to um register in
Eco Warriors okay and when Eco Warriors
bring in plastic they get points very
interesting okay yes so I've gamified it
for children so what they're actually
doing on the ground you will see it
reflect uh software based and they're
able to uh redeem their points to buy
something sustainable on Brown living.in
because so far we've been able to
collect close to 3 metric tons W and now
we're moving into E-Waste and there is a
good scope for us to go into collecting
used clothes now all of these are huge
pollutants on Earth yeah yeah so we're
not just doing a lot of uh tangible
effort on on the environment we're also
educating them parall and we're also
gamifying it so tell me like you talked
about your like kid podcast and there
such a great idea and you learned the
entire like skills that are required to
make a podcast and go live so you always
had this learning agility that I always
trying to learn something U all the time
so I'm not surprised that you are doing
some certification because if you can
figure it out the entire thing by by
your own editing to publishing to
marketing I'm sure you can acquire any
any certification easily help me
understand how do you manage your time
because you spoke about your NGO you
have two kids you're also working on a
full-time job and then you have parents
I'm sure you're spending some time with
your parents also so how do you go about
allocating your
time um I should say I do a lot of
things ad hoc but I do make sure I'm
addressing each one uh in chunks uh when
I'm working I don't do any other stuff
because I don't do Moonlighting sort of
stuff I have to work as a professional I
I CED that time to that whole time for
my work but besides that as you know
when we look back at what we do the
entire day there's so much of time we
actually waste and whether it's on reals
or just sitting there and laying down L
back I I try and use like 10 10 minutes
slots I literally put a 10 minute alarm
and I say okay in these 10 minutes I'll
just do something different I either
read a few pages of book or I do
something else or a new skill or learn
about a particular topic and uh that has
definitely helped me so when do you work
for your NGO is it during the weekend or
how how yes it is only during weekend
and it's like volunteer late so a lot of
volunteers are supporting you um that
that's another interesting thing I knew
I'm not very good at attracting
volunteers so we actually train 10
children within the school okay so we go
into the school we train 10 children and
these 10 children are called Eco
Commandos okay and any child who's
bringing plastic is called an Eco
Warrior okay so these 10 children always
surprise the school parents and me as
well and how good they are in executing
what they're asked to so they welcome
the parents they weigh the plastic they
they keep the plastic away so it's all
very neatly laid out each one is given a
fixed role and uh we conduct uh these
plastic collection drives just for like
three hours especially during uh parent
teacher meeting okay so that parents are
not burdened to keep coming to the
school either and uh there they're
working brilliantly just on August 3rd
we collected 173 kilos of plastic in 3
hours so so generally these drives are
at the school campus yes only in the
school campus uh so I've deviced it in
such a way that because people need to
come down and get the points as well
right so it has to be weight the kind of
plastic that bringing in so anytime you
come to me I can tell you that this
child has made this kind of progress in
helping the environment got it got so
coming back to your job search so you
had a break and you took a course and
you also had a good uh like Institute
name on your resume from where you
graduated so when you started looking
out for a job after this break how do
you see the what was given WT is your
your like actual work experience your
certifications or they look at this that
you are investing in your learning
something new how was your experience
you you've actually hit the uh nail uh
in the right point because um after a
break it can be very intimidating to go
out there and put your stuff out there I
myself you know despite having so many
years of experience I took some uh
professional help in um making sure my
CV is uh presentable enough but before
that I made sure I took the
certification from Simply learn because
I didn't want to apply for a particular
position without having the confidence
that I'm eligible to take it up okay
yeah and certifications kind of put you
to a point where you can convince
yourself and the person looking at your
CV that yeah you can do the job sorts so
uh that that's one reason why I got in I
mean I got into simply learn um
certification pspo but uh why I simply
learn is because my sister who's a
manager in another she she she worked as
a director as well and uh she said she
did her PMP certification from Simply
learn she said don't don't worry I know
I know this guy and then she gave me the
number of um I can't remember one of
your representatives and then I called
him and he kind of he was very good at
explaining what what is needed and I had
a few doubts whether it is whether it
has to be psbo or something else and uh
he got the right people with the right
information to help me make the right
decision and uh it happened pretty
quickly and during the course as well I
it gave me the confidence when when the
instructor was asking questions due to
my previous experience I was able to
answer now that kind of interaction
brings back the confidence within
ourself that though you're not in a
corporate job you can you know now you
you still have those skills within
yourself and this certification is going
to give you that extra
leverage so it's kind of reinforced your
confidence you're always confident but
it kind of gives a more validation that
I can still do it so tell me like there
are a lot of ladies who who are in
similar position they they're excellent
at they work great academic credential
but once they are into like raising kids
and have taken break somehow they find
it very difficult to come out so what
will be your advice to them I mean I I
might sound a bit uh you know snobbish
if I said this but then women are
uh especially in
India women are under definite um Family
pressure I know a lot of people or a lot
of women who have not taken career break
out of their own will but because they
were forced to yeah oh kids are too
young you need to take a break the kid
is not well you need to be with them so
the very thought of getting back to work
becs like a huge challenge yeah but then
there is a point when your children are
grown up they're going to full-time
school and you're at home doing nothing
up up until 5:00 or something and then
suddenly they realize that hey I've I'm
a graduate I'm a rankholder I should be
doing something more valuable with my
time and unfortunately the society is is
set up in such a way that everything is
skewed towards money anybody who's
earning anybody who's you know uh
financially independent is a lot more
valued yeah so naturally women are
losing out not just on the confidence or
they're losing out on the economic
exposure or what they can do with their
lives yeah uh all in the name of family
um I'm not saying that's a bad thing at
all but I'm saying there's definitely a
balance you can strike but do you think
that it's more uh like um self
acceptance like for example when I I see
a lot of cases where women say that okay
they have taken a backseat because
because they had more family
responsibility many times I think that
this is like something that they self
selected like for example let's say
there's a kid who is not keeping well
why can't the husband
go this a fair question to ask so the
ladies have to ask that question many of
the times I think that they take it on
them themselves that okay it's not
something open for discussion right
exactly exactly so women are conditioned
yeah to such an extent that now they
think that yeah this is me who are you
to tell me not take
yeah so it they've been conditioned ever
since the childhood but that's changing
you know now that there are enough
children in the city uh or in anywhere
where they're seeing their mom's working
they know that Mom is not available all
the time it can be Mom or Dad yeah yeah
and that that's definitely shifting
right now and that is where the struggle
comes in as well I think there are a lot
of story like I'll tell you in my case
when my first son was born I had taken a
career break for 18 months and my wife
was working that's amazing that that's
very inspiring to be honest and coming
from some someone like you I think
fathers should listen to something like
that and it it's it's not an obligation
that only a man should work and a woman
should be care caretaker of the house
it's got to be a that's that's what is
happening in my house right now the
though I'm into a career you know when
my husband has a meeting and I'm free I
take care of the I take care of the
household chores and if when I have a
meeting and he's free he's okay to go
pick up the kids and do do the other
things so it as long as we have that
nature of bouncing off each other's you
know free time and whatever um it is
workable definitely and coming back to
the question on what what is this what
are the choices women have who are
looking at coming back to work and are
struggling with that decision I would
say you know even if you're 60 even if
you're 70 you can look out for some work
if it's not for it's not for proving
some point it is for keeping yourself
more occupied I have a personal belief
that as a country we can never become a
developed country if ladies do not start
working our current ratio of female
participation in Workforce is so bad
that it is worse than what it used to be
in ' 80s and you know why because in '
8s there are lot of like this manual
labor people who are poor husband and
wife both work you can notice that like
look at all your housemates look at all
the construction workers they can't
afford to have only one guy working and
feeding their kids so both of them work
ex it is we had more such workers in our
society so our overall female
participation in Workforce was higher
than it is today today it is lower
because there are lot of this Fe ladies
who think that their husbands are
working well enough why should they work
there should be law say that you can't
if you're educated you can't sit at home
if there was way right because this is
the only way for us to make our economy
grow that law comes out I want another
appending law um along with it which
says that
men should not decide a woman's career
yes like I have seen in simply a lot of
ladies like there was a girl who worked
with us for almost 12 years she recently
left I remember 6 years back she setted
she had a baby and the husband wanted
her to leave the job she and she told me
out out of like such saying that my
husband told me that okay you need to
leave your job because baby is Young and
I told him told him back that I leave
you but I'll not leave my kid nor I
leave my job so is there any childhood
memory that that you remember that
really helped you like get a better
understanding of your own personality
something that really kind of jolted you
to become something else from what we
were like anything that you can remember
I used to fail in quite a few my few of
my subjects up until the sixth standard
uh so during my transition between 6th
and 7th I I'm really not sure what
happened but something snapped inside
and I'm like come on I'm done with I'm
done with being P off always in the
school I need to do something about this
and um so I just went to my parents and
I said I want to start tution in my
summer holidays so that I'm more
prepared for my seventh standard and my
parents like you know they were they
were shocked is this girl okay sorts and
still yeah they said okay fine let's put
you in the tution and that tution
teacher had really huge eyes and her
eyes were enough to discipline the the
kids around and um I got like bloody hit
by her so many times by the scale but at
that point I thought I have to take this
you know I need to get rid of that kind
of laziness and my my theory worked that
if I'm prepared over the summer holidays
my seventh might be better and suddenly
I rose up in ranks and my confidence
boosted up and I got to know that you
know this getting I mean getting good
grades is not out of my reach I can't
can do it so tell me while growing up
between your parents who had more impact
on your who you are as a person your
mother your father both equally had a
impact I think you are the youngest
sibling right and what about your
sisters like yeah so um being the
household of an academician can be a lot
extreme and when my my dad is like a PhD
holder and my mom was a housem maker uh
my mom was denied education after 8th
because her dad was like hey should I
get her educated and the and the world
was like no she why Beyond age she's not
going to get uh you know person to get
married to and that's it that that kind
of decided her entire life and she's she
still holds on to the feeling that I
should have got educated because how
enterprising my mom is it's amazing it's
amazing she tries so many different
things she's very skilled and she's spot
on with her time and everything so
um when it when it came to a household
of that kind you know we had an a
machine my dad he was like a
perfectionist and my mom who was who was
unfathomably always on us to get
educated don't miss out on what I'm
missing and uh and given the situation
where you know we had a lot of uh uh
relatives and everyone who are like hey
you've got like three daughters man what
are you going to do with their lives
um my dad was like determined I don't
care they're my kids and they are going
to get educated I've done my mtech I've
done my PhD I'll get them educated as
far as they can and the minimum they're
going to go is for
Masters and he did it the kind of
struggles a parent can go through uh
with one single earning member and a mom
like really trying hard to save whatever
she can so she can give the best life
for their kids it's it's I don't think
you can see that in many places except
in India you know moms go uh an extra uh
route and I I still remember one
incident where my sister just had her
baby and then she wanted to go into her
master's degree my dad R ran pillar post
to ensure she gets that seat and uh
there you go relatives came down and
they're like she's just had a baby and
you wanted to get educated is it not
enough if she's done just done her uh uh
bachelors's uh and
my mom stood up and she said which one
of you is going to take care of
her my question is
around when it comes to education on the
ground in the schools there are so many
women yeah why is it that we haven't
seen any women U making this kind of An
Education portal out there yet so I
think there must be some women who who
have done it who have done this kind of
stuff in fact one woman that I globally
uh know and she did extremely well was
Linda you know this company called
linda.com she was one of the she was the
one of the original pioneers of online
learning hosting video content across
anything and everything and linda.com is
what became today LinkedIn learning so
Linda got acquired by LinkedIn which
became part of LinkedIn learning so
she's one such example and India also
there are a lot of many entrepreneur who
are doing a lot of interesting stuff
there is this company called lead school
and she what she does is that she helps
schools become more modern by providing
them technology providing them content I
think she's doing very EXT extremely
well and I'm sure there are many more
that I don't know but yeah I don't think
there's anything in this work that we do
which can't be done by moment in fact
simply learn also 4% of our employees
are women across team so last I thought
that maybe we have more tele callers or
inside sales who are female but that's
not the case even our technology team is
almost 40 45% female okay and if
somebody has to start off you know doing
some something like what you are then
what what's your advice to them I think
the easiest is to start with a YouTube
channel because once you build your some
kind of brand visibility on YouTube
people get start start to know you you
start talking about a certain topic then
from there and make it make that as a
free offering and from there you want to
move them to some kind of paid model I
think uh there will be a lot of takers
who who would like to pay some money to
get additional Services simply learn
also we do a lot of free content on
YouTube we also have this platform
called simply learn skill up where in on
an average we get about 150,000 people
signing up every month and more than
30,000 people completing our programs
every month so if you just go to
LinkedIn and search simply learn skillup
every 2 to five minutes there is someone
who shares a simply learn certificate
that's completely free offering from our
side we are kind of giving back to
people who can't afford they can't pay
and but they just want to learn my next
question is around shortcut versus hard
work and long longterm um benefit so in
education you know Indians do believe in
always going through the long route
getting the degree and I don't see the
same in in other places in other
countries so what's your take on it our
biggest business is in us and we see
this happening all the time that the way
Indian learner thinks about learning
versus the way us learner thinks about
learning is very different see India a
lot of people are learning and they do
not have to worry about their day-to-day
basics of the life right contr to the
belief a typical American is more poorer
than a typical Indian and I'll tell you
why what have you noticed among the
simply Learners is that a typical us
learner that we have has a full-time job
in the day and that job is not paying
him enough so he and she also works as
an waiter or a Uber driver in the
evening to meet their family needs so if
they're learning in the evening that
means they're not earning so how will
the fund for the courses right whereas
that we don't have that kind of
challenges here for an Indian learner so
that's why their shorter crisper works
better they want to learn something that
can help them immediately land up
something better than where where they
stand and if you look at the cost of
degree and in us that's like minding you
can't afford India still relatively much
cheaper for people to afford so there
are like nuances India this is in our
DNA the tougher bigger strong longer is
what we prefer even though we don't uh
go through the entire curriculum but we
want to keep it and we want to take it
and keep it somewhere we don't know for
what but we want to hold that and keep
it with us whereas we take a typical
American Learners they want to spend one
month 2 month 3 month acquire a skill
and then they they can go and Market
that skill to get a job that can help
them get that incremental value in their
earning right so there are nuances that
you have seen and of course we have
different set of program that we offer
in for the US audience and we we offer a
different set of program for Indian
audience there are some common program
like PMP is a very popular certification
in India also as well as in us also but
definitely there are nuances to both the
Western and the Eastern world so great
meeting and really listening about your
story I'm sure lot of our Learners can
relate to your story so I think we have
a round for Rapid fires maybe we can
just look at um asking some of the rapid
questions where you can reply in only
one or two
words yeah so you can start with the
rapid fire proc okay describe yourself
in three words Innovative challenging
very approachable are you a morning
person or a night all morning one skill
you wish you could Master overnight
negotiation what the best advice you
have ever received when was the last
time you did something for the first
time what's the hobby you picked up
during your career break podcasting if
you could switch your career for a day
what would that be heading the United
Nations so I can make sure the good
policies coming out good good what's the
best decision you have ever made to
continue education educating myself if
you could have one piece of advice for
your younger self what would that be
don't be scared about what people are
going to say
just do what you want to and what next
on your booket list more environmental
efforts so thank you gaita for joining
us on as simple as that it's such a
fascinating story I'm sure lot of our
listeners can relate to your story of

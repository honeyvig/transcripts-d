story on simply learn's very own
homegrown podcast as as that Krishna
will be Dawning the Hat of a podcasting
conversing with Learners industry
leaders business partners and anyone who
has insights to share in this episode
Krishna will be chatting up with simply
learn learner Muhammad asfar Hamed who
has quite an interesting story an
aerospace engineer who started off as an
aviation security officer aser switched
tracks to get into the clothing business
later dabbling in crypto trading and
then finally soaring into the Skies of
data
analytics in this conversation he shares
all about his journey so far and some
really interesting insights so let's
Dive Right
In welcome to as simple as that so today
I'm happy to welcome ashar ashar has
been an aeronautical engineer an
entrepreneur as well as a data scientist
he's still very young so we are going to
talk about his story on how it all
started and how he played various roles
but before we get deep into his story
let's first meet who ashar is Asar thank
you for coming on this show please help
us understand our audience about your
family background where did you grw up
and what made you make various decisions
that you have made in life and then
we'll go deeper into each of the aspects
of your life yeah thank you kishna
thanks for having me here and nice to
meet you us I come from a small town
called kilak in Tamil Nadu and from
there my family migrated to Chennai and
we were living this past 20 30 years in
Chennai to give a background about
myself I always have this passion about
aeroplanes rockets and all these things
so that's the reason I chosen artical
engineer as part of my
undergraduate but things it never goes
off like how you plan usually so after
finishing my aeronautical engineer I was
working with data which was though it is
an airline but it was not
technical like what I studied in
aeronautical and post that I was not
interested because there were certain
things I was only doing the same things
repeatedly which I was not uh allowing
myself to do so I shifted my uh thinking
towards being an entrepreneur because
that time entrepreneurship was booming
and people had few ideas which can turn
into greater future as well so as like I
went into entrepreneurship like I
started my own clothing br BR at first
pre pandemic so once that pandemic
happened again things went down the hill
our business where it took Skyrocket it
came back again how the landing happened
in the rocket usually so that case I was
experimenting things like what to do
next what to do here and there and I
shifted my focus towards construction
materials so know they were huge demand
post the pandemic so I took this would
be a nice opportunity to get myself into
something so when I got into this
business that time I understood data
would be a huge impact which would get
into any business and whoever is using
data to their business might have an
upper hand with whatever the competitors
they are competing with so I thought
okay let's get experimented in this and
when I was searching in Internet the
first thing which came to my mind was
simply Lear because they were giving
this kind of an opportunity where you
get to learn what people are doing in
terms of data in in Real uh industrial
scenario I was too curious because I was
not too old to experiment myself I was
in a good age even if things go as not
as expected I always have this
experience to things to handle in a way
I wanted it I enrolled in simply learn
and the first two weeks of the start the
program when it was started the way I
look into Data it had an impact on
myself practical experience is also
required wherein I'm really thankful
that uh simply learned gave me an
opportunity where in we were able to
work on projects which was happening in
real life so what is your current
situation aswar are you working in the
construction business or you are working
as a data scientist somewhere fulltime
what's your current role okay I do have
my business running but it's not me who
is looking into right now I have people
at my family who is looking into that
wherein I want myself turned to be a
data scientist on a full term so I'm
currently working with organization
called K consulting which is basically a
data analytical firm we do have projects
across the world on the data part
especially so you told me so many
different things that you did and it's
really amazing to hear your story and I
have lot of questions and doubts related
to that I'm sure the audience will also
have similar questions and of course
we'll give them an opportunity to ask
once we post these videos but some
things that I want to understand see if
you look at a typical middle class
background that you belong to you
started you grew up in a small Tamil
Nadu maybe town and mov to Chennai is
the capital of Tamil Nadu and a lot of
people do this right I in it happened
with me also I grew up in in Village
then eventually moved to Patna and then
my family was there and then typically
when people move from a small town to a
bigger city that itself is a big change
so once you completed your Aeronautical
Engineering you got first job as a
database person right but in a airline
company which you didn't like and then
you went to two businesses back to back
right garment or say what we call clo
clothing line and construction but how
did you decide to move from clothing
which is one different business to a
construction which is a very different
business like what what made you make
this change and also the related
question that typically people from
middle class background who have was
whose parents has been professional they
don't experiment with business it's
considered to be very risky proposition
so how did you convince your family and
in spite of having a in a way bad
experience not because of you but
because of the market scenarios of covid
hitting how did they again allow you to
do get into construction absolutely
you're right kishna so at the beginning
I usually try to analyze my risk in
terms of whatever I'm doing so that is
something people they usually tell try
and try until you succeed in one
business or something like that but it
doesn't happen in a real way because
you'll have to have a lot of capital in
order to try and try so I thought during
pandemic all the constructions was shut
down and there was nothing happening
throughout the country so I thought this
would be an opportunity which would open
up certain new businesses because what I
realized was I Googled a few dealers
within India and then understood their
kind of reality like what they are going
through because know those people are
manufacturers who had huge capitals
within there and they have to sell it
somehow because they have put in a lot
of investments in there so that was a
kind of an opening wherein I was able to
tie up with those manufacturers and were
able to supply them though it is
pandemic that gave me upper hand from
clothing towards the construction and
also as you said people usually your
family they never allow to kind of
experiment things from this to that
because at least you'll have to prove
yourself in one thing without that you
cannot go and experiment but I have a
nice family who do support me in terms
of whatever I do Let It Be the degree
which I chose and usually people from
middle class they expect if you getting
a degree at least if you are not working
in an aeronautical company let it we you
can work in some kind of a mechanical or
kind of a whatever the job that suits
whatever you have studied near near to
that but uh in my scenario yes there
were few hesitations at the beginning
but I was lucky enough to make them
convince like this is what I wanted to
do and this is what would make me happy
and this uh experimental thing though it
never 100% worked out on business but
the way I chose data to be a career turn
come to be fruitful for me so are you
married no Krishna I'm currently single
only maybe you have more flexibility to
in making decisions right yeah I'm lucky
enough to be like that so when did you
completed your graduation like how many
of years of experience after your
graduation you have so far okay so I
completed my graduation in the year 2017
and right now I have an experience
around six years post start so in six
years you tried three things right you
did artical engineer worked in airline
company tried entrepreneurship twice and
now you're data scientist I think it's a
great Trend to see in general that young
professionals are trying multiple heads
before you really settle on something or
maybe that will never happen so this
reminds me one thing that I noticed long
back so when I was in my first job with
enosis long back and I went to us in
early 2000 so my colleague who was
sitting next to me was a guy who was
roughly at that point of time about 55
years of age and he was a musician
that's what he's he had spent most of
his life and then he took a programming
course and became a software developer
so this was a very New Concept for me
that okay I'm young in my early 20s this
is my first job and my team member is a
person with almost like 50 plus years of
age and doing the same programming work
that I was doing because he thought that
okay music is great but it doesn't pay
him as much as he would expected it to
pay programming was a high paying job so
he learned it and became a programmer so
I think this is great to see this trend
is coming in India also that you from
entrepreneurship to data scientist maybe
you can try something else also in in
life as long as you grow that's great
that's a great Trend to see so when you
see your background I'm sure many of
your classmates or both from your
engineering school as well as from your
high school they might have got into one
area and they're sticking to that
particular area so when you meet with
your friends in general how do look at
their transition do they see that okay
you're trying with various things or
they caution you that okay ashar why are
you trying why are you playing with your
life and career better stick to one
thing otherwise you might be left behind
how do your friends see your career
transition okay uh so there are two
things in this one is as you said there
could be few people who would stick to
their domain and they want to though
they are not getting paid or they don't
have a good role they stick to that
sometimes it might work out but for me I
usually uh if it's not fit for me I'll
not be there so I'm a kind of a person
who wants to be a better of myself like
a version today would not be the same
tomorrow so it is something like that
and yes I do had a few questions and
arguments with my friends in terms of
career because at the beginning when I
was working with AirLand they asked me
to join it at the beginning itself but I
was not convinced to join it because I
was trying pushing myself whether I I
was able to get or land a job whatever I
was looking into in terms of the
aeronautical sector but once I got an
you idea that this would never work out
okay let's move so whenever I get this
feel let's move I'll just move like that
that is my instinct and that is what the
mantra for me right now whatever the
Instinct I'm getting it I'm able to
prove myself okay fine whatever you have
decided is correct so I think that's
really great to hear see if you look at
in today's market there is lot of news
about entrepreneurship right paper is
full about so many successful stories
but at the same time if you take a step
back and we realize that mostly what you
hear about is successful businesses
right people who have become already
gone to a certain stage lot of people
try but they don't end up it's like
restaurant right I've seen a lot of
people students when when they graduate
and they come to cities they generally
go and eat outside and they generally
they go in successful restaurants which
are well running so they get this
thought that okay we can also start a
restaurant that will give make food
related to their area and they'll be
successful and you'll be surprised to
know that it's not a successful business
anywhere is data about New York City
that thousands of restaurant open up
every year and thousands of them they
close and such a big city with so many
people going out and E same happens
everywhere the reason it happens is that
it's not it's not very easy to build
business because one is that your
interest in that particular area but
business also requires a lot of
different aspects of understanding there
the sales marketing customer service
forecasting demand and and so on and so
forth so a lot of people are getting
tempted to do that and they try they
want to try their hands on
entrepreneurship but they have various
constants sometime they don't have
Capital sometime is very difficult for
them to convince their family that okay
they're going to leave their current job
where they're getting paid every month
to try their hand on entrepreneurship so
let's say if somebody comes to you who
has very similar kind of background
middle class family already has a job
but wants to try something else and they
want some tips from you on how can they
convince their family what how will you
what kind of pointers you can give it to
them because it's also important that
while there are a lot of chances of
failure it's good to try once you try
and do it at least you have the
satisfaction that yes I wanted to do it
I did it whether I'm successful or not
but at least I experienced it firstand
so how what trips you'll give them to
convince their family yeah the first and
foremost what I'll tell is let's not
bring in success at the beginning let's
assume what if you are not succeeding
and what how the impact will it it will
be on your side okay so that is some
something people have to think because
you cannot become Amani overnights and
within a period of month or something
like that okay so what if you're not
going to succeed and how will it impact
this is something people are not
understanding it because they will
always think okay it's good to be
positive but at the same time you have
to think at the negative ways also don't
mistake me if I'm talking negative
things but these are the things that is
affecting more and more entrepreneurs
moving forward understanding and getting
things is fine but implementing things
is a different way so you'll have to
whatever the ideologies you are getting
inside you'll have to implement though
it is a hardship you'll have to prove
them and then at the beginning as you
said family will not support even your
friends will not support there could be
few days which uh I personally got into
this I was left all alone because I
chose this way so never be afraid to be
alone to work alone because that is
something people even Jeff Bezos when he
started Amon he was working alone at the
office and this is how huge businesses
start so people will never have to be
afraid of being left alone that is just
a beginning of your journey and when
you're getting further into your journey
you will get people Whoever has left you
alone along with people who would be
supporting you as well no great point
you made two broadly two big points and
I completely agree with it first point
is that don't always be over optimistic
that if you start you're going to be
successful uccessful right because if
you have lesser expectation maybe it
will be a good place because there are
so many unknowns in the business I
completely agree in fact I can tell you
with my experience of last 20 years that
I've been I've have hired so many
individuals across various roles both
India us and and many other countries I
can tell you that if I today get two
profiles of individuals who have a
pretty much similar education background
maybe they worked in similar kind of
companies somebody has tried
entrepreneurship versus somebody has not
tried entrepreneurship I'll preer person
who has tried entrepreneurship because
see as an entrepreneur while you try
things and you don't end up successful
what you still walk away is the a great
experience of making things work right I
think I'll also tell this audience that
if you're thinking about doing just go
ahead and do it even if you're not
successful the experience is going to be
worth it right so that's one great point
I completely agree second point that you
made that when you start everybody will
discourage and that I've seen especially
if you look at friends they say okay you
are making a a bad decision by leaving
something that is stable and trying
something new
now along with the self-belief you also
need to become lucky at some point of
time so I can also say that most
businesses who eventually end up
becoming successful something or else
works out for them so if you are
starting and for you it's not working
you should not get disheartened maybe
there's always a next time and something
better is waiting for you so that's
really a great point now as for I we
talked about a lot about
entrepreneurship and your journey let's
move to not data science part see data
science has gained so much of importance
in last few years right it's considered
to be the best possible job that one can
get so help our audience understand that
is it really so great everybody wants to
become a data scientist and everybody
gets excited about the growth prospects
the salary growth they also like that
okay you can bring Insight that helps
company make decision all that is great
but is it really fun working at the data
scientist or maybe some part is fun but
still there is a lot of day-to-day
routine work that you have to do which
is get another job how do you see your
current
role yeah many people they think when
you Google the recent highest PID job
you would either be a data scientist or
a data analyst something that is comes
up with data okay so people they are
pumped up with okay fine if you become a
data scientist or a data analyst you'll
be getting huge payout it is another job
wherein like you'll have to do your
duties and there could be hardships
there could be fun there could be
challenges and yes data is fun data is
challenging data is more insights and
data would be something like in the
future it will never die off because
this is a start of an error and I don't
think so it has an end great point ashar
so knowing you like your personality
that you always are questioning the
status quo started with one thing moved
to another now you're doing the your
third gig what next for you like are you
going to be like seeing yourself in the
current role for a long period of time
or you're already trying to identify
what more you can for example I see a
lot of people who are data scientist or
who have career in data who have worked
in couple of years they are not thinking
about AI because AI has suddenly made
all of us think about our role our
existence in general a different way of
looking at their current responsibility
their current roles and in general the
current impact that they're creating
through their work so how do you see AI
in your world okay this is the recent
thing like people are hesitant or in a
stage where whether AI could replace
their job yes to some extent it might
replace some some of our roles but it is
not completely you cannot write off
humans in terms of AI because humans are
humans a AI right now if you would ask
me yes I am supportive to AI because I
want myself to be more productive and I
see AI as a tool to be more productive
than what I'm doing right now so you'll
have to differentiate it and yes a is
the future and I'm really happy that we
are in a generation where we are
experiencing this kind of a trend or
kind of a change in the current
existence to what we see in terms of
Technology yes AI is something like I
would be taking up more in towards my
job as
well got it are you learning AI I'm
learning AI but it's there is something
like it is very basic or I'm just
started off but see my view is that is
definitely the future and and this is
the future of data I'm sure some point
in time you have to learn but still
there's no hurry the key thing is that
you should not stop your learning go
anywhere that sus your budget that suits
your style that suits your lifestyle
that suits your your schedule but don't
stop learning so that's has been my
message to anyone who contact me so
ashar you played various roles
Aeronautical Engineering entrepreneur
now data scientist and I'm there are
like successes and failures in each of
your journey so now that you are
enjoying your new work as a data
scientist is is a very I'll say one of
the most in demand roles that we can
think of how are your parents viewing
your journey like how do you how do they
feel proud they think that you should go
back to entrepreneurship that you're not
that successful but still the potential
was maybe much higher than what you're
currently doing so tell me your how is
your family looking at your current role
and your current position yeah they are
I would say they are relieved more than
happy because I found away somehow after
struggling through all these hardships
and they as parents would always be
happy when their child or is doing
something extraordinary or some achieve
something in whatever he or she is doing
and that is in terms of family and
coming to my friends at the beginning I
was telling them okay fine at least now
I'll do this course and let me see and
the reactions was usually they don't
want me to do this because whatever I
was doing in business okay that is fine
right why do you want to change it but
post whatever I have gone so far I had a
reverse reaction stating that few of my
friends wanted to have a referral in
terms of the data wise and I even
referred a few of my friends to Simply
learn as well because they wanted to
shift their career from whatever they
are doing in terms of moving into Data
so I was happy because I was doing
something meaningful in that way people
can also do the same thing replicate
that and then achieve Greater Heights
that's really great to know so thanks
for sharing that story I'm sure parents
will be proud because at least I agree
they're more relieved because they know
that you have found your calling so
that's really great to know so ashar now
the you spoke about your family you
spoke about your friends if you have to
give him a suggestion or a or advice to
a younger self of you somebody who's
just coming out of the college what
would be what would that be don't be
hesitant to make mistakes that is what I
would do because the mistakes you do is
something that is the experience to
learn something I would say don't be
hesitant to do mistakes and also try to
experiment in a way that doesn't affect
you m Mally because there could be few
people what they do is they over stress
theirself and then they lose it all the
way so I would say take your risk in a
calculated way and make sure like at the
end of The Journey you remain happy
though you succeeded or not but because
you at least have a tried on that and
then make yourself clear like this is
what you're going to do and this is what
I would be if even if it is not
happening the way I want it those are
all great points I have if have to add
I'll just add only one point that the
best time to experiment is when you are
young because you have nothing to lose
the only thing that you get in in fact
when you lose also you win win
experience so try various things till
you settle in something that really
gives you Joy and it's proven across the
world across the industry that people
become successful by doing things that
they really enjoy so great Point as for
and thank you for sharing that with the
audience yeah thank you Krishna it's
been a know pleasure to have spoken
about this because this is a platform
which would reach more people and uh
that would be helpful for Our Generation
whatever the the because there might be
few confusions here and there and this
would be much more crystal clear for at
least for few of the people if it's
going to reach them I'll be really happy
for that no definitely that's our goal
see see we see so many successful people
whose podcasts are available and people
try to get inspired by them but again
there are different kinds of people
there are some people have very
successful not everybody can get there
because of various reasons some in
control some not in in a person's
control but there are stories like you
where people can relate to it and they
can try to achieve that so I think
that's what we want to promote that
everybody is special everybody has
abilities everybody if they start
questioning their ability there is much
more they can achieve than what they
think they are capable of right so
that's our goal here that we are
promoting it was great speaking to you
as simple as that it's a platform where
we share stories about common people but
who had an uncommon Journey so thank you
audience for listening to us for stories
if you liked part of the story if you
got inspired if you got motivated please
do share with us and we'll bring more
such a stories as we go along thank
you

description to Fast Track Your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back month one computer science
fundamentals and beginners python so
before we delve into AI it's crucial to
establish a strong foundation in
computer science this month you should
focus on the following topics data
representation
understanding bits and bytes how text
and numbers are stored and the binary
number system is foundational for
everything in Computing this knowledge
helps in comprehending how computers
interpret and process data now next
comes computer networks learn the basics
of computer networks including IP
addresses and internet routing protocols
it's essential to understand how data
travels across networks using UDP TCP
and HTTP which form the backbone of the
internet and the worldwide web next
comes programming Basics begin with the
basics of programming like variables
strings numbers conditionals loops and
algorithm Basics these fundamentals will
allow you to write and understand simple
programs simultaneously you'll also
start with python the preferred language
for AI so learn about variables numbers
strings lists dictionaries sets tuples
and control structures like if
conditionals and for loops and then move
on to functions and modules understand
how to create functions including Lambda
functions and work with modules by using
pip install to add functionality to your
projects next comes file handling and
exceptions you should also practice
reading from and writing to files as
well as handling exceptions to make your
programs more robust finally graphs the
basics of classes and objects which are
crucial for writing organized and
efficient code so this comprehensive
overview sets the stage for more complex
programming tasks that you'll encounter
in the following months now in month two
you'll move on to data structure
algorithms and advanced python so
building on the foundations from month
one we now delve into data structure and
algorithm so familiar ize yourself with
the concept of biger notation to
understand the efficiency of different
algorithms and data structures learn
about arays Ling list hash tables Stacks
cues trees and graphs mastering these
structures will allow you to store and
manipulate data effectively now next
comes algorithms you should explore
algorithms such as binary search bubble
sort quick sort mer sort and recursion
these are essential for optimizing your
code and parall you'll Advance your
python skills so you can dive into
inheritance generators itation list
comprehensions decorators
multi-threading and multi-processing
these topics will enable you to write
more efficient and scalable code so this
month's learning prepares you to handle
complex data operations and enhance your
coding efficiency now in month three
you'll move on to Version Control SQL
and data manipulation so in the third
month the focus shifts to collaboration
and data management number one Version
Control so understand the importance of
Version Control Systems especially git
and GitHub so learn basic commands such
as ADD commit and push you should also
also learn how to handle branches reward
changes and understand Concepts like
head diff and merge so these skills are
invaluable for tracking changes and
collaborating with other developers next
pool requests Master the art of creating
and managing pool requests to contribute
to collaborative projects next we'll
dive into SQL for managing databases so
first we'll start with SQL Basics so
learn about relational databases and how
to perform basic queries and then you'll
move on to Advanced queries understand
complex query techniques such as CT
subqueries and window functions and then
comes joints and database management so
study different types of joints like
Left Right inner and full joint we
should also learn how to create
databases manage indexes and write
stored procedures Additionally you will
use numai and pandas for data
manipulation and learn basic data
visualization techniques this
comprehensive skill set will be crucial
As you move into more advanced data
science topics so now in month four
you'll deal with maths and statistics
for AI so mathematics and statistics are
the backbone of AI and this month is
dedicated to these critical subjects so
first learn about descriptive versus
inferential statistics continuous versus
discrete data nominal versus ordinal
data measures of central tendency like
mean median mode and measures of
dispersion like variance and standard
deviation after that understand the
basis of probability and delve into
normal distribution correlation and
cience after which you should move on to
advanced concepts so you can study the
central limit theorem hypothesis testing
P values confidence intervals and so on
in parallel you should also study linear
algebra and calculus so in linear
algebra learn about vectors metrices
Egan values and Egan vectors and in
calculus cover the basics of integral
and differential calculus so this
mathematical Foundation is essential for
developing and understanding AI models
setting you up for success as you
transition into machine learning now in
month five comes exploratory data
analysis which is Eda and machine
learning so with a solid foundation in
math and statistics you are now ready to
delve into machine learning number one
pre-processing learn how to handle na
values treat out layers perform data
normalization and conduct future
engineering you should also understand
encoding techniques such as one hard and
label encoding we'll also explore
supervised and unsupervised learning
with a focus on regression and
classification and learn about linear
models like linear and logistical
regression and nonl models like decision
tree random Forest Etc and then
understand how to evaluate models using
metrics such as mean squared error mean
absolute error me for aggression and
accuracy precision recall Etc then comes
hyperparameter tuning learn about
techniques like git search CV and random
search CV for optimizing your models
after which we'll move on to
unsupervised learning here you can study
clustering techniques like K means and
hierarchical clustering and delve into
dimensionality reduction with PC so this
month's focus on Eda and model building
will prepare you for more complex AI
applications transitioning to the next
phase you'll begin to work on deploying
these models and real world scenarios so
in month six comes mlops and machine

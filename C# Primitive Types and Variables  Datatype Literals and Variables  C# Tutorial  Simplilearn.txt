hey everyone i am pepper khandelwal and
i welcome you all to our simply launch
youtube channel today we will talk about
one of the interesting topics that are c
sharp primitive types and variables
but before we begin let me tell you guys
we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for a latest
technological advancements then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon to never miss an update on simply
learn
now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with the
variable
then we will discuss the types of
variables
after that we will discuss the primitive
types of variables in detail
finally we will wind up this session
with an implementation on c sharp
variables
now let's get started with what a
variable is
a variable is simply the name provided
to a storage location that our programs
can access
in c programming each variable has a
type that governs the size and layout of
the variable's memory the range of
values that can be stored inside that
memory and a set of operations that can
be applied to that variable
each variable data type must match the
data type of the value stored in that
variable
when we declare a variable the system
reserves a piece of memory equal to the
variable size
now let's have a look at the types of
variables
there are two types of variables in c
sharp
first primitive type variables and
reference or object variables
in this session we will focus on
primitive variables and we will only
discuss strings from the object-based
variables
now let's discuss them in detail
first are primitive types
the data types which are built in the
main function are called primitive data
type
penetrated data types can be further
divided into numbers and truth
values the numbers are then divided into
signed and unsigned data type
let's have a look at them in detail
first up signed data type
we have tabulated the characteristics to
differentiate them we will start with
signed byte its value range tangles
between -128 to 127
then we have short
this one has a lot of memory space
and its value range is from -32k to
positive 32k
after this we have an int or integer
data type it is the most utilized data
type in any programming language
its value goes from -2 billion to
positive 2 billion
at last we have long data type
this can store an incredibly large value
variable
now let's have a look at unsigned data
type
unsigned data type can only store
positive values
we will start with a byte its value
range tangled between 0 to 255
then we have unsigned
short or u short this one has a lot of
memory space then byte
and its value range is from 0 to 65
grand
after this we have u end or unsigned
integer data type
its value goes from 0 to 4 billion
at last we have u long or unside long
data type
this can store an incredibly large value
variable and these were the integer base
private data types
now let's take a look at floating point
types
there are three types of floating point
type variables
float double and decimal
now floating points types are after a
point just an approximate value
now they are differentiated based on the
precision digits
now these fixing points may differ based
on how big or small a value is
now let's discuss a few more types of
data type
first up care
this one store characteristics which are
in theory unicodes essentially a number
next up boolean this variable stores
truth and false values
these are usually used in conditional
statements
next up is an honorary primitive type
which is string usually a string is not
considered a permitted type but in c
sharp it is not the case
string can contain a word or a sentence
now let's try these variables in a
correlator
let's start with signed integer types
first up s byte
let this variable be sb
and equals to negative
120. next up short
as
is equals to
30 000.
and
i
should be equals to
let's take a big number so
around
2 billion
next up
we have
long
l
equals to
let's check
a bigger number than the two billion
now let's try to print them
so we can use console
dot
write line
sb
and then
s
then we have
i
then we have l
let's save them
and
print it
as you can see it is printing minus 120
for the s byte
and thirty thousand for short two
billion for integer and a big number for
long
now
let's try some different types of
integers
let's use unsigned integers
inside integer
types
now we will have byte
a
b
is equals to
122
then we will have
u short
us
is equals to
let's say
60123
next we have cue it
ui
is equals to
since we can go
up to 4 billion
so
let's take 400 million
then we have
u long
ur
is equals to
we can give it
a big number
now let's try and print them
we can copy these
and change the variable names
this is
b this is us
this is ui
this is your
and let's save them
let's comment them as well
to avoid confusion
now let's save and run them again
as you can see now they are printing the
byte byte u short u n
and u long
now
let's comment everything
now let's discuss the floating point
types
let's start with the float
let's take value as 12.7
now you have to remember when defining a
float we need to give f as its
at last character in its value
then we have double
d
is equals to
let's say 23.67
then we have decimal
dm is equals to
99.1079
now this also should end with an m
now let's try to print them
this one should be f
the next one should be d
then dn
let's save them and run them again
now as you can see it is printing the
float value without an f
then a double value then a decimal value
without them
now
let's try
the boolean character and string values
let's start within care
care c
is equals to
t
another a boolean
flag
and let's give it value as true
let's also have a string
str
is equals to
welcome
to
simply learn
now let's try to print them
this time
let's change the variable to c
then
flag
then we have str
now let's save them
and run them again
now as you can notice that for the
character it is printing the same as it
is character
then the flag is it is printing true
and for the string it is printing
welcome to simpler
we can also change
the flag
from true to false by just adding an
exclamation point behind the number so
let's save
and run it
and now you can see it is toggling
between false

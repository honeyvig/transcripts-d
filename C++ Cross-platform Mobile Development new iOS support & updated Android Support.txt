to introduce myself I'm Anana a program
manager in the visual C plus plus team
one of my focus areas is to work on
crossplatform mobile development
experience for visual studio today
specifically I'm going to start with
providing you a very short overview of
crossplatform mobile development I will
also follow this up by highlighting the
key capabilities that visual C++ is
going to provide to Aid the
crossplatform development story I will
also demonstrate these capabilities
through a help of a short
demo modern development today requires
developers to provide their applications
across multiple device platforms from an
application development perspective C++
serves as a great choice as it allows
developers to reuse their crossplatform
code across a variety of device
platforms keeping the development cost
slow starting with Visual Studio 2015
visual C++ will provide a great
experience for crossplatform
development using visual C++ 2015
developers will be able to acquire all
their crossplatform mobile development
software easily and stay current with
frequent
updates visual C++ 2015 will also allow
developers to build crossplatform mobile
applications lever leveraging C++ for
all major mobile
platforms in addition to this Visual
Studio experience will also allow
developers to share and reuse their
crossplatform code easily and Top This
by providing the fastest debugging
experience for all these mobile
platforms
with that said let's now demonstrate
these capabilities through a sh
demo as a part of the file new project
menu developers will now see the
crossplatform node light up under visual
C++ with this node selected developers
can view a wide range of templates made
available to them let's take a look at a
few of
them the dynamic shared Library template
will allow developers to create a
dynamic shared library for the Android
platform this Library will contain all
the cc++ code and can then be used to
create an end to an application using
Java or
samarin the other newly added basic
application Android template allows
developers to create an end an
application in
Java and the make file project template
will allow developers to Port over their
source code easily from other IDs as it
leverages ndk
build also notice the crossplatform
templates which are used to Target and
share crossplatform code between
multiple platforms including iOS which
we enabled
recently the last template that I want
to talk about is the native activity
template Android with API level 9
release the ability to create a complete
end an application in C++ this style of
application is popular with game engines
and other game like
things let's further explore this
template type by looking at an
example
so here I have the open dual example
solution it has two projects the native
activity project contains all the cc++
code let us further explore the project
by taking a look at the project
properties project properties allow
users to view edit modify important
project characteristics for example
using the target API level project
property developers can set the API
level that want to Target for their
application using the platform tool set
property developers can choose the
platform tool set that they want to
choose for building their application we
currently support both clang and GCC
tool
chains the last property I want to talk
about here is the configuration type
project property this property allows
developers to choose what kind of
application they're building in this
case we're building a dynamic sh library
or ano
file let's now hit cancel and take a
look at the other
project the packaging project is used to
take the existing Dynamic Shar library
and create an end to an Android
application using the an build
system for the next part of the demo I
want to bring up some source code to
demonstrate the feature
capabilities for doing so I'm going to
bring up the main. CVP source file and
Traverse to the Android uncore main
function Android uncore main function is
a characteristic function for Native
activity application type and acts as an
entry
point as I play around in this
function notice some of the code
authoring features that we've introduce
for example the Android specific
intelligence experience lighting up here
as I want to as I choose the Android
lock print
API other featur features for code
editing and authoring such as code
navigation work well as well to
demonstrate this take a look at the peak
definition feature in action
here all in all we've ported most of our
code authoring features from the Windows
Experience and extended them for the
Android platform as well this will
provide you a good Cod experience when
When developing inside visual
studio for the next part of the demo I
want to go ahead and show you the
debugger capabilities for doing so I
want to set a bunch of break
points notice the drop- down debugger
menu is already populated with the fast
x66 Microsoft Android
emulator this emulator is already
running in the
background so I'm just going to go ahead
and hit
F5 on hitting F5 my application is built
and then deployed onto the
emulator notice the breake point that I
set was
hit also notice the debugger Windows
such as the auto
window the locals
window the threads window and other
debugger Windows such as the call stack
all light up nicely as well
as I mentioned the Android debugger
inside of Visual Studio that we've
developed is the fastest debugger on the
Windows platform when debugging Android
code to demonstrate this notice as I
actually move between different
breakpoints furthermore using this
debugger experience developers can also
pass commands directly to GDB using the
command window for
example
in this case I'm viewing the I'm viewing
the back trace for my application that's
currently running using GTP
exec next I'm going to hit continue and
let the app
run this app is a basic opengl app and
responds to user Touch by changing
screen color notice that happening as I
click on the emulator
screen
the Elder itself also has other
capabilities for example you can rotate
the screen and view how your application
actually
operates I'm going to hit continue again
because my debugger break points were
hit or you can also leverage other other
sensors that the debugger actually
provides we currently support the
accelerator sensor the location sensor
the network sensor and so
on all in all this is our development
experience for Android when using visual
C++ in the next part of this demo I'm
going to show you how to debug a preix
zixing Android application package file
that you built in another
IDE for doing so bring up the file new
project menu and choose the dynamic
share library application type
I'm going to name this project ibug
pre-existing big Maps APK and click
okay on doing so this creates the debug
pre-existing Mig Maps APK project
type choose the configuration that you
want to debug for and hit
build
next bring up the debugger property
pages and fill in the following
information this information includes
the package to launch which is the pth
to the
APK
the package name
itself which can be found in the Android
manifest.xml
the launch activity which can also be
found in the Android
manifest and last the symbol search path
which
contains the symbols for your
application
type click
okay the next thing we need to do is
bring some Source from the big Maps
application so that we can debug it into
visual studio for doing so I'm going to
bring up the map Network manager. CVP
source file into
vs since we will be using this project
only for deploying this application and
not building I'm going to uncheck build
in configuration manager and click
apply
I'm going to set a breakpoint in this
begin get URL function which gets called
during the big Maps
initialization at this point I'm ready
to debug my big Maps APK using visual
studio all I need to do now is hit F5
notice that this application is getting
deployed to your
device the Bing Maps APK is pretty large
in size and the symbol search path
contains over 500 MB of debug
information which is currently getting
loaded as you can see from the loading
symbols notice that the brake point that
I set was hit and the autos and the
locals window are light up nicely as
well using this experience developers
can use the visual studio debugger for
their pre existing Android application
package files without moving completely
into Visual
Studio thanks for watching this video to

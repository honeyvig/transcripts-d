
For us it's not just about falling in love with new technology but
it's about being able to apply a breakthrough in computer vision and
creating an application like CGI or taking something like Gates.
I mean it's phenomenal.
I see what has happened inside of Microsoft in the last four years or
so?
There's been a renaissance all sorts of people have come together and
said let's just raise accessibility of Grace universal design and all
these technologies we talk about all have come out.
This is a journey this is not something we claim to be the best at
this it's about making sure that you're empowered that you have all
the resources available.
And that's never been more important for us to have people with
disabilities in the fabric of Microsoft.
The best thing we do is make sure every single Washingtonian gets to
exercise their talents.
That kind of spirit that so many of you have helped us advance here at
Microsoft that has led to our inclusive hiring programs.
Let's use this movement to really define Seattle as a city of
inclusion.
Microsoft has now looked upon as one of the global leaders in
disability inclusion.
And what we need to do is to start breaking down more of these
barriers to get people with disabilities into the workforce.
We have over a billion people with disabilities if our products don't
work for a few people on the planet.
We're missing an incredible business opportunity.
This is something that we will continually love.
But making sure that we think about just cool features within our
products and empowering the party and 80 partners with a much broader
spectrum of products.

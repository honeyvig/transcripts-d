creating a car racing game using HTML
CSS and JavaScript can be fun and
challenging way to learn web development
in this video we'll guide you through
the process of creating a car racing
game using these Technologies first
let's talk about HTML HTML is a markup
language used to structure web pages
when creating a car racing game you'll
need to use HTML to create the game
board game pieces and rules you'll also
need to use CSS to style the game board
and the game pieces CSS Styles web pages
and is used to give the game a visual
appeal next let's talk about JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language
used to add interactivity to web pages
when creating a car racing game you will
use JavaScript to add actions to game
pieces and rules to the game Bo you can
use JavaScript to add animations sounds
and effects to the game making it more
engaging and realistic with all these
Technologies in place you can start
creating your car racing game you will
need to create game pieces such as cars
roads and obstacles you can also create
rules such as speed limits and points
for winning once you have all these
elements in place you can use Javas
script to add interactivity to the game
you can create animations sounds and
effects to make the game more engaging
so whether you are just getting started
with web development or you are a Season
Pro creating a car racing game using
HTML CSS and JavaScript can be fun and
challenging way to learn these
Technologies and if you are looking for
more resources on web development we

opportunity the course link is provided
in the description box below so let's
start creating some car racing games and
build our web development skills before
we move ahead to this another JavaScript
game I'll recommend you to go through
the previous video wherein we created
Flappy Bird from scratch so I want you
to go through that video because many of
the things will remain same in this
particular video as well so please go
through that video as well today we'll
create a car game in which we have to
save a car from obstacles coming towards
our vehicle I don't know the exact name
for this game but let me give you an
overview of this game real quick so here
is the game you can can see over the
screen wherein we have a red car on the
road and we have to protect this car by
moving to the left or right all we have
to do is to protect this red car from
collision with the blue one now I know
the graphics for these games are not too
much appealing but if you want to make a
high-end Graphics game then JavaScript
is not the only language you can use we
have to use many different JS libraries
and maybe several other programming
languages along with JavaScript to
achieve this task so let's focus on
these small games for now and we'll go
ahead step by step now in this
particular game if you see here we have
three images one is of red car the other
one is of blue car and a road behind
them right so let's move on to the
programming part directly and most of
the parts will remain the same like that
of Flappy Birds let's move on to vs code
so here is our game this is the HTML
file and then we have a CSS file and
Javascript file for this game now what
we'll do first is we'll create a div tag
we have to protect a block right we have
to move the container either to the left
or to the right so for that we have to
create div Tex so first of all we'll
write here div we'll take this
particular div tag for the game and
we'll write here another div with ID as
game fine now we have two div tags over
here now what we'll do first is we'll
add images for red car and for blue car
right so what we'll do is we'll take two
div texts and we'll write here ID as
blue
car for the blue car and then we'll
write
here
IMG SRC The Source will
be blue do PNG so we have a file named
blue.png which is actually an image and
what we'll do is we'll write here alt so
the alternate will
be blue car fine we'll copy this piece
of code and we'll do the same for red
vehicle as well so instead of blue car
we'll name the ID as red car the image
source we have in a computer is
red.png and Alternate will be red car
fine now we have added the two cars to a
divtech or we can say to a HTML file
save it go to the browser so this is our
document you can see here we have a blue
car and we have a red car you can see we
have both images over here but the size
is different the blue car looks big and
the red one is pretty small right not to
worry we'll figure it out in the CSS
part so let's do the rest of the HTML
part here what we'll do is we'll move to
our HTML file again and now one thing
you might have noticed in the game here
is on on collision we are getting a card
for game over so we have to create this
div tag as well so let's finish the HTML
part first what we'll do is we'll write
here div
again and this time the ID will be
result so we are preparing for the game
over part right now what we'll do is
we'll write here H1 heading so inside H1
we'll write game over so let me show you
why we are doing this so if you can see
here on collision we have game over
right so game over we have to write here
now what we'll do is we'll write here
game over like this the next thing we
need is the score so what we'll do is
we'll write here P so we'll use the
paragraph tag the ID will be
score and the score will do in
JavaScript part now what we have to do
is we have to add the restart button as
well so for that we'll write here
button ID is equals to let's say
BTN and we'll use the on click event so
on click we'll write
here location
Dot reload we'll call this function so
this is a built-in function in
JavaScript what this function will do is
it will refresh the whole page fine the
game will start again so we have added
another div tag for the score here we
have a heading game over and a paragraph
with ID as score and then we have a
button to reload the web page now let's
style these elements and make them look
like a game so what we'll do is we'll
move to the CSS file now here's a CSS
file
we'll first write here some code for the
whole HTML document so for inside this
we'll Define
margin and the default margin will be
zero similarly we'll Define padding as
well so the default padding will also be
zero now the next thing we have to do is
we have to write here some code for the
body fine here what we'll do is we'll
use two colors at a specific angle of
45° we have already been through the web
kit linear gradient property in the
previous game which is Flappy Bird so
what we'll do is we'll write here let's
take a background color let's say the
background color is this kind of sky
blue now the next thing we'll do is
we'll take a background image and inside
this we'll write webkit linear gradient
we have already been through this in the
previous game so we'll write here
45° this is the angle and then we'll
Define two colors here so a two colors
will
be gray and the next one will also be
gray but a little bit different from
this one so we'll write here 45% it will
take 45% of the screen screen and then
we'll write here hash so this is the
code for dark gray color and it will
take the rest 55% of the screen fine
save it for now go to the web browser so
you can see here we have two different
colors present over here in a web
browser the colors are divided at an
angle of 45° what we can do here is we
can write
here 50/50 instead for both the
colors save it now move to the browser
and here you can see you can clearly
Spot the Difference here so here you can
see these two colors are different now
we'll leave it here you can do this
thing as you wish so moving ahead we'll
write here
Min height will be 800 pixels fine save
it now move to the browser and here you
can see we have a background color set
for this particular web page now
so after the body tag we'll do some
styling for the game container so here
you can see we have the IDS game for the
first div tag so what we'll do is we'll
write
here game we'll we'll write some
properties here we'll write here height
so the height will be 500 pixels then
we'll write here width the width of the
box is let's say 300
pixels and the Border will also Define
so the Border will be
black and the Border will be 1 pixel
thick solid and black in color fine save
it you can see over
here so we can't see anything for now so
let's style this first completely what
we'll do is we'll write here margin so
the margin will
be one
ram
Auto now
right here we'll write background image
so the background image is the one we
already have in a folder the name for
that image is road
one.png now we'll write here
background size so we'll write here
contain to fit this image inside the
container and we'll write here
overflow as hidden fine save it
move to the browser and here you can see
now we have a div tag present over here
we have a container over here and we
have the blue image only for now now
what we'll do next is we'll style these
images as well so first we'll do the
same for blue car we'll write here blue
car and inside this we'll
write height is 100
pixels width will be 130 pixels so
there's a specific reason behind writing
this 130 pixel we'll understand it later
now the background color for this car
will be let's say blue for the blue
one and we'll write here position so the
position will
be
relative next up we'll write here top
stop will be 0 pixels so remember the
value for these properties we'll need
them later in the Javas script part now
what we'll do next is we'll write here
left as 0
pixels now next up we'll write here text
align as
Center and animation so this animation
we have already been through it now what
we'll do is we'll write here
move after 1 second the animation should
be
linear and it should be infinite fine
now this animation we have to Define but
before that we'll write here blue car
IMG so here what we'll do is we'll
Define the height of
image we'll write your height as 100
pixels fine now save this go to the
browser and here you can see we have a
blue car present at the top left corner
of a container now what we'll do is
we'll Define the animation for this
particular div tag right so here is our
car present at the top left corner so
what we'll do is we'll move this box to
the middle of the screen so we have
already done it I guess but there is
some mistake so here you can see we have
given space between run Ram save it now
and here you can see we have a box
present at the center of a screen now we
are good to go next up we'll Define the
animation so we'll write here at the
rate key frame and and instead of
identifier the identifier we have here
is move
fine so inside this we'll write here 0%
at
0% the top will be zero fine zero pixels
and at 100% the top will
be 5001
pixels fine now one thing to notice here
is the total height of the container is
500 pixels and the animation will go
till 51 pixels save it now move to the
browser and here you can see the car is
still not moving so we have made a
mistake here so here's a mistake we have
to write here move only save it now and
here you can see the animation is going
swiftly now so the car starts from 0
pixel and goes till 51 pixel so it will
happen in in finitely because we have
used the infinite inside the animation
property what we'll do next is we'll do
the same for red car as well fine so
here you can see we have a red car the
ID is red car for this so what we'll do
is we'll write here HH red car and we'll
start styling this red car as well the
height will remain the same the height
will be 100 pixels and then we have the
width the width will be 130 pixels for
this car as well the background color
will be red because the car color is
also red Position will be relative for
this as well the top will be 250 pixels
let's say and the left will be 130
pixels fine now what we are doing here
is we are taking the left as 130 pixels
why so because what we want is we want
the car to be present at 130 pixels away
from from the left corner of the box so
that's why we have written 130 pixels
over here inside the left property now
the next thing we'll right here is text
align and text align will be
sent fine we'll do the same thing for
red car as well here we'll write here
red car
IMG we have to write here hash as well
now inside this we'll Define the height
of this image we'll write here height as
100 100 pixels
fine save it now go to the browser and
here you can see we have a red and blue
car over here now the Box seems to be a
little bit less wide for these two cars
so what we'll do is we'll write the
width here is 390 pixels so that it will
be divided equally in three parts save
it now and here you can see now this box
looks totally fine we have a red car
present in the center we can move it to
the left and to the right so we are done
with styling these three images next up
we have to style the result part as well
right so here you can see in this
particular game we have a card over here
with a different background the game
over color is white and this color is
gray I guess the button color is black
and the restart color is sky blue fine
so we have to keep all these things in
mind we have to style this box as well
so what we'll do is we'll write here
result and inside this we'll write
height height will be 200 pixels for
this box then we'll write
here width and width will be 400 pixels
so we want a rectangle for this next up
we'll write here background
color so let's define the RGB value the
RGB value for this particular color is
231
comma 105 comma
105 that's because we want to make the
exact same game so that's why we are
using the RGB values here save it now
move to the browser and here you can see
we have the game over card over here and
the game over color is black and the
card color is pinkish we can say now
we'll move to a CSS file we'll write
here margin and the margin will be
one ram
Auto next up we'll write
here border radius so we want the box to
be a little bit round from the edges so
for that we'll write here border radius
is 20
pixels and then we
have font size is 30 pixels for game
over then we'll write
here text we want to align the text at
the center of this
box game over color will be white fine
so we'll write here white and we are
done with it save
it and here you can see we have a box
over here we have a game over card over
here now what we want is we want to hide
this thing right so for that we have to
write here display as none save it now
and you can see we don't have this game
over box over here here anymore now
moving back to our CSS file what we'll
do is we'll remove this particular
statement for now save it and here's a
box again we'll add this property later
so for now what we'll do is we'll write
here score now what we have to do is we
have to write here
font
size as 2.2 RM I hope you guys must have
served first for the ram keyword now
we'll discuss this keyword again in the
next video so for now we'll write here
color and the color will be let's say
take any color of your choice so we'll
write here
gray or we can say let's take Golden Rod
I don't know which color is it but let's
take it once save
it and you are not getting anything over
here because we haven't find it yet so
we'll see it later now the last thing we
have to do here is with the button right
so we'll use the button ID for that
we'll write here BTN and inside this
we'll write pedding so pedding will be
0.5
R
and one RM for left now we'll write here
border radius for this button is 20
pixels because the button is a little
bit round at the
Corners next up we'll write
here border is none we don't need any
border for this particular button then
we'll write here background color is
let's
say
black we'll write here the color
is which color we should take let's take
this one now we'll write here margin top
so let's say the margin top will be 10
pixels next up we'll write here cursor
so cursor will be pointer fine cursor
will change to pointer on taking it over
the restart button we'll write
here text transform we want to transform
this text to
uppercase fine save it now move back to
the browser and here you can see we have
a game over over here but this tag is
not working for
now so let's see what's wrong
here okay so we have to write here
restart save it
now and here you can see we have a
button over here we have a restart
button over here the button looks a
little bit small so what we have to do
is we have to do some styling change
here we'll take let's say the font size
so we'll write here
font size is let's say 25
pixels save it now and here you can see
the button is quite right
now so we are done with it what we'll do
is we'll add the display property here
we'll write here display none save
it and the box is gone fine now we are
done with the CSS part as well now we
have to make this game responsive only
that will do with the help of JavaScript
so let's move on to the Javascript file
first here's a JavaScript file now we'll
access all the HTML elements here in the
Javascript file because we need them so
what we'll do is we'll write here where
blue car is equals to
document. get element by ID so the ID
for blue car
is blue
car we'll write here
where red car
document dot get element by ID so the ID
is red car for the red one next up we'll
write here where a result we'll get
result as well we'll write here document
dot get element by ID and inside this
we'll write result fine we are accessing
all the elements with the help of get
element by ID method now what we'll do
is we'll write here where score
so the score will write here document.
get element by ID and again we'll write
here
score then we'll write here
where game document dot get element by
ID the ID for game is game
fine we'll take another variable here
let's say the variable name is variable
counter to count the number of cars
passing through the red one to get the
final score basically so we'll
initialize the value as zero for this
counter variable now the next thing we
have to do is to make the blue car move
randomly in three positions right for
that we'll use math. random function
again we have used this function
previously in the Flappy Birds game so
we'll write here blue card. add event
listener We'll add an event so we'll
write
here animation I ation so this is a
predefined event listener in JavaScript
so for this we'll create a function here
we'll write here
function and we'll Define the function
as well fine so we'll take a variable
let's say
random and we'll write here math dot
floor math.
random so this is a predefined function
in JavaScript we'll write here into
three and right here we'll write 130
fine why 130 because 130 is the default
width which we have taken in a CSS file
so we'll write
here blue car dot
style dot
left is
equals to the value of of random in
pixels
fine then we'll increase the value of
counter after every car passes through
after every blue car passes through the
red one save it and move to the browser
you can see the blue car has three
positions over here can either come from
the left right or from the center any
random number from these three numbers
will get multiplied to 1 30 so we have
three positions only any random position
let's say the position is one it means
that the car is present at the left so
that particular number will be
multiplied with 130 and the left value
of the blue car will change to that
particular number the logic is simple if
the number randomly taken is two then
the random value will become 260 in that
case and the blue car will have a
distance of 260 pixels from the left
side of the container
so this was the reason behind taking the
width of container as 390 I hope you
guys can relate to it now so let's move
ahead and write the code for moving the
red car as well so you can see the red
car is not moving as of now we'll make
it move so let's write the code for that
as well we'll move to a Javascript
file and we'll write
here window. add event listener We'll
add an event here
we'll write
here key
down and we'll Define a function here
fine so we'll take a parameter inside
this
function now what we'll do is we'll
write here
if e
do key
code is equals to is equals to
39 then what will happen is
we'll take a variable where red car
left is equals to we'll write here
parent window
dot
get computed
style we'll get the computed style of
red
car and we'll write here get
property value fine we'll take the
property value here as we'll take the
left value so we'll write here
left and we'll write here
if red car
left is less than 260
pixels
then red
car dot style do
left will change to red car
left plus
130 and the value will change to pixels
as well fine now we'll write the code
for another key as well so we have to
add two keys over here what we'll do
is we'll write here
if e do key code
is equals to is equals to
37 this key code over here represents
the left and the right arrow key of our
keyboard so that's why we are using here
key code AS 37 and 39 39 is the default
key code for the right arrow key and 37
is for the left Arrow key so what we'll
do here is we'll write here where a red
car left is equals to parcent so what
we'll do is we'll copy this from here
and we'll paste it here
fine this will remain the
same now what we'll do is we'll write
here if red car left is greater than
zero then it will change the style so
we'll write
here this and here what we'll do is
we'll change the value of red car to Red
Car left minus 130 pixel so we are
moving the car to the left or to the
right
fine now we are done with it now save it
and move to the browser and now here you
can see we are able to move the red card
to the left or to the right as well fine
now we are good to go so the next thing
we have to do is to write the code for
Collision of these two cars or we can
say the function for game over as well
fine so let's head back to our
Javascript file and we'll create another
function over here so what we'll do is
we'll take certain values and pass them
through some conditions if any of the
requirements fail then the game is over
the logic is simple let's implement this
logic so what we'll do is we'll write
here set interval so we'll use the set
interval method and we'll write
here function so let's say the function
name
is game over
will now Define the body of this
function now let's discuss some things
what we need is we need the top property
of blue car we need the left property of
blue car and then we need the left
property of a red car fine so we'll take
three variables we'll write here
where blue car
top then we'll take
where blue car left and then we'll take
where red car
left fine so we have these three
variables over here now what we'll do is
we'll write we'll get these values first
so we'll again use the get computed
style property and the get property
value we'll write here par and inside
this we'll write window dot get computed
style so the computed style is of the
blue car then we'll write here get
property value we'll write
here top because we need the Top Value
we'll do the same thing for blue car
left and for red car left fine so we'll
change the values here we'll write here
left for the blue car left and we'll
write
here left for the red car fine we are
good to go we have these three variables
and we have the property
right we have the value of these
particular properties now we'll write
here certain conditions we'll use the if
statement again we'll write here
if blue car left is equals to Red Car
left let's replace this left with a
capital
l and we'll write here and then blue
card
top is greater than 2
250 and blue car top is also less than
450 so we need the blue car in between
250 and 450 for Collision right what
we'll do
is we'll write here result
dot style dot display so we'll change
the display property of a result element
we'll write here is equals to block now
we need a game over C over the game and
we'll also change the display property
of game as well we'll write here game
dot style.
display as none fine we don't want the
game for this now the next thing we'll
do is we'll write here score so for that
we'll write here score do inner
HTML is equals to let's say it says your
score four
is and we'll write here dollar we have a
variable counter right we'll print the
value of counter here fine now there is
an error over here you can see so what
we have to do is we have to put them
inside this we'll not use the double
inverted commas we'll use this instead
and you can see the error over here is
gone now so we are good to go now after
that we'll change the value of counter
to zero again in case the user wants to
restart the game the value of counter
will start from zero again now we want
to call this function after a certain
interval of time so we'll write here
10 and we are good to go so the set
interval method will be called after 10
milliseconds now the same thing we did
for Flappy Birds as well so some
conditions here are almost same and the
output is also the same as we had for
Flappy
Birds now save it and you can see on the
browser that our game is completely fine
now it's working totally fine so we can
play this game now let's play it once so
here you can see we can move our red car
and the blue car is coming randomly from
any of the three directions it means
that it can either come from the left or
from the center or from the right fine
on Collision you can see it shows that
the game is over and the score is 13 now
on clicking the restart button we can
restart the game the page reloads again
and it's working totally fine now we
have to create this particular game and
we can see that the game is completely
done we can play this game anytime and
it's fun as well of course so we can do
certain things with the graphics as well

It's lunchtime, and this is
Brad Anderson's lunch break.
Here in Redmond we're visited by
some of the smartest people on the planet,
pretty much every day.
And every chance I get, I
meet up with them for lunch.
(upbeat cheery music)
Today I am meeting up
with Microsoft veteran
and industry icon Kurt DelBene,
the Executive Vice-President of
Strategy and Operations at Microsoft.
(light jazz piano music)
I know you're a big car
guy, you build cars,
- [Kurt] I am a big car guy.
- [Brad] You raise cars,
- [Kurt] I do.
- I don't know why I'm driving,
I should have you drive.
- Well, you should.
- [Brad] So do you drive something
like this every day to work?
- [Kurt] I gotta tell ya, I drive a Prius.
(both laugh)
- I don't know if everyone
knows this, but we all know you,
my kids know your last
name because they have seen
all the commercials of your wife,
you know, who's one of our Congresswomen.
- [Kurt] Hey, it was my name first,
that's what I tell people.
You know the benefit of that is
now people know how to pronounce it.
- [Brad] Yeah, you know, your
wife is obviously in the game
but you're no stranger to politics either,
I'm sure you're probably
too humble to say this
but what was it like to get
that phone call that says,
'hey you know Kurt we need to
come and save healthcare.gov'.
- [Kurt] It came actually
at the breakfast room table.
I saw the New York Times article
kind of going through the issues
and I said to Suzan, this looks
all completely preventable.
And she then asked the magic question:
'well would you be willing to help?'
And I said, well...
- That's where the question came?
- That's where the
question came originally.
And then literally just
a couple of weeks later
I'm sitting in the Oval
Office and the President said
'I unabashedly beg you to do this'
and I learned later you don't
even go into the Oval Office
unless you are planning on saying yes,
so I guess I gave the right answer
but it was an incredibly
rewarding experience.
I love building software
but the ability to kind of
get people healthcare
and know that the system
that you're building is helping people
in that direct way was just, it was great.
- [Brad] You know, so
you've had Obama as a boss
and you know you have
Satya as a boss right now,
who was better at playing basketball?
- Oh that's an easy one.
I don't know, I thought you were going to
ask me a tougher question than that one,
that's got to be President Obama.
- Who's better at cricket?
- Well that's got to be Satya I suppose.
I don't know, the styles
of those two leaders
is different, I mean I
briefed the President
about every week when
I was doing the work,
- [Brad] Wow.
- [Kurt] He's a funny guy, and probably
one of the biggest differentiators,
obviously Satya's highly deeply technical
and the President was learning.
He kind of got a crash
course with healthcare.gov,
no pun intended.
But I was sitting in the Roosevelt Room,
we're getting ready for the final push,
and I'm describing to him how
we're looking at dashboards every day,
we're looking at all the indicators,
seeing when they'll tip over,
and he says 'oh so Kurt, it's just like
Star Trek isn't it, we need more power'.
And he actually says it,
and I didn't know what to
say, I finally just said
'Yup Mr. President, it's just like that.'
(Brad laughs)
Yeah, it was a fantastic experience.
The thing that's amazing
about him is one: after this,
and I think it's true of
government forevermore,
these IT systems are going
to be absolutely critical
to the success of their agendas
and that this was a turning point
in our industry where that got learned.
- [Kurt] And I said, you
know Nathan it seems that
people don't want a fax machine
with a touch screen on it
they just want to hit
ten digits and hit send.
And his response was, well at Microsoft
we don't look at market
research, we just know.
- And contrast that now...
- Yeah contrast that deeply now,
we have come a long
way since those points.

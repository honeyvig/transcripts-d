hey everyone i am weber khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
backtracking algorithm we shall begin
our session by introducing backtracking
then we will discuss the end queen's
problem to understand the backtracking
in detail
after that we will implement the end
queens problem in the code editor
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply
learnt's youtube channel so without any
further ado let's get started with an
introduction to backtracking
backtracking is an algorithmic method of
alternately
solving a problem
to explain the issues it employs a
recursive approach backtracking is
required to find every possible
combination to solve an optimization
problem
backtracking is used in solving various
problems like n queens knight store the
rat in the maze problems and so on
now to get better understanding of
backtracking let's have a brief look at
and queen's problem
let's say we have four by four matrix
we have to place four points in that
every row and column has exactly one
queen and none of them falls under the
same diagonal
we will start with the left most column
then we will check our base condition
that if we have placed all the queens or
not
now we will try every row in this column
if we found a location where the queen
can be safely placed then we will mark
it as a part of an answer
and then we will recursively check if
placing queen here will lead us to the
solution or not
if yes then we will return true
otherwise if false then we will
backtrack and try other rows and repeat
these steps
if all rows have been tried and nothing
worked then we will return false to
trigger backtracking
now let's implement this end queen's
problem in the code rater
we will define a vector
inside a vector
it will be a end vector
result
now we will write a utility function to
check if the queen can be pleased on
board
so
it will be a boolean function
bull is safe
as argument we will place a vector
inside a vector
and
board
comma and
row
comma
and
column
we'll define
and i comma j
and
n
will be equals to board size
now we will check if this row on the
left side
so
for loop
i is equals to zero
i less than column
i plus plus
f
board
at row
i
then we will return
now we will check upper diagonal on left
side
so for
i is equals to rho
comma j
is equals to column
j greater than equals to zero
and
i
greater than equals to zero
i minus minus
comma
j
minus minus
f
board
i
comma j
then return
now we will check lower diagonal on left
side
so for
i equals to rho
comma j
is equals to column
i
less than n
and
j greater than equals to zero
i plus plus
comma j minus minus
now if
at i
and j
will return
else we will return
basically what we have done in this
function is we have checked that row and
the right diagonal and the left diagonal
so that no queen can overlap
now
next we will write a recursive utility
function to solve and queen's problem
so
pull
solve
thank you
its argument will be vector
inside a vector
enter
ampersand board
comma and
column
now we will first check our base case if
all queens are placed
so int
n is equals to
board
size
f
m
is equals to n
then we will define a vector
and
b
so for
and
i is equals to zero
i less than n
and i plus plus
another nested for loop
and
j is equals to zero
j less than n
j plus plus
f
board
at i
j
is equals to
one
then
v dot push
back
j plus one
now
we will print result
dot
pushback
and we will return
true
now we will consider this column and try
placing this queen in all rows one by
one
so
boolean
plus
is equals to false
now for loop
and i is equals to zero
i less than n
i plus plus
now we will check if queens can be
placed on board i
can call them call
so if
is safe
bored
my i
know
if it's safe then we will
place this coin at the position so board
i
call
is equals to
1
now we will make result true if any
placement is possible
so
res
is equals to
solve
and cube
at
board
comma
call
plus one
or
rus
now if placing queen in board i call
doesn't lead to a solution
then we will remove the queen from the
board i column
and backtrack
board
now if queen cannot be placed in any row
in this column then we will return false
so
return
plus
now this function solves the end queen
problem using backtracking
it is basically using solve enqueue to
solve the problem it returns false if
queen cannot be placed otherwise returns
true and print placement of queens in
the form of once
now there may be possibility that there
are more than one solution
then this function will print one of the
feasible solution
vector
add a vector
and queen
and
n
result
dot
clear
now we will call vector
inside a vector
board
and
comma
vector
and
bracket n comma 0
now if
solve
nq
at board
comma 0
is false
then we will return
empty set
otherwise
we will sort
result
begin
mama
result
and
and we will return
result
now we will write the main block
so end
n is equals to
4
so for
vector
inside vector
and
v
will be equals to n queens
at n
so we will write for loop
auto
are we
we will call c out
then for loop
auto
atr
ar
c out
itr
and see out
and then we will return 0.
now let's run this code
as you can see we are getting two
answers
now this end queen can be solved with
both of these answers
now let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned in this session
first up backtracking is simple to
implement and has fewer lines of code
most backtracking codes are composed of
few lines of recursion
function code
next
since we use recursion the function
information is stored on the stack which
has high space complexity
next when the branching factor is
significant it is very time consuming in
many cases
finally many problems such as knight
stewart
and queens rat in the maze subset some
problem and so on can be solved using
backtracking

hi everyone welcome to the session at
connect on Azure functions
my name is Ansari and today I'll be
speaking to you about what Azure
functions is how you can build your very
first serverless function and all the
capabilities we provide to help you
develop publish and monitor using visual
studio code so let's get right to it I
do want to talk about what Azure
functions is at its core as your
functions is server less compute that is
the ability to run custom code on demand
and at scale in the cloud
whether it's written in c-sharp node
Java or even Python you give your code
to Azure and will manage and run it for
you all dynamically based on events and
to help you accomplish this we provide
various options for integrated
development using tools such as Visual
Studio we as code maven Eclipse or even
just a cross-platform CLI today we'll be
looking at one such example for
functions using vs code so let's get go
ahead and get started
let's take a look at how anyone can get
a function up and running in just a few
minutes for this I'll use huius code and
the azure functions extension so here I
am in huius code on my Mac and I've
already got the azure functions
extension installed since I'm logged
into Azure I can see a list of
subscriptions that I have access to the
functions extension enables us to create
new function projects add new functions
to that project and even publish to
Azure directly from within we S code
just at the click of a button
so let's go ahead and create our very
first function once a picker directory
will be presented with a menu of
languages to use to initiate the project
for the purpose of this demo let's go
ahead and pick JavaScript
and so what this did for us is
initialize the functions project with a
couple of files namely the local and the
hosting configuration now we can go back
to the azure functions extension and add
a new function to this project
again we'll be presented with a menu of
templates that we'd like to use to
create the function interestingly these
templates directly correspond to the
triggers available to us to execute the
function let's go ahead and pick HTTP
trigger provided with a friendly name
and secure the HTTP endpoint with a
function or an API key so what did this
do for us going back to our directory it
created a new sub directory with the
name we gave for the function with a
node script and a function JSON
configuration file looking at the node
function it consumes an HTTP request
input and parses the contents of that
input to find the name property in the
body of the query string it then uses
the name property to construct an HTTP
response which is returned back from the
function you can see the function JSON
configuration describes the HTTP request
input and the shippi response output
binding right here within function JSON
now that we have our function we can go
two ways either we can go ahead and
publish to Azure and trust our fate for
it to work out of the box as it is or we
can use the open source functions
runtime to debug and test locally and
the great thing is that we as code
enables you to do all of this simply on
the click of an f5 in fact if you've got
the node extension installed you can
even go ahead and set breakpoints in
your code to debug and look at the call
stack now let's take a look at a
slightly different function here I've
got a node function that triggers off a
message or an event received on an IOT
hub it then grabs the contents of this
message and
out puts it to the console now that I
have my function I can go ahead and f5
into it to test locally and I can also
go ahead and deploy this function to
Azure so let's take a look at how to
publish the app I can go ahead and pick
a subscription and create a new app with
a unique name let's call it connect demo
and then we can pick a resource group
for this function app as well as a
storage account to contain the contents
of the app and the files
and now that we have our function app
provisioned we have one more step to
configure any settings or secrets for
the function app picking the
subscription again and here's our app
now these settings while running locally
are saved as either environment
variables or properties in the local
settings file for a function to connect
to IOT hub we'd configure the IOT hub
connection string that we can now go
ahead and provision as an app setting on
the function app and once we have that
we're pretty much ready to go ahead and
test our application running in Azure
for this will connect to the streaming
logs for our function app again picking
the function app and we can go ahead and
start seeing the application inside
slogging and to simulate these events on
the IOT hub I've got an app that will
register multiple devices and start
sending notifications to the IOT hub and
we should notice shortly that our
functions started to pick these up and
output those events or messages back to
the console and that's it we developed
an end-to-end service application tested
a locally published it to Azure and even
looked at the monitoring logs right here
from within a local instance of vs code
with Azure functions we strive to keep
improving developer experiences and
provide support for the languages and
tools that you're most familiar with so
you and your team can be more productive

look forward to helping you with your
service mission thank you

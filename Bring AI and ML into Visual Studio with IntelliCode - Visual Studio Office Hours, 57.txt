good morning everybody and welcome to
this week's episode off the visual
studio remote office hours my name is
max Kristensen and I am delighted that
you are joining us here today because we
have an exciting show for you we're
going to talk about machine learning and
artificial intelligence intelligence
rather inside visual studio because we
actually have some inside visual studio
and what does it do how does it help us
and what will it do for us in the future
these are all great questions that we're
going to look into now I will give you a
little update on my home office because
I kind of do that every time here's my
latest little gadget that I bought this
is a USB speaker you can see there's our
cable here that is just up on my
pegboard here on the my work bench so if
you go there's a picture of what it
looks like today this morning so if you
go check out my Twitter you can see what
that looks like but this is basically
like a ten dollar USB speaker and it's a
hell of a lot better sound let me tell
you then then sort of a laptop slowly
getting into a more professional estate
here in my very unprofessional home
office so with that out of the way let's
say hello to our two guests and so Katie
why don't you start by introducing
yourselves hi my name is katie and i am
one of the program managers for visual
studio in tellah code i'm looking
forward to this conversation today
awesome and mark hey yeah i met you and
i have worked together for a long time
I'm a program manager I've been a
program manager on Visual Studio for
like 12 years something like that now I
don't know I'm getting too old and now
I'm working with Katie as a program
manager on the Intel akkad team been at
this for like two and a bit years now
and thoroughly enjoying it so looking
forward to chatting with all the folks
about what we can do with AI
fantastic yeah I think mark I think the
first time I met you you were the
program manager for the visual studio
editor just the editor itself that built
with you know syntax highlighting and
intellisense and all that sort of stuff
so this is this is quite some years ago
I guess so for the people that are
online please remember that you have on
your right side of the screen you have a
Q&A panel so that means that you can ask
us any question you like anything for
mark and Katie about machine learning
and AI inside Visual Studio but you can
ask any question about Visual Studio and
you know with three people here that
works on the visual studio team there's
a good chance that we were able to
answer that so just keep the questions
coming and we will answer them as we go
along okay let's get into it so mark I
know that you're on the year while
you're both on the intel eco team and
i've heard a lot about Intelli code I
think I know what it is but every time
we talk I learned that it is more than I
think it is it happens every single time
like it's expanded the role of the
machine learning is is doing something I
didn't even know that it used to do and
stuff like that so things are moving
quick it seems like but what is in
Teleco can you kind of give an overview
of what it is and how we use the machine
learning and AI yeah for Angelica glad
to do it
I mean you know I've been at this I say
I was looking back a bit yesterday and
realizing that I've been playing this
game now for two two and a bit years
working on Intelli code and we first
previewed some stuff way back in 2018 a
build but we've we've really kept the
same focus all the way along right so
from the start we were looking at ways
that we could use the power of the
machine to delve into your code as data
and the things wrapped around your
coders data and present back to you
based on the kind of wisdom that it
harvested and distilled down some useful
insights right some useful insights that
can actually help you to do your job in
in a more effective fashion and so when
we talk to customers when we talk to
developers we found that you know there
were various areas where there were
struggles in their you know their
development life
and they for instance you know they
might say well I'm coming at an
unfamiliar API I really don't quite
understand how to how to use that API
but I could really use some assistance
or actually and and this is a
conversation we've been having more
recently i'm reefa miller izing myself
with an api i don't quite know what to
do you know i'm really trying to get
myself back up to speed again whilst
using this thing and i want to be
effective and so that got us into
thinking about how can we do better
in terms of not just the completionist
but other places too in terms of
presenting the right stuff to you so
helping you code with confidence right
so that you can actually get right into
something and the machine can help you
out by presenting the things that you're
most likely pattern choices right so the
power of pattern is really a big theme
across the whole of intel acade right
that machines can do stuff now can delve
into patterns that they were simply not
able to do a few years ago okay and all
of our code and all of our things around
code what I kind of call code metadata
all of that stuff is like a substrate
there's a big scientific word for you
but you know just a place where things
can grow or where we can grow that
insight and and bring it back to you
right so that's that's really the the
founding insight was that we believe
that that machines can grab grab those
insights and bring them to you at your
point of need and then we talk about you
know how that can help you out when
you're trying to find issues so think
about anti-patterns think about things
where you your your team has done a
great deal of work perhaps to to go
ahead and fix some problem that's
actually a common auntie patent that
keeps coming up in every single flippin
code review and it drives you nuts and
what about if the machine could spot
those patterns and put those fixes out
there for you so that you didn't have to
keep reminding everyone in every single
code review that'll be neat wouldn't it
and so we talk about that as being kind
of how we can help you find issues
faster and then we talk about focusing
your review so you heard a little bit
yes there about how is code reviews can
become messed up with a whole bunch of
repetitive tedium we were looking at
ways that we can relieve that pain as
well but all of this it comes down to
the capacity of machines to learn huge
things across giant substrates that
would be really hard for a human to
learn and bring those useful insights
back to you right
you need them that kind of makes sense
yeah I think that's that's really
helpful so you know it reminds me like
10 years ago when I first started on
working on Visual Studio at Microsoft I
had this white board in my office and at
the very top I had written in big
letters the thinking IDE and the idea
was that an IDE should be sort of
anticipating your next move and make
that as seamless as possible and it was
sort of a pipe dream and it was more
like a vision or more like a Northstar
to shoot for but what you're talking
about is seems like that it seems like a
way that we don't have to deal with this
sort of trivialities or the mundane
things of programming we can go straight
to solving the problem that we were
hired to do and there's worry about like
I guess like formatting and other such
things in a code review that seems
trivial right exactly so and and it
doesn't have to be restricted to the
trivial either that's the thing so you
know these can be reasonably complicated
things I mean we got some stuff to show
you later that's that I think you'll
find fun that will help you find
actually cut complicated things and
repeated patterns that you know you
maybe wouldn't even have had time to
spot and might have bitten you on the
posterior later on and you know that's
that's something we we want to make sure
that you know we let the Machine loose
on that kind of stuff as well so it's
not so much just the the mundane and the
repetitive but it's also the stuff that
is too big for you to wrap your head
around because you just don't have time
right and we'll talk a little bit about
that yeah maybe a bit later when we talk
about suggestions all right so that
makes good sense so it's both the
mundane and the complex so mmm when when
Intelli code first was introduced he was
it was doing something in my
intelligence it was augmenting the
analysis and in the beginning I didn't
really know what to make of it like I I
it was you know my cheese got moved
something changed the intellisense had
looked a certain way for like maybe two
decades or something it was different so
what happened there and how how did how
did that solve problem how do how do
I guess I my big question is how and why
did you do two intelligence of what you
did and can you explain what it was that
you did okay sure I don't know if you're
still hearing me okay cool so yeah so
what what we did was we actually learned
and trained on open source repos and we
learned just like the common usage of
various classes and what you're seeing
sort of as you see those autocomplete
pop-ups is you're seeing sort of what it
what are those like top views or most
used or commonly used types or or
functions or methods for that class so
it really allows and enables developers
who may not be quite familiar or might
just forget or not recall what is the
right function or the right method to
use in a certain circumstance it allows
you to sort of provide it provide you
with sort of contextual method recall as
you're typing so this is very very
helpful for a number of scenarios so
imagine if you're a developer who's just
onboarding to a particular class or
namespace this really just sort of gets
you sort of helps you sort of assist you
as you're as you're typing is also super
valuable for even those more seasoned
developer who might have not used a
particular class in a long time or might
just be you know not super familiar with
like an internal library for instance
with one of our other features team
completions and sort of gets you sort of
set without having to navigate to the
web or have to navigate to stack
overflow
you just have everything at your
fingertips okay so that's really cool
yeah the it seems like being able to
figure out how to use something based on
how other people use it
is pretty much what we do when we go and
Google something right and or we go to
stack overflow to find out like how do I
use you know this method and this class
from this library that I just installed
but now that's just that's just right
there in my intellisense list and that's
and that's all coming is that all from
github or is there any other sources to
that and how do how do and how do you
determine what sources to choose from
okay so we determine which sources to
use so there right now are our base
completions model which you're seeing
you know as you start typing in digital
cedar versus video code that is based
off of open top open source repos and so
those are the repos that hope have over
a hundred stars so we we've done a
couple things so we've trained our
completions model based off of this
learning of these open source repos so
like seeing these top repos and just
learning from those but we've also sort
of curated that learning so we've we've
actually it's a supervised learning
model where we're we're actually like
saying which ones are the top even
within those top repos what are the top
most use types or classes within those
repos to ensure that you're getting the
contextual usage not just sort of like
the methods or properties that are used
just broadly they're getting sort of
like a more intelligent or more catered
sort of experience or tailored
experience so I guess to answer your
question Mads this is what we're
providing for the user is not just sort
of a comprehensive dictionary of methods
but sort of providing them with the
right methods the right properties to
use at the right moment and when they
need it so we don't want to provide you
everything we sort of want to just
provide you what we believe you'll
actually what will be useful in order to
enable you
to be productive at the moment when
you're trying to use it okay that makes
sense so I don't know maybe it was like
a year ago I came to I came to you mark
and I said hey you know visual studio
extensibility is a kind of a complex set
of api's so if you've ever tried to
rewrite a business to do extension you
know that all the you guys there maybe
not so well documented and it can be
hard to find out exactly how to use them
so I went to mark and I said hey can we
can we in takes a bunch of sample
repositories and github and other apps
that use these so that we can give
better intelligence using those machine
learning models for all these API and
and Mark was so kind to say of course
and you know what did it take two weeks
or whatever and boom it was there in the
product and everyone benefited and we
actually made it so that Intelli code
was now I optional but recommended
component when you installed the
workload for Mitchell three
extensibility so I think that was an
example where we took we saw there was
an itch problem granted it's an itch
it's not the biggest space in the world
right Visual Studio extensions but we
were able to like tailor and optimize
the machine learning for that so mark is
that possible if people run their own
nougat packages they have some users of
those newbie packages can they also ask
that you indexed to improve their users
experience for there is that a thing
well there's a couple of answers to that
question
Matz and you know I want to start from
the top one of the first things we kind
of heard from people when when they
started to use these that these new
starred in Telus and suggestions was
exactly what you've said it's like hey
you know I use this library or that
library right but it's not super common
right just exactly like what you were
talking about with these extensibility
not you know it might not reach the bar
of being in enough of the open source
github repos for us to pick it up and
the
in what Katy was referring to as our
base models right so how can we solve
that problem and for some libraries
absolutely where there's there's usage
out there we're happy to hear from
people and ask your asking us to put
certain library sets into our base
models and that can be a very effective
thing for us to do if we know where
there's great samples to be had right so
we can train on it pretty much any
github repo if it's open and so if we
know it's important you can point us at
it and we can go at it and do exactly
what we did for the various
extensibility space but I think I'd want
to ask Katy to talk to us a little bit
about some of the things that are going
on for cases where it might not be
something that's for everybody but when
it's more about your own internal code
bases and you've got internal classes
and stuff like that right so that's the
other problem that comes up right once
people get hooked on this stuff right
and what we what we've heard from people
is that they kind of like getting these
stars but they were upset that they
weren't getting them for other classes
they were commonly using sometimes those
other common classes are actually in
your own code and and Katy I don't know
do you want to have a bit of chat about
what we're doing for that sure mark yeah
so so what mark is referring to is a
feature that we call team completions
and so as Mark was mentioning you can
currently get Intelli code start
completion suggestions for like from the
base model just as you're typing so it's
sort of predicting what you're gonna say
what what's next but that's based off of
common usage and that common usage as
Matt and I were talking about earlier is
based off of training on open source
repos or the top open source repos but
what if you're working in an internal
library or you're working on code or
tight or four types that aren't commonly
found in open source repos so what do
you do and so for us we have now enabled
team completions and team completions
not only like augments that sort of base
completions model that Mark was
referring to
with your custom types that it
automatically also shares that with
everyone who has access to your codebase
so so that is the super cool part of
like let's say that you're working on in
a git repo and I want to train a team
completions model so I get dice so I can
get those start completions for my own
types well once you do that training
you've also shared that with with the
rest of your team automatically anyone
who has access to that git repository
automatically gets all of those the
start completions for those unique types
which i think is is super super cool so
yeah I think that combined with the
context of your code you can just
imagine as as you're typing and as
you're developing you're starting to not
just code faster but you're also just
sort of being assisted along the way so
you can sort of stay in that developer
flow with having these start completions
okay so if I have an open source library
for instance or a nudey package that
people are using can I then do this team
completions for my own for my own set of
API so whatever that I've developed and
then whoever has access to my github
repository will also get the benefit of
those completions is that is that what I
hear Katey repository let's be very like
it will be specific so for right now
we've enabled this for just get
repositories and so it fits on github or
if it's an azure dev ops and it's a it's
a get based repository then yes you can
have a manual training and then that
once that that manual training that team
completions model will be attached to
that repository and shared with the rest
of your team
however there was a part that you talked
about a nougat package and that's
something that we have on our backlog
and we've been thinking actually very
recently about but we have not enabled
attaching team completions models to
NuGet packages yet or those are those
libraries so we do have that in our mind
that we as a top scenario the nailing
library owners to be able to train a
team completions model and then
distribute that with to the rest of
their you know library users it also
vice versa we also have the idea that we
love for a library user to be able to
train for a nougat package and then you
know with the consent of the nougat
package owner of course be able to
distribute so we are actually planning
on lining that up but right now team
completions is just scope to get
repositories and I don't know I think
that mark might actually have something
to add here yeah so I mean Katie's
really put it pretty well there the the
game is a little bit different so
because at the moment Mads you could
come to my office or someone could send
me an email right or send Katie an email
and say hey I really really want my
package to be included or my set of
packages to be included those can get
included today in the in our base model
so we have a way to do that for for
things that we think are important but
obviously that's kind of not gonna scale
to the sheer number and variety of
packages that are out there and so as a
package author as you were saying you
know you can't really like we can't have
every package author be banging on our
door and saying hey can you include me
in the base model also that kind of
doesn't scale out well in in terms of
having the the base model getting bigger
and bigger so what we really want to do
is to make sure that you know if you're
consuming a base model sorry of a no
NuGet package rather you get the right
map of the right model for that package
but that requires all the things that
Katie was talking about to be solved in
order to solve for that we need your
consent as a package owner to go train
we actually need something that you may
or may not have which is usage right we
need sample usage of your code and
that's that the model really only learns
I spidering across usage not so much
looking at the API itself but looking at
how people use that API and in all the
different contexts that it's used and
it's most useful when all of the
contexts are expressed in that learning
data so it's it's not as easy as it
sounds and it's a problem we really
desperately want to crack as Katie says
it's on our backlog but we haven't got
there yet and I'm super interested to
hear back you know if there's anybody
who's got packages right now what what
I'm Katie and I would be loved to be in
touch with you about about what that
feels like in terms of what would you
your ideal workflow be how would that
fit in with you would it be just like
that you when you publish your new get
package the work of doing a training
gets done automatically for you and
somehow gets pushed up and how do you
see that playing out for you would that
work well would there be something else
that you would want please you know all
of this stuff's only gonna work if we
can get all of the ecosystem people who
are actually playing the game in on how
we're doing it yeah so I guess the whole
scaling thing makes good sense of course
it wouldn't scale if everybody's
packages were was in the base model that
makes total sense so and scaling is a
hard problem to solve I don't envy come
up with a good design for that one yeah
fortunately Mads the sorry
fortunately match the there's an
existing piece of scaling called new get
write which basically lets us scale
packages right so we're keen to follow
the patterns that package managers give
but we just want to layer ourselves up
and on top of that as much as we can
that's how our minds are on this at the
moment and but if people want to kind of
tweak our minds on it we're more than
happy to have discussions about that so
if you watch this live please give us a
comment in the Q&A panel on your right
side or if you're watching this on
demand on YouTube comments are below
please please help us get some insights
here for mark and Katie
so just to change gears a little bit you
are
doing Intelli code which is the
originally was the augmentation of
intellisense and you know but it's
become more like and as I said in the
beginning every time I asked what are
you working on there's always something
new and different than what I thought it
was going to be so beyond completions or
that's what we internally call Intel
sense completion what else do you have
going on in your team right now what
else are you tinkering with mark Wow so
I mean there's there's so much so so
much and we're you know that when I look
at the horizon of what we're looking to
do with right we're really trying to
help developers to you know I say beyond
completion some of these things are
actually just extending completions like
so for instance you know we're doing
some work to make completions even
better in places where they're not to
extend their scope but we're also doing
stuff and Katie was kind of alluding to
how did developers learn how do they
understand there are lots of steps so
there's a time for instance when you
don't even know what API or even what
library it is that you want to use and
typically right now you're going to be
out on github it's not get up on the
Stack Overflow or being or name your
search engine of choice here you're
going to be out there searching for the
solutions to different problems however
but if your goal is a code snippet why
wouldn't that be inside vs another one
that we're looking at is looking at
repeated patterns and you know how we
can help you with with that so when
you're editing I don't know if you've
ever come across this scenario you know
Mads where you'll you introduce
something new into your into your code
you're doing some refactoring somewhere
and you know you then have that really
tedious task maybe you've introduced to
help a function of going ahead and in
introducing that in all the places that
it applies in your project or maybe even
in other projects and particularly if
that helper function contains you know
functionality that fixes a bug you might
even if you forget to introduce that
helper function somewhere you might be
having hidden bugs parked in your codes
that you haven't fixed or maybe your
team's developed a new pattern for doing
something that helps avoid some trouble
you know maybe you've got a particular
way of dealing with certain threading
constructs or you know you've got a way
of catching if blocks and the convention
for the way you throw exceptions and
blah blah blah blah blah you know teams
have these things and they have them for
a reason they'd learn these things by
grazing their knees and by by actually
doing stuff and having trouble hit them
and then the team gets together and they
figure out some solutions but the real
trouble comes when they want when you
want when you want to make it basically
codify that and make sure that you don't
miss it missed opportunities for it in
other places and that's where the power
of the Machine comes in to help you out
to help you figure out where those
locations might be so if I can I'd like
to share a teeny tiny demo how that
might work so cueing your screen and
I'll get it up just bear with me for a
moment and I will share my visual studio
let me know when you're seeing my screen
yep there you oh I'm just in the middle
of Visual Studio right now this is just
a preview release and this is a feature
that we call in Telugu suggestions and
so what's actually going to happen here
is I've got this crufty code here which
does a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
and I'm just going to go ahead and
replace it because I've got myself a
helper function that actually does that
for me and now I've got to go through my
whole program and find all the places
where that might apply and that's you
know not necessarily an easy task
because you know the variable names I
use might be different there's some
slight changes of formatting so a
straight-up Find and Replace might not
do this but what I find is you might
have noticed as soon as I finished that
second instance there something has
happened okay and over here I've got a
new thing okay it says showing Teleco
suggestions based on repeated edits it's
been watching me as I go okay and we'll
talk a little bit more about how that
works in a moment but then watching me
as I go and when I click on that thing
there I see that it's saying okay
there's another one of those
at line 124 I double-click on it and
here's another light bulb and it
suggests the exact fix that I need based
on the pattern that I was typing ok so
if I take that sure enough it's fixed it
for me ok so you can see what's going on
here I'll just stop sharing my screen
now and we can talk a little bit about
how that works say the magic there
underneath the hood was a thing called
pros now pros is a little bit different
from your standard
machine learning and AI based things so
what Katie was talking about with the
base completions and the team
completions that we've gotten into those
things are all based on a machine
learning algorithm or an algorithm that
works across the relatively large corpus
of code and learns the bunch of patterns
based on it sort of after the fact in
frozen code if you like that code is
actually you know learns across at one
moment in time what you saw there was it
was dynamically learning ok and what
prose was doing was it was tracking my
ast my abstract syntax tree deltas ok so
it looks at my code and it says ok when
Mark was typing that thing this kind of
change occurred and it was like it was a
tree that looked like this and then it
turned into a tree that looked like that
ok so it was able to deal with the fact
that the variable for instance the
variable names were different and some
of the constructs might be different
because of that ok it looks at those
deltas and once it finds some common
ones it tries to synthesize up a
transform program that lets the user get
that fix that I was showing to you so
the thing that takes you from before to
after that's like a transformation
program or a synthesized suggestion that
is made by example by clustering ok
those deltas in the ast S as I go and
having learnt that rule ok then it can
apply it anywhere in my code that I open
up so that's pretty natty
I like it I like it a lot because it
actually is learning we've talked about
how it learns from the you know kind of
wisdom of the broad community in terms
the work that we have incompletions and
then about how we can learn from the
wisdom of the narrower community on your
team when we're talking about team
completions but now we're talking about
learning from what you type what
individuals type and then you know
eventually we're thinking maybe we get
that that knowledge out to the team as
well wouldn't that be cool if those
rules that we found was something that
we're actually a transferable asset
wouldn't that be any idea anywho this
this is something that's just it's a
different kind of learning so we're
we're not hung up on the idea that
everything we do has to be a I in the
conventional sense of that word that it
has to be learning across a large corpus
is that it has to be using big fat
models and or even slimline models we
will do anything to have the Machine
find a pattern for you and help you
apply it at the right point of need
that's the that's the real key and so
that second piece that you saw there is
an example of how we're doing that with
pros with with Intel occurred
suggestions and folks can if they want
to try this out they can try this out in
any of our recent previews so go
download the 16-6
preview bits right now and you can you
can try this out just go to the IntelliJ
preview box and turn it on it's it's
really easy to to try out and we'd love
to hear the feedback on that but that's
one of the things that we're playing
with as a team is to to try and expand
the kinds of learning that we are
willing to take on alright so you bring
up a good point
the latest Visual Studio preview which
is 16 6 preview something and but
Intelli code also works for Visual
Studio code right so how do so okay how
does people go get the business to do
code 1 and is there a benefit one over
the other are they or are they the same
it sure so the benefits of Visual Studio
versus Visual Studio code honestly I
think it's a matter of preference so I
think that there are a number of
developers who are accustomed to using
Visual Studio and in Visual Studio right
now the feature that I mentioned
previously team completions
right now we've only actually enabled
that for a c-sharp in C++ within Visual
Studio so if you're trying to if you're
deciding whether or not you want to try
to completions right now if you are on
vision of the studio code we haven't
actually expanded there yet it is on our
roadmap
and in our backlog but right now if
you're a c-sharp or C++ developer and
you'd like to have custom completions
tailored to your code base you would
have to be on Visual Studio however we
do have base completions so getting
those starred completion suggestions for
JavaScript typescript like right now we
have C++ and we also have I'm probably
blinking on Python and probably blinking
on a couple equals equals amel yeah so I
think that's about it Samos equal Python
JavaScript typescript C++ we have that
available in Visual Studio code and the
way to get that is you would actually
have to go to the visual studio
marketplace so like the visual studio
code marketplace and you'd have to
install that Intel extension and you can
also do that directly in Visual Studio
code so the other thing I would say is
that we also our preview feature that
you can actually try out in Visual
Studio preview as like Marc suggested
previously and as Matt sort of alluded
to you can try out all of our latest
features which we tend to not always
focus on visual studio but a lot of a
lot of our PDS have sort of started in
the digital studio but you can go to
visual studio and you can access a
number of our our preview features there
so yeah so I don't know know if there's
a which one is better
I think it is a matter of developer
friends and what you are accustomed to
working in I do think that visual studio
does offer like a very more
comprehensive experience and if you are
familiar with setting up your developer
toolkit their toolset there we just sort
of augment that experience all right
very cool so when I see mark what you
just showed and other things that I've
seen until the code do it's like you
know it's close to magic and you know
and I realized I also don't understand
sort of a mental and AI concepts very
deeply and so there's a saying by
someone that if you don't understand it
it's indistinguishable from magic but
what is what kind of reactions do you
get out there for for people using it or
seeing it for the first time what what
what do you hear mark well I mean it's
it's interesting you know it varies from
shock and the magic response to how on
earth is it doing that to suspicion
sometimes like I'm not sure how it could
do that or why it would do that but you
know one of the things I think we're
always trying to be in the interrogate
team is kind of humble about the the
technology that we are using and you
know it's not always perfect because
these things are you know based on
algorithms that you do not always
produce perfect results with a hundred
percent certainty we always want to say
that the things that we're producing are
either a suggestion or something of that
sort and the reason why is because we
don't want to want people to think that
this is like it's not like static
analysis so if you think about the and
even that can get it wrong of course as
we've as if you've been around static
analysis long enough you can know there
are false positives there but if you
think about the suggestions code that I
just showed you there the amazing sort
of ability to spot patterns does it get
that right a hundred percent all of the
time no it does not but what it does is
when it does get it right when those
suggestions are good they essentially
end up being something that can be
almost like the analyzer you didn't
- right okay it's it's basically because
no not many people have taken the time
to go and write a linter or an analyzer
or something of that sort but when we
can actually do this right for you
we can really add value and so we're on
a delicate balance between trying to
make sure that you know we surface the
suggestions that are useful to you so
for instance in that suggestions code
one of the things under the hood that's
going on there that we learnt quite
early on is we really want to make sure
that even AST suggestion Delta
suggestions that we get that might be
true in terms of the transforms you know
they may actually be a correct
observation but that which which
increase the number of errors in your
code those things we don't currently
suggest it may be that they're valid and
it may be that in future we actually
have so a bit more control over that and
say actually I'm perfectly happy to have
my code to be in a broken state in an
intermediate and you know that when
you're editing sometimes that happens
right that you're you have to go through
broken to get to good um but initially
in terms of making this useful to people
we've beefed up the sweet spot was that
we need to make sure we don't cause
suggestions that would make the code
break now you know that's gonna change
over time but you know in terms of
reactions from people people generally
don't react well to suggestions that
make their code break unless they know
it's going to do that unless they know
what the nature of the thing they're
applying is so you know that's one of
the things we've heard but and that's
part of what's gone into you know the
suggestions set up as it stands right
now may be the year but also that that
notion of humility in terms of the
suggestions that we make I think you'll
always find that so for instance if you
think back to the intellisense example
intellisense will show you everything
that's type valid for the location that
you're you're typing okay when you do a
method or a property or an argument
those things if they're valid code then
intellisense will show them to you this
is it the pre Intelli code into other
sense right it will show them to you all
we're doing is kind of sprinkling some
some recommendation sugar some
suggestion sugar on top of that right
and making it say Oh
but we think given your context you
might want to do that and notice I'm
using think and might they're we're not
saying you'll definitely want to do that
we're saying you might want to do that
so it's very important with these a I
assisted tool so that we we make sure we
understand that and that we express that
in the kind of experiences that we
surface so I would say that's that's
been true across everything that we've
done so far and I anticipate it probably
stays that way yeah
so it's not like a moment in time like
the AI technology has just not evolved
enough to be more that we can be more
prescriptive saying this is what you
want to do so right now we're just
saying oh maybe this is what you want to
do and we suggest something but it's
that just because technology hasn't
caught up or I don't know I don't know
that that's actually ever gonna
completely go away it's because there's
such a broad spectrum of things that are
possible to express you know we get more
precise and more confident and we spend
a lot of time obsessing about precision
and coverage which are two key metrics
that we we measure all the time and
really precision is about how often we
get it right and coverage is about how
many places we can get it right and so
the those things are things we bothered
we are deeply bothered about we want to
drive that number higher so that we get
we cover more stuff and we cover it a
higher precision that's always goodness
but getting to a hundred percent is not
necessarily our goal being useful is our
goal right being useful to the developer
and helping them to you know move
forward faster that those those are the
goals that we care most about right that
reminds me of like it's sort of a mantra
that we have here in my family is like
never let perfect get in the way of good
yeah so much good to be had and it
doesn't have to be perfect to add a
tremendous amount of value yeah
so I've heard like some people be a
little bit concerned about AI right like
is he gonna take my job like where are
we in you know with the AI and machine
learning inside Visual Studio like are
we getting closer to being able to
automate the
as a whole as a discipline maybe what
are the sort of concerns that you hear
from people and and what are your
answers to them Katie so I'd love to
talk with Mark about this too because I
know mark and I talk about this a lot
but from my perspective you're so far
away from that as a discipline and I
think that as Mark was highlighting in
his biggest comment I think that like
we're really the goal of what we're
trying to do and embedding or
integrating AI and machine learning
techniques into visual studio vision
studio code our main goal is to promote
common usage and sort of promote those
those common practices best practices
and we're at the point I think in the in
the juncture and the grand scheme of
things I think we're very very nascent
and we're at the point where what we're
doing is providing just helpful
contextual examples so that's what the
completions Dunne's
that's what suggestions as you saw mark
demo previously that is what that is
doing is providing suggestions that
really just sort of like help you remain
in the dev environment and and help you
sort of like keep in that flow that
developer flow and not get distracted by
going to you know the web and like
searching this and then seeing those
shoes that you've been wanting to
purchase or seeing that you know $10 USB
speaker that you're like I want to get
that it helps you keep focused on the
task at hand
and I think we're just we're we're
really far away from automating people's
like deb jobs away and i don't even
think that that is a goal that we ever
actually intended to to reach our goal
it has been mainly just like how do we
enable developers who already are sort
of like a very valuable resource how do
we keep them
to just keep them focused on on whatever
their task is how do we enable them to
be as productive as they possibly can
and not productive or you know you know
the the man or like the business but
being productive for their own selves
like how do we actually provide them
with the tools that as they're learning
development and onboarding to coding
that they're actually able to see this
as like this is actually a fun task
there's some sort of like ludic
engagement aspect to like just actually
just development so I think from our
perspective that's sort of our spin but
I'd love to like have this conversation
with mark as well so I know mark has you
know is you know very much like on the
edge of the sea to answer all right
bargain let's hear it yeah I would this
is this is the heart of where my head's
been for the last couple years you know
that this is not at all about taking
away people's jobs and and and as Casey
says I mean even technologically we are
far from that but it's just not what
we're about we are about enhancing the
experience of development about making
development yeah I mean I dare to say
fun right to actually make it less
painful and less difficult to stay in
the zone to stay in there I love the
word ludica one of my great heroes was
Bill Hill by the way who sadly passed
away and that that notion of ludecke
engagement encoding that notion of being
you know I'm locked into this space I'm
thinking about so if I don't have to be
distracted away to some other place in
order to go and figure out what I'm
doing I can stay in the zone and the
tool just helpfully augments me right
helpfully augments me in there at the
right moment with the knowledge that I
couldn't otherwise get it's giving me
superpowers
basically it's giving giving me
superpowers by saying I can now as a
developer know for instance all the
patterns that I have out there that my
team has has developed so I don't have
to worry about tripping over that banana
skin whilst I'm in the process of
figuring out how to it how to implement
this great piece of technology that I'm
actually implementing my head's about
the technology it's not worrying about
those other things that I might be
missing
or you know let's imagine and and I know
you know maybe I'm just getting old a
little bit but here's the thing we know
a lot of api's but we sure as heck
forget all of api's as well so I don't
want to have to be going back to the
documentation to reboot myself into the
zone when I hit that piece of code that
I haven't touched in three years right I
want to be able to know what the common
usage is right now so that I'm not you
know losing my context losing my vibe
really we want to make development more
pleasurable we want to give developers
superpowers we want to give them that
capacity to get more done not just
because it's kind of good for business
but because it's good for the soul
anyway
Katie Katie I'm sure you want to come
back on that egg sure Mike yeah mark
yeah I really wanted to actually like
sort of segue this into something that
aunt Ella code provides so an example of
how we're actually trying to make
development more more helpful and also
more pleasurable as Mark was mentioning
is that they're trying to like reduce
the arguments that are had over very
like you know sometimes you'd think like
trivial things like for example your
code Styles that happens all the time or
formatting so do we have the tab or do
we have like two spaces or like three
spaces are four spaces and and things
like that are often just like fights or
venomously place but conversations that
go on for way too long
that actually distract from your ability
or door detract from your ability to
actually just code so how do we actually
solve that so I'm actually going to
share my screen and show you an example
of how we're actually trying to pay
developers and development teams from
having these sort of back-and-forth
arguments about code styles and and code
formatting
you
okay so as you can see my screen I've
loaded a solution and and the feature
that I'm actually going to demo is a
feature called and bird editor config so
if you're familiar with editor config
files an editor config file is a
cross-platform file and there is a
common syntax defined syntax that sort
of defines sort of the code styles and
code formatting conventions that exist
within a solution our project so
typically what developers would do is
they would write an editor config file
what happens if you're in a team and you
don't actually know like you you just
sort of you have this project you don't
actually know what the styles are
actually already exist there but you
have sort of like some people have
opinions how about you start from
instead of having opinions why not start
from and analyzed like an analytic and
analysis of your current code base and
the current code conventions and the
current code styles that exist there and
then from there like determine what it
should be and have those very meaningful
like bring the data to the to the
conversation or the debate so so what
you can do is you can actually add a new
editor config file that Intel code but
it's all code will do in the background
is it's actually analyzing that solution
and it has now generated an editor
config file so instead of having to go
and define all of these rules and
intelecom is actually just defining this
for you so if you if you see this is
what aunt Ella code has produced in the
editor config file so I've already
opened up a file
it's called paint object constructor and
something that you'll notice is that
you'll notice here that it's suggesting
me I've already sort of like loaded up
the line I'm sorry but it's suggesting
that I actually take an action and
actually make a fix and that is based
off of
the define coding conventions and that
have been defined in the editor config
file that Intel code has already
generated for me on my B on my behalf
and so because this lives in the
solution so you'll see the editor config
file here once I commit this this will
automatically be shared with the rest of
my team and so as you can tell I could
actually introduce this but I can
actually take action on this suggestion
but I also wanted to show you that what
is the actual rule that is providing me
with this suggestion and if you'll
notice if you can if I can go down there
there is a rule that says that you
prefer methods that we practice with
this and and so I guess what I'm trying
to say is that the scenario that is this
would be very very impactful for and
useful for is a scenario when I'm in a
team and we just have had a lot of
conversations back and forth about what
should be the common style or the common
coding practices for my team and often
they just people are bringing their
opinions to the conversation and based
off of their own history but why don't
we take the code as the main artifact
and we say here's how
here is how after I've analyzed our code
base these are the styles that are
already exist within my codebase or
within the solution within this project
and from there then bring this to the
conversation and say Intel code has
generated this editor config file that
is based off of what exists the styles
that exist in my my code base in our
code base let's actually see if like do
we actually want our code base to our
code to look this way or do we want to
have do we want to change it in a
different way so this it actually not
only promotes just sort of common or the
best or the comment or the historical
Colston Co styles but also gives you
sort of like that starter for that
conversation and it also reduces that
time that you're going back and forth
about debates you did just say this is
what the codes this is what sort of
exists commonly in our in our code
do we want to exist differently do we
want it to be different and the cool
part about it is once you've actually
have this as a find editor config it
fits is c-sharp in this case the
Rosalind analyzer will start providing
you with warnings and pushing
suggestions for you to change that is
pretty cool okay so in Teleco does
editor config formatting as well so it's
really a broad set of features that your
team is doing so is it fair to say that
Intel ecoute is is not a feature it is
more like a team that work on certain
type of problems market yeah that's
absolutely right Matt we we work on the
the set of problems where we believe we
can bring this kind of pattern
understanding to bear to give you good
useful productivity features that
augment your developer workflow right so
we're all about that so we're in a sense
where a set of a I assisted development
tools that we're trying to apply across
a broad spectrum whether that's envious
or envious code whether it's to do with
things that are happening at edit time
whether it's to do with things that are
happening even as Katie was just showing
you know that editor config artifact can
play out at CI build time as well so you
know we don't really mind where we add
the value as long as it's helpful to
developers and helping them to
accelerate but our cool thing is to
distill down the pattern wisdom and
bring it to you to you at the point of
need right so that's that's our motto if
you like to to try and get things done
that way yeah so we're not just one
thing we're not just about intellisense
we're about anytime we can provide you
with helpful insights based based on
patterns that's that's the deal okay so
so you're mentioning this but you said
that the like you're basically doing a
lot of work up front and then you
present it to the visual studio user as
they need it does that mean that the
overhead of running the machine learning
and AI engine doesn't happen in real
time
on the developer machine CPU and
takeaway performance that is an awesome
question and in fact the answer is
complicated so in some cases the answer
to your question is yes we offload for
instance in creating those machine
learning models and one really exciting
development that we should talk about
actually is that we've been doing some
enhancement of the completions model
with with with deep learning those
things are high horsepower activities
right that we want to we want to make
sure that we keep those things on the on
our service so it doesn't gum up your
machine right we were we don't want you
to be having to run learning locally if
you don't know if you have to but
sometimes we we do a little bit of work
on your local machine it really were
trying to optimize that as much as
possible and the training where it's
necessary to do training happens on on
remote machines where the big horse
their lives or we keep the training
process or the the algorithm to a point
where it can learn very very efficiently
so you saw when I was doing the
suggestions work that yeah when I was
typing away there there was analysis
going on you know as I was typing as it
turns out that that algorithm is running
locally on the user's box and and we've
done a lot of work to make sure that
that actually remains highly efficient
in terms of memory usage and CPU usage
so that we don't swamp you and don't
take away from your your editing
smoothness right we don't want to be
doing that we don't want to be
flattening your battery we don't want to
be doing any of that kind of thing
particularly in these days when we're
working remotely more you know you've
got to be laptop friendly right and that
the reality is that you know it's horses
for courses as we say in England right
we you basically you pick the right the
right tool for the right job and so when
we are doing things that are extremely
complex and when we need to do things
like do deep learning models and so
forth chances are you're gonna find us
doing that on a server somewhere on your
behalf so we don't eat your machine CPU
and battery where it's appropriate we
will sometimes do local work as well but
we will always work hard to make sure
that the
it's not something that's gonna impact
you too badly so kind of not a simple
answer but you know hopefully it makes
sense yes thank you so much
it totally does and it's wonderful that
we can get great AI capabilities without
users using our battery on our laptops
so okay we are almost at the end and I
want to just end this with a quick
question to both of you so let's start
with Katie Katie what is it that excites
you the most for the future of Intel the
code that you're going to work on in the
foreseeable future
with luster she's muted
there's such a great question that's
yeah that's such a large question um
what most excites me so I have mainly
been focused on the completion space and
so for me there's a number of goodies
that are uh parsley use that I will wait
to present on those or talk about them
too in depth but I will say that I'm
very excited about working really
closely with some some early customers
who are just interested in dog booting
and figures and just like learning from
them about these upcoming experiences
that were working on so I'm being very
coy and not being very forthright about
what we're working on but I will tell
you that it's really really exciting and
in the completion space and I'm looking
forward to just learning and hearing
from our customers about these new
experiences because I think that they
will really sort of take what we're yeah
so I think that it will be great yeah
awesome and Mark same question for you
yeah absolutely I mean customer customer
input is supervisor to us and and I'm
really interested to hear other places
where people have tedious tasks that
they would like us to take out of their
way but I'm personally you know very
excited about the ways we're going to be
able to spread out the knowledge that
that's in your team and get that out to
everyone in your team so they can take
advantage of it I think that's that's
going to make a huge difference to
people as they go forward and we've
definitely got some good things you know
coming in that domain and and also new
ways for developers to express their
intent in a more compact way so you know
whether that's by you know typing
something once and getting us to do
something again or or whether there are
just other ways to say what they want
the machine to do for them I think
there's lots to be done in that space
and watch this space we have lots to say
it build so come
watch out talk better as well awesome
well thank you so much both Katie and
Mark for for joining me year's a day I
hope the viewers out there had a good
time and learned something new
I assured it so so thank you so much
we're at the other line it is it's been
an hour and I hope I'll see you again
next week Thursday morning at 9:00 a.m.
Pacific time where we will talk about
the UX lab that we have here in
Microsoft that we use in Visual Studio
to interview customers and see how they
do eye tracking and and learn a bunch of
cool things and how we apply that and
what are some of the learnings we have
from that when does it work and when
doesn't work really well and I think
there's something in that that you can
apply as well at home so make sure to
tune in next week thank you so much

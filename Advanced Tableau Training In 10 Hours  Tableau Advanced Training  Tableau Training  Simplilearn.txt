hey everyone welcome to Simply learn in
today's session we will be learning the
advanced Tableau Concepts so we will
start off by learning the a brief
introduction to Tableau followed by that
we will understand the data connectors
in Tableau then we will learn how to
create data extracts in Tableau then we
will look into tablet calculations like
aggregation and Tableau and other quick
tablet calculations followed by that we
will get into the data visualization
part of w which includes charts reports
and dashboards then we will also
understand some data manipulation
operations in Tableau parameters in
Tableau and followed by that to
implement our learnings we will go
through some of the top projects in
Tableau for your data analyst portfolio
and to make things interesting we will
also cover the most frequently Asked
Tableau based interview questions and
answers for data analyst profile so
without further Ado let's get started so

and also if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learn Sports project program and
data analysis from code University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details on this
course click on the link in the
description box below and on the pin
comment with that in mind over to our
training experts now in order to learn
Tableau at the basic first step is to
import a sample data so in our case what
we have done is we have imported a
sample Superstore which is in Excel
format a sample superstore.xl which has
three worksheets in it orders people and
returns
so by importing this data into Tableau
first of all we will create
relationships between these sheets in
order to identify who all have placed
orders and how many people have returned
the orders we will do some analysis on
the orders placed by certain set of
people and Order returned by a certain
set of people
now as we have imported uh the sheet we
will make certain joins so the first
step is to drag the orders
table the order sheet on the
relationship canvas here okay and you
can see the data sample data the first
100 rows over here
okay then now we need to create an inner
join with people's table between order
and people okay so if you see
it has automatically detected the field
names on which the inner join has to be
created so on the order side you have
region and on the right hand side which
is the people data you have also a
region okay so both these columns are
common and that's how we have made a
join between orders and people data
so if I close this box and go and check
the people's data
foreign
so see the region and the person these
two columns from the people table have
now been
joined with the orders table right so it
means that these are the orders in a
particular region which has been placed
by
in this region
let me show you the sample Superstore
Excel file now this is the structure of
the file you have a sample list of
transactions basically the orders which
are placed by customers
across multiple regions
south west of USA South Region west
region then you have a list of order IDs
which have been returned so basically
the order ID in the returns sheet
matches with those orders in the orders
table
and then you have the people
sheet in which you have region
and a person associated with that region
the sales person associated with that
region okay so basically when we are
combining joining orders with people we
are joining that
which orders
belongs to which region and who's the
sales person associated with it so what
we have done over here is we have made a
inner join means all the orders should
belong to particular region and that
region is in the people's sheet
and then in the second step
now we will make a
left join between returns and orders
not inner join we'll make a left join
between returns and orders and we will
make a join using the
order ID
okay so just edit this
click on left
and
select order ID as the join column now
what does left join means left join mean
is that consider all the orders from the
orders table and only consider the
orders from the returns table which have
data means which are returned otherwise
show null for the order IDs which are
not returned so if you see this is the
these are the two columns from the
return statement and these are null
because this is relevant to the order
IDs which are not returned okay which
has been accepted by the customer but
these are the orders for which you see
data in the returned and Order ID column
it means that these have been returned
now with these joins in place please
save your book and now we have our
relations created in the
um
in the Tableau now we are ready to
create certain reports and extract
certain kpis using this relationship
model
now we'll move to sheet 1
okay
and first we will place
state
and person on the rows
sheet okay
then
I'll go to my
numbers and
put the profit or the super State per
person how much profit I am making as a
company okay this is my goal to check
now sort by highest to lowest so
California is giving me the maximum
profit of seventy six thousand six three
hundred eighty one then New York then
Washington so this is the sorted order
in which I have
listed my profit in descending order
now I can also check what are the number
of orders
placed
and check the distinct count
so out of 120 out of the total orders of
127 okay so this is the number of total
number of orders which have been
returned for California is 127.
it's 16 29 so the sorted order is as per
the revenue as per the profit and this
is the details of the orders which have
been returned per state
so if you see for connected for a Kansas
there are zero returns
so you can also extract data
table to refresh his orders and identify
new rows using order D so as and when
new data is being added you can
refresh it now say extract
and now you can save this information
profit
by state
and click save so this is the extraction
of this particular report which is
possible in tableau
so this is the first exercise which we
have completed for
reviewing and analyzing the profit per
state highest to lowest and within that
per state what are the number of orders
which have been returned by all the
customers the distinct count of order
IDs which have been returned
now let's start our second exercise on
creating calculated fields in tableau
now in this exercise we will be doing
certain
activities like we will be creating a
set to show the states which have more
than 100 customers then we will be
creating a calculated field to show an
average sales per customer okay then we
will create a calculated field to show
the sales goals and then show emerging
and developing stage so these are the
four kpis which we have to derive
now the first thing we have our sample
Superstore data already imported and the
relationships created in a join with
people and left joined with returns
now we have our sheet 2 in which we will
create the states a list of states which
has more than 100 customers
so what we have to do is we have to
click right click on the customer name
and click create set
okay
now we have to give the name as states
with 100 plus customers
and then go to the condition tab
select by field
and then apply condition as
count of customer name
greater than equal to
100
and click
okay
now we have this set created states with
100 plus customers
now to determine average sales by
customer we have to now create a
calculated field
so go to the analysis and click on
create calculate field
okay
now name it as
average
sales per customer
and now we will see average
we will use a
okay so we are saying that per customer
we are using a level of definition
function include which means that per
customer what is my average sales right
we've already used a function aggregated
function called average so we are saying
per customer give me the total and then
give me the average per customer so
we're going to click ok
now create another calculated field you
can also create from here and name is as
name it as sales goal
now in this we are going to type the
formula if
minimum
States
with 100 plus customers equal to true
then
sum of
sales
into 1.3
else
average sales per customer into
100 so me we are saying that
if the customer belongs to the set of
states with 100 plus customers then the
sales Target should be
1.3 times the actual sales as of today
else it should be 100 of the average
sales per customer
now let's create another calculated
field which we call as
emerging
or developing state
if distinct count
of customer name
is greater than equal to 100
then
the state is tagged as developing state
else it is called as
emerging state
okay so we have now
three calculated Fields average sales
per customer emerging or developing
State and sales goals
now we will use this in our reporting
so we will drag sales goal under the
columns
and then I'll drop my state
so now this is the statewise sales goal
depending whether the state has 100 plus
customers or not
then add your customer name
make the measure as count distinct
and make it as discrete
okay so if you see this
we have the count of customers per state
and the
the sales goal
for that particular state
and now
I'll put my sum of sales the total sales
which I want
which is there per state
okay
now go to show me and select
this particular chart
bullet graph
now to bring sales goals to column right
click on the sales access and select
swap reference line fields
now from your left hand panel drag and
drop emerging or developing straight on
the color panel
okay so emerging state is the orange one
and the developing state is the blue one
and save the sheet as
developing and the emerging States
so if you see this it's an emerging
State because its count is less than the
customer count is less than 100
its sales goal is
57384 but the actual sales is
19511 okay
so now this is a developing State its
count is greater than equal to 100 and
its sales goal and its sales is exactly
the same it matches so that's why you
are saying the bar and the blue bar is
ending exactly where the vertical bar is
foreign
so what we are trying to depict is that
whether the state is going Beyond its
Target sales goal or it's behind it
and you can see that using this
particular vertical bar like for example
Michigan its sales goal is 71 952 but
its actual sales is seven six seven two
seven zero average sales so that's why
it is be above its Target
and it's a developing state
because it has more than 100 customers
so you can even sort
by the count of
the uh customers higher to lower so all
your developing state will group from at
the top and the emerging States Will
Group at the bottom
or you can sort by
the sales goal
so the orange bar is the sales goal or
the blue bar so depending what sales
goal
has been
derived for each state
so let me now begin with connecting to
data
your topic
we are at the end of this lesson you
will be able to
understand how you can connect to
Tableau Data server you will be able to
differentiate between a join and blend
how can you perform a join on a data how
can you blend a data we will discuss the
various connection options available we
will understand how tablet server Works
in terms of the ecob Ross authentication
all right uh we will understand various
performance optimization techniques as
well Shadow extra extract as well as
different methods that we can prepare in
terms of the data that we want to
analyze all right so let me begin now
the very first topic which is uh
connecting to tablet server so I'm going
to first take you through a couple of
presentation slides here and then
quickly move on to the environment where
we will actually then start exploring
the topic so
now when you want to connect to a data
source in Tableau server it's pretty
simple you can connect to a flat file in
your loopy machine so one is you will
click on to the server in the start
screen and uh you can specify the server
name you can specify and uh show your uh
login your credentials the username and
password and based on that you can
perform the you can have your connection
to the database all right so that's how
you can connect to the tablet server as
well all right so
that's the very first basic so the
Tableau administrator is the one who
assigns the roles and creates these data
sources all right and you have uh
Tableau has the facility in order to
import different forms of data for the
analysis for your ease and once you're
connected to the taboo server then you
need to select the taboo server data
source on the data menu you will need to
select the data source to download a
local file a local copy you can select
and create a local copy and then you can
also duplicate a duplicate of that data
source will be added up into your data
window so that's how you can connect to
Taboo server as well all right and it
basically promotes various features
wherein uh you can then connect to the
taboo server for your data so you are in
this example you can see that you're
able to connect to the taboo server as
an admin and connect to the sample
Superstore and it downloads it creates a
local copy and duplicates all the data
in that particular data window
that's how we can see the sample
throughput source and you can connect to
the server uh next we are going to also
understand what is joining and blending
so before I move on to the presentation
slides here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move on to the environment
directly let us start exploring these
blending and joining features uh right
there in all right I'm going to simply
just clear all these sheets that we have
and
um let's go back to the connective data
source window all right now in terms of
uh this is where you're able to connect
you can see the Tableau server so it's
through the server that you can connect
with and you can specify your server
credentials and you can click on connect
and uh based on that that's how then you
can provide the credentials and uh log
in all right now I do not have a server
or a connection where and I can show
that example but this is how you can
click on any of these servers you would
have to type in the URL click on connect
and then provide the usernames and login
provided and that's how you can connect
to your data source using a server
option all right I'm going to show you
the file option wherein you can connect
to an Excel and let us discuss the join
and the blending parture all right so
let me click on
it says we have the sample support uh
data solo and in this when I'm pulling
order all right I pulled in the four
sheets so there are three sheets in that
particular Excel file when we pull an
order this is how now you can identify
that whatever are uh these are the
header names these are the dimensions
and measures that's how it's getting
identified if you can notice all the
dimensions are first place you have all
your measures then you're able to
identify the data type and the role on
ABC which is a contextual value or
numeric value that means it's a
dimension with a pound sign what kind of
a data role is it estabros automatically
identifying each of these rules as well
all right even in the metadata that's
how you can see the field names the
field uh name that you want to see onto
your table onto uh your view and the
table from which it's going to be
getting pulled in from in this you can
rename in case you want to change the
particular name hide it uh Alias it will
describe it
all right so this is how you connect now
connections is where you have the option
to connect between knife and extract now
if you connect to live that's
interconnected to this particular sheet
live that means any update happening
onto your uh sheets any kind of updates
on the sheet there is a light connection
it will automatically update your views
as well onto your sheets that you're
creating and in case if you select on an
extract all right this is what it means
that it allows uh what it does is it it
Imports that data into the Tableau Data
engine first in the data engine where
it's going to perform the queries it
will create an extract and based on
these we can then start using the
connections all right so what it does is
it disconnects it's more like a small
extract more like a cube if you
understand it in that manner taboo
creates an extract of that file
providing you a disconnected whether it
allows you to give you a better
performance a better query
uh that's how you can then work on and
start creating uh and working on these
extracts now you can refresh these uh
extracts at a timely manner as well so
that is what the Tableau extracts are
but it extracts it as a copy of the data
uh and saves it in the engine and that's
how then the performance as well gets
better in terms of using where you can
connect to your particular data all
right so you can work with uh multiple
data sources data sources can be of any
type all right wherein you can edit from
the number of lists that you can see it
can be a flat file a server file as we
saw or the saved one and we can also
then join multiple tables within the
data or we can also blend when it's
coming in from different data sources
and we can also perform a blending so
let me first show you an option for join
now you can see we have the order table
law when I drag and drop the people uh
sheet as well here you can see that
Tableau has automatically created or
join all right it has automatically
created a join when we have pulled in
two tables coming in from the sheet and
by default all right we have the inner
joint that Tableau creates so it creates
a inner join here wherein again you can
then click on the join option here and
you can specify and modify the join
based on whether you want it as a inner
join which is a default you want a left
joint now if you see the right join has
been disabled here okay I will show
these options here by default the right
join is uh disabled by a tableau by
default by default and to enable that
you will have to uh connect to your
Excel sheet in a different manner I will
show that your shortly so that's how you
can change and you can perform your
joints this is where you can explore and
show The Joint cloth and here again then
you can specify like you can see a join
that's been created amongst the data
source which is region and region people
among these two data all right it's also
showing you the join and whether it is
uh equal to or not equal to all right so
you can connect to multiple tables and
based on that you can add in tables you
can specify the different joints and
based on that then when you click on
sheet uh you will then be able to see
that there is a joint being performed
there are two tables now the people
stable also that has been added in and
it has now performed and you know joined
on our data and you can start using this
particular option so let's say I'm going
to pull in the region on my columns and
I'm going to have my sales onto my rows
it's now providing me uh details of my
sales at a regional basis now let's say
I also want to to analyze the people
belonging to these regions depending on
the color so it's going to change the
colors based on the central East South
and West all right that's how these are
uh the people the number of people
belonging to each region that it has
identified so that's how it has taken up
the region people as you saw there was a
showing that was created and it's giving
us that particular option and based on
that you can see here we just have uh
this particular data source here and
that's how you can see now I've used it
earlier as well if you remember we had
put in one particular table hence the
blue tick mark sign here enables and
shows us that this is the primary data
that's being used now this comes in
picture when we're using a particular
join so let me right now just um uh use
this particular detail here and we're
not going to require this all right so
let's just close this we just need one
right now because discussing on blending
I'm going to show you the blending part
later right now we're discussing on
joints so uh that's how you can join in
your data sources and you can combine
multiple Fields using these joints so
when you have when you have multiple
tables you can simply connect to the
data let me go back to the data source
page uh this is a startup page the data
source page and you can see the joints
has been performed now let's say you
want to create a join where you want to
force due to certain situations and
scenario where you want to post or write
out a join all right or right join or
for that matter you want to write a
custom
now you're not able to write a SQL right
here in the in the drag area pane where
you can drag and drop your sheets from
the Excel file or any kind of a file
that you're connected to for that and to
enable the right join you will need to
uh connect to your data in a specific
manner so let me open up a new instance
of Tableau here
and let me show that to you as to how we
can enable the right choice and how we
can have our custom sqls as well so in
case if you want to write in a custom
SQL on our view then how can we perform
that initial custom SQL all right
okay so let us connect to our data here
and I'm going to take you on to the
Excel file now when I click on the
samples Super Store here okay uh what we
have done is we clicked on open and
that's how we opened up the uh file all
right and that's how we could see the
sheets now instead of using the open
option directly what I'm gonna do is in
the drop down right here instead of open
we have an option that says open with a
legacy connection all right this is what
is going to enable us to write a custom
SQL where we can specify a query rather
than using the entire data source or
pulling in the entire table so quick
clicking on the second option in the
drop down in the open uh tab here you
will be able to see the open with Legacy
connection I'm going to uh so ensure
that you've selected that and that's how
you will then connect to the data source
and with that you now have a new custom
SQL option that's opened up for you all
this is where you can once you've
connected you can double click on the
new custom SQL and you can write in your
query you can write in the SQL where you
want to perform the query and pull in
your data all right you can have your
select from
and let's say
orders
all right so that's how you can perform
and you can write in a custom SQL and
you can pull in the required data you
can have your required table that you
can pull in in terms of creating a SQL
that you want to pull in or and have
your data on right so you can have your
select from the
overdose and
preview the results
so here you can see the order table has
9994 row we have a preview of the data
available in that particular uh sheet
that we pulled in all right and we can
now parameters is what I'm going to
cover when we come on to that particular
topic so I'm going to leave this for now
so that's how you can write your custom
SQL and you can click on OK and that's
going to pull in your entire data and as
you can see now instead in the earlier
view I'm going to just switch to the
earlier instance of Tableau you could
see that you could see the name of the
table that I dragged and pulled in you
could see the name order but in case
when we write a custom SQL then it gives
us the name which is written as custom
SQL query all right and this is where
you can get the information you can edit
the query in case you want to change the
results and requirements so that's how
instead of clicking on open you click on
open Legacy connection and you can have
your own custom SQL defined now along
with this all right when you open and
when you click on a legacy connection
when I drag in the people's table here
you can see that even the option for
right joints have now been enabled so by
default Tableau disables the option for
right join and in case in certain
situations and circumstances you want
the right join to be enabled you win in
the same manner have to import and
connect
and you will have these right join which
is going to be enabled there for you all
so you can have your custom sqls or the
right joints in that case which gets
enabled and you can use a custom SQL or
a right join right so that was custom
SQL then uh joining is where you can as
I mentioned identify and choose between
the Clauses and the Clause that you want
to add in right now let me show you an
example of blending as well so I'm again
going to open a new instance of tableau
all right and uh with that I'm going to
show you the example of blending so
let's say you have uh you want to join
in and when is the best time when is the
best way that you should use now joining
it when you have all your multiple
tables that you want to join coming in
from one data source blending would be
required when you want to join in uh
multiple tables coming in from different
data sources or for that matter you can
also blend even though the tables are
coming in from a single data source
there might be instances that you might
want to have still perform a blend
instead of a joint so let me show that
option to you all right so let me
connect to the data
let's connect to excel pull in our
sample supersole file that we have we
have the order tables all right and I'm
going to go on to these sheets here all
right so we have one order we have one
data which is the order table now I am
going to again click on add a new data
source coming in from the same Excel
file and this time I'm going to have the
people's table
and move to the sheet so now if you
notice we can see two uh data sets here
which is one for the orders and one for
people here and uh in here now this is
where the blending will will take place
this is where you will have a blend
automatically when you pull in a view if
there is a common view that comes into
picture now let's say I'm going to first
pull in the order date onto the columns
all right
and as soon as I pull in you can see
that my order table has now got a blue
check mark which has become a primary
data source all right and now let me
pull in sales onto my rules
and from people let me have
uh from the people's table let's have
region pulled in and added to the color
so region has become a secondary data
set and now you can see a blend sign
right a linking or data blending that
has automatically been performed on both
these two data sets all right that we
have the order table and the people's
table blue being primary and people uh
which is being secondary in this case
all right so that's how you can mention
now in terms of blending what happens is
you cannot specify the joints here in
this case there is a primary and
secondary data and it is automatically
blending in the data for you it is
automatically pulling in uh the data you
will not be able to your select on the
kind of join you will not be able to
manipulate the joints so that's how even
though at times you have the same tables
that are coming in as I mentioned there
are times where you might want to
perform and change the joints so that's
when you can use the joining table
option that comes into picture so that's
the difference between your blending and
between joining the tables
right so uh you can see this available
link and you can see how it was simple
to drag a particular View and uh pull in
data and your as well region has been
added to the color pin because of which
the Legends have been created identify
all four regions present in the data and
it's also letting us know here in the
marks that region is coming in from the
secondary table you can see the orange
ambotic marker and that's how you can
identify that region is coming in from
the secondary table that's been created
all right in terms of uh connecting as
well wherein you can combine and half
the joint uh enabled now depending on
the kind of data all right going back to
the data source depending on the kind of
tables and the kind of data that we have
that's when we can enable and have the
joints that we can decide on all right
so one is you would require and need to
have
multiple uh Legacy connection with which
you can then Define the right outer
joints all right and that's how you can
proceed and have additional uh joints
that you can work on
uh we also discussed how we could create
and connect to a custom SQL query all
right and uh that is how we could using
the Legacy connection uh also enable the
right outer join wherein we could then
perform a right join on our tables as
well all right and in case if it's a
query then it gives them the name of uh
the query uh as a custom query which is
what we saw onto the review and the
extract there all right now in terms of
extract all right now extracts are
basically your saved subsets of the data
source which will help you in improving
the performance so instead of as I
mentioned instead of being connected to
a live connection it is better that we
select an extract which creates a subset
and stores it in the Tableau engine
wherein it performs the queries and it
takes advantage of this functionality
where it is not connected to the
original data source and with this it
can actually reduce the total amount of
data in terms of defining and limiting
it so that's how you can create and
extract and let's say uh once you've
created an extract you can then perform
like I said you have the edit option
where you can edit the additional
detailings you can allow an incremental
fetch happening where then you can
refresh the data each time or your data
is updated you can provide an
information page so this can help you in
improving your performance you can take
advantage of the functionality in terms
of the data source for uh using the
discounts or the this thing counts as
well and moreover it's more like an
offline mode you're actually accessing
your data as an offline access where
it's not directly connected and you're
able to use it like a data or local data
all right so that is the difference
between a live and an extract so that's
how you can make use of the Legacy
connections as well so let's go back to
the presentation slides and have a recap
now
um
these are the joining tables that's what
we discussed that in terms of the tables
that we have we can join our table and
we have various joints available where
it makes it easy for us to uh analyze
the data that we want to review we can
join to multiple tables and based on
that we can customize the inner the list
the right or the full outer join now the
full outer join also depends on the kind
of data source that you're connected to
all right so in case of an Excel file we
still do not have the right Auto join
option which is enabled so this possible
option again when you open with a legacy
depending on the data type is how you
will have the right Auto join that you
can pause and have it enabled so this
would be depending on the kind of data
source file also that you have and you
have these four joint types that you can
use in terms of joining tables in
Tableau now when would you want to use a
join all right so uh a scenario is that
you have a sales manager of an online
shopping website and you want to analyze
the customers who have returned at least
half the number of orders that they have
placed now to fulfill this requirement
he will require a worksheet whereas he
can join the orders and the return
tables on a particular common Dimension
all right so that's how then we can
create a join we can change this between
uh the inner default to a left join
between the order tables and the return
tables and based on that he can then get
to know the customers who have returned
at least half the number of orders that
were placed all right
now in terms of enabling a right outer
joints uh this is taken care of by the
Microsoft jet data engine driver so in
case if you all are facing of trouble
where you're not able to connect and see
that particular option it's throwing an
error this Legacy connection options
comes in only when you're using a
Microsoft jet data engine driver this is
easily available in case if you do not
have it you can install this driver and
with this it will enable the right outer
joy and the custom SQL for us all right
to enable the uh right out of join here
that's how you open it with a particular
or Legacy connection now in terms of a
write out a joint we saw an example we
can force and use the right outer joint
we can select on a new custom SQL where
we can type in and have our custom uh
SQL generated
and that's how we can work on with the
SQL where we can provide the SQL syntax
and based on that the data source will
then be generated
now in terms of blending this is what
happens when you have multiple data
sources in your viewer when you want to
establish a link between them or you
want to blend your data uh it does not
create a row level joint so in case uh
like the example that we did also which
is coming in from the same sheets or
from the same Excel file but we did not
want to create a row level join then
that's when data blending would come in
handy you can use it with a related data
across multiple sources that you want to
analyze in one particular view so that's
how you can blend your data which
creates a primary and a secondary data
so we saw that in this example uh you
can see that it is a customer segment
department and some of sales wherein the
bars are being created which are coming
in from the from the primary connection
but in terms of the sales plan all right
these sales plan are coming in from a
secondary data you can see the Amber
connection your the Android that is
allowing you to understand and segregate
and differentiate that it is a secondary
connection
so in Tableau that's how you can
identify as you saw that your primary
source and you have your secondary
source wherein you can identify and
distinguish you can distinguish between
the common fields that are present in
your data and uh you can establish a
connection in case if it has not
established a link you saw that there
was an automatic link then you can
provide a link Autumn uh by explicitly
defining a link as well let me take you
back to uh the environment
all right so this was the custom SQL
foreign
provided then you can provide a
particular link onto your view you can
have the option if it has not enabled
then you can select your particular you
can see that uh it has not uh implicitly
defined but it's giving you an option
that there is possibility of linking so
you can explicitly Define you can click
on this link and use person as a linking
field and this is also linked in your
data with the previous data that you
have all right so that's how you can
Define and explicitly mention uh the way
that you can blend your data and you can
identify another way can also be wherein
you can edit uh the connection in the
mapping and that's where you can perform
so you can go back to your data sources
and you can explicitly Define you can
identify uh whether the first rows are
the names whether the rows your are
automatically generating a field or not
all right so that's how you can have
these two tables and you can Define the
blending whether you want it or not you
can disable the linking as well in case
you don't want to perform a particular
link
so uh with uh coming to that now let us
understand I've already discussed the
difference between the joints and blends
and where you can use it so let's uh
have a recap again or in terms of
joining uh joining is a SQL term wherein
is combining two data sources coming in
from a single data source while in terms
of blending it's more about combining
two different data sources into one
single sheet all right uh joining is
done once at the data source and this
can be used for every worksheet while
blending will be done individually for
every worksheet okay and
that are joined must must exist in the
SQL database while in blending it helps
us combine the database which is coming
in from different sources different
locations and in case if it's a
multi-dimensional source if it's a cube
then you cannot perform a joint and in
terms of blending you have a primary
source and uh but in in terms of a
primary source it cannot be a queue but
your second resource can definitely be a
cube that you can use in terms of
performing a blend all right so that's
how you can optimize your connections
you can select whether you want to have
uh perform a blend on your connections
you want to perform a join depending on
the kind of connections that you have
and that's how you can work with them
with the different data sources that you
have available
so not putting in time here we're going
to proceed further in understanding how
we can create data extracts all right so
as I mentioned the extracts are where
you create a subset of your data source
you can extract a particular data you
can save it as a subset which will help
you when performing and improving your
query so instead of the live you can
simply click on the extract which will
create a tableau extract for you all
right
so uh let me just show you let me take
you to the uh repository and in that you
will be able to identify in my Tableau
repository data sources you can see that
we have a tableau extractor for World
indicator so what it's done is it has
created a subset of the word indicator
data source and it's created it's
disconnected it's an offline mode which
can allow us to improve the performance
it can be accessed offline as well when
you're away when you're probably
traveling and we can then create and
extract where we can keep refreshing it
with the original data and we can then
replace it with the content or we can
provide a complete incremental refresh
to these all right now extract can also
be created from uh within our data sets
as well once you've performed so let's
say let me go back to
and let's have
captivity in our columns let's have
quantity on our rules now even here you
have the option of going under the data
menu where you can uh click on the
extract data so whatever you've selected
any kind of performances and any kind of
the aggregations that you perform now
this is your uh data that you perform
now in instead of even though it's a
live connection you can still go to the
data menu here and you can click on
Create and extract the data which will
create a subset all right which will
create a subset for you where you can
create this data and you can provide the
different fields wherein you can select
what you want to filter whether you want
to add a specific filter to your field
whether you want to specify the
aggregation data for the visible
Dimensions this is where you can select
the option for the measures to be
aggregated uh the default instead of
using the default uh what is the kind of
aggregation that you want to use so this
can allow you to minimize the size of
your file as well and increase your
performance you can click on aggregation
and you want to roll up the dates to
your to quarter to month you can select
on the aggregation
the number of rows that you want to
allow in terms of the incremental fetch
or you want to provide
the incremental sets for all rows or
just the top particular selected rows so
you can select on that particular option
once you've specified all these
detailings you can then click on extract
and that's going to uh save the
subsequent uh file in the location that
you have saved in terms of the extract
and it will save up and extract for you
all right so when you click on extract
it will ask you for a substitute
location of where you want to save it
there is a customs query that we have
used and let's say if we save it on the
desktop itself you can see the save type
which is a DOT pde which is a Tableau
Data extract and the next time you can
start working using these data extracts
and you can start performing where you
do not need to then have your custom SQL
written in or any other detailings you
can simply use the extract and start
working on it all right you can actually
uh restrict the size and improve the
performance and you can perform data
extract from these as well all right
foreign
menu option here you have the option to
replace your particular data source so
let's say you have your uh option where
you want to uh perform of or incremental
set then you can replace the data or you
can upgrade it or for that matter you
can go to this particular uh table you
can refresh your data with the uh
connection where you have the uh
additional refresh data you can view
your data you can duplicate it rename it
we uh just discuss how we can create the
extract data options as well so that's
how you can perform and see and and have
an extract
of your data so that was uh using your
data extract
now uh you can also write custom SQL so
you've discussed that let me take you
back to the presentation slide and have
a recap so here this is the window that
we saw in terms of the extract where you
can add in the qualifications where you
can narrow down your data even though
further you can select an incremental
search whether you want it for all the
rows or limit the number of rows to be
included in that particular extract uh
then we also saw that how we could write
a custom SQL we could open it in a
Legacy Collection that uh helped us to
open up a custom SQL window where we can
write down the SQL with the exact data
that we want to analyze this can again
help us in improving the query
performances where we can write down and
provide uh an optimized query against
our data that we want to use
all right uh in terms of the supported
data sources a lot of you all had
questions what kind of data sources are
supported now Tablo desktop is uh
supporting the uh it determines uh the
support depending on the kind of license
that you have purchased all right so
only when you have the required license
it will support the different data
source sites and you have a personal
Edition which provides you and allows
you to uh use the support for a lot of
databases uh but it is the professional
editions that provides you additional
database options that you can connect to
so data such as text files access files
Excel sheet uh and so on these can be
connected through the personal editions
while in terms of a professional Edition
the professional license this is where
you can connect other than the other
than the personal editions you can
connect to the personal uh additional
databases like your Oracle SQL and you
can connect to certain more additional
connections here which is supported 40
plus data connections which is supported
in the professional Edition all right so
that's how you can connect to these
different connections now
also along with that once you have your
server that comes into picture uh What a
server does is it provides you a code
Ros authentication which is a supported
trusted authentication or that it uses
in terms of your single sign-on all
right so what it does is in this case is
that uh as you can see it is a protocol
that is provided to trust the
authentication between your machine
and that's how uh it uses a third-party
network service called as the KDC the
key distribution center which provides a
secure connection between your desktop
and the server machines and this is
supported based on the Kerberos
authentication all right and that's
where you can it handles in it uses only
one user authentication the permissions
and the access control uh in such cases
like the workbooks uh is is going to be
now these the workbooks and extracts
will not be handled by Squadron but uh
the permissions and access control those
are the things those are the detailing
that for Ross will be handling in terms
of your data connection
all right so basically if your taboo
server has a code block enabled uh on
your machine with a valid active
directory credentials then what Tableau
does is it connects to your server and
it completely skips the steps of
authenticating so in case let me take
you to the environment
you're in the environment you can see
the server option and in this you have
the published workbook now let's say
when you want to you've created your
workbook and you want to publish it onto
your server now this is where it asks
you to connect to the server here it
asks you to provide the credentials and
then based on that it then asks you once
you've connected to let's say you
connected to your server it is then
going to ask you a sign on for that
particular configuration now if you have
a foregross environment which is
activated then it's going to skip these
basic steps here and it will directly
allow you to connect and Skip these
connection uh that comes in in between
so that is what is called Ross
Authentication
right so it's a single sign-on method
and once you have that enabled then you
can make use of these you can you need
to configure your Tableau server with
these curb Ross configurations all right
so it's a three-way Authentication
Protocol
now how this works is a mechanism of
mutual authentication between the client
and the server is provided with the
corbos authentication so when the Hugo
user logs into the directory it directly
asks for the credentials which are
authenticated by Ford raw and once this
is authenticated a ticket is generated
and sent to the user's computer and then
when the user tries to connect to the
Tableau server from the desktop or the
web browser the server or the tablets
over authenticates the user and it
directly allows us to perform now this
mechanism is provided before the network
connection is opened up between the
client and the server right
so how does it work in terms of a single
sign-on how does it support it is it
supports a single sign-on option wherein
you have the server configuration and in
this you have a core brush tab that you
can uh Define enabling these single
sign-on options in terms of the
environment where you can connect uh
individually you can connect with a
single sign-on to connect to the server
from your desktop or the web browser all
right in terms of trying to optimizing
your query
now how can you optimize your query
Tableau adopts various query
optimization techniques to improve the
query performance all right so what it
does is it it provides parallel query
where it improves the performance speed
of the dashboard by performing and
providing the capability of executing a
parallel query so in this case what
happens is it executes more queries at
the same time it is independent uh
queries that start at the same time and
hence they are faster and improve the
performance so this is what Tableau does
it provides a parallel query next in it
has the query Fusion in this what it
does is Tableau has the ability to
reduce any kind of complex or large
number of queries into a few or simple
one so that's how it again optimizes
your performance all right and then it
also has external query caching in this
it quickens up the process of optimizing
your data by processing it into a cache
all right so that uh it does not need to
go and hit in the warehouse every time
that you require a particular data so
this is possible with the external
queries caching so Tableau adopts these
various uh methods it also has a data
engine vectorization wherein it has a in
memory analytics column and it's a
faster query which helps in reducing the
extract size and creation time so based
on these that's how it can improve the
performance and that's how it optimizes
these techniques and Tableau handles and
takes care of each of these so it
performs The Parallel query by phone it
uses a particular query faction which is
short it does not uh it shortens up all
the queries the external query caching
that it uses and also provides a data
engine vectorization where it makes it
even more thicker and faster
now in order to Quicken the process of
your loading of data what Tableau does
is it creates and saves a shadow extract
file on its own all right what it does
is uh in the repository for you to load
your data faster other than you creating
an extract it takes up the content of a
shadow extract in your repository file
and it saves it up as a shadow while
you're working on the workbook all right
and that's where then when you're
creating and working uh based on the
Legacy non Legacy excels or text files
or statistical file it creates a shadow
extract file automatically wherever you
have your repository so in case when
you're working on something what it does
is in your repository folder all right
where you have your repository which is
in my documents in the data sources you
can you will be able to see that it
provides you a particular
uh extract that is or Shadow extract
that's been created and you can see that
uh it it creates a shadow extract right
there where you can make use of all
right or in the background so this is
done automatically by Tableau to Quicken
up the process this is something that
you do not need to handle uh by default
this uh the folder there is a folder
that gets created uh when you have a
proper licensed version then you will
see that in the repository folder you
will have a shadow extract folder and uh
based on that that is how uh you will
see that at least the first file at
least the top five Shadow extracts will
be uh save with the dot DT TTD extension
and that's how it uses and replaces it
replaces the oldest one so when you have
a license version in that case then
that's when you will be able to see this
extract folder and uh this is when it
Pickens up the entire process
and also if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply Transportation program and data
analysis from code University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details on this
course click on the link in the
description box below and on the pen
comment let me begin with the next topic
which is calculation all right now in
terms of calculation uh these are pretty
much these help us in terms of
understanding in terms of creating an
extractful meaningful result of our data
all right so sometimes it's pretty much
necessary that we make use of calculated
fees now you've already seen that I've
been making use of we created the ship
to date and I created various
calculations and I've been mentioning
that uh you know I'm going to discuss
these in detail in the next topic when
we have like we created the primary
table the secondary table I showed you
the quick table calculation so you're
already pretty much aware of how I was
using them but let us understand these
in detail now all right so let me begin
so at the end of this session in terms
of when we complete this topic you're
going to understand how you can make use
of spring dates logical as well as
arithmetic calculation how you can work
with different aggregation options how
you can make use of the grand totals and
subtotals the quick table calculations
which are inbuilt by Tableau how you can
create automatic and custom splits
discovering the ad hoc analytics which
is offered by Tableau and how you can
perform the LOD that is level of details
calculation all right so let's begin
with the very first topic how you can
work with strings eight logical and
arithmetic calculations wherein you can
create a completely new field which is
not present as part of your underlying
data you can actually create that using
a specific formula there are functions
and operators provided so you can use a
string right you can use a date you can
use logical operators or arithmetic
calculations and based on that you can
then apply certain functions and
operators and finally create a
calculation so you can create these four
kinds of calculation the arithmetic take
string and logical ones all right so let
us understand and explore how we can use
how Tableau provides us various built-in
functions wherein we can use a
calculated field and create an
arithmetic calculation so we've seen an
example where I created a profit margin
or a profit ratio in our earlier sizes
in our earlier demonstration wherein you
can use let's say when you want to
create the profit ratio we use the sum
of profit divided by sum of sales so
that's how we created an arithmetic
calculation similarly we can create a
new string calculations all right so I'm
going to show you an example of each of
these uh and then we can also we saw
right now I created the days to ship in
the earlier example for one of our views
wherein I use the date calculation where
we created the date and we will also
make use of one of these logical
calculations to see and understand how
we can make use of the
if else or The Logical calculation
operators and functions and make use of
these calculations so uh we have a
scenario here so before that let me move
on to our Tableau environment here right
and um
let me start showing you one of the
examples of each that we can use in
terms of creating them all right
and in here let me quickly create one
simple view so I'm going to add in so
I'm going to add in my stage two roles
and I'm going to add sales to my columns
and quickly create one bar chart here
all right
foreign
States here all right but I also want to
know the sound of distinct items all
right so in this case what I'm going to
do is let me have my product name
right because I want to know the count
of the skin distinct items I'm going to
right click on the product name here and
I'm going to then drag and drop this to
the columns over here or right onto the
column section now because I've selected
the right click option and then Dragged
In dragged and dropped in the product
name or Dimension onto the column it
opens up the drop field as to how I want
to use it whether I want to use since I
want to use a distinct field in
analyzing all right it's opened up this
particular window of whether I want to
use the count product name or account
distance product name all right so I'm
going to select the count distinct
because we want to distinctly analyze
the sounds of the items all right and
click on OK
all right uh what are aggregation
functions aggregation functions because
that's the sum the average these are the
different aggregation functions so right
now the basic default is come all right
so it's summing up the major whatever
measure we've selected that's the
aggregation function so whether you want
to sum it up you want to average it out
you want to use median count minimum
maximum these are all the inbuilt
aggregation functions provided by
tableau or then you can also use the
aggregation functions when you're using
calculated C is beyond the ones provided
so those are aggregation functions
uh yes we have a bar chart I'm going to
still analyze and show these details to
you further in terms of aggregation so
what I did was instead of just using the
product name as it is I've used account
distinct all right uh could you please
drag and drop the product name or you
want me to show that to you once again
Shiva yes I'm gonna take this off my uh
columns here now when I want to add my
product name if I directly drag and drop
it onto the columns it's just going to
add up the details asking me how I want
to use it as a dimension now that's not
what I want to do because as per the
analysis I want to I want the count of
distinct items right so for that I'm
going to Simply right click on product
name and then I'm going to drag and drop
the product name onto the columns so in
that it's going to then ask me what is
the aggregation I want to use on my
dimension and I want to use the count
distance you can see count product name
and count distinct product name so I'm
selecting the second option and clicking
on OK
now I want to see the CH4 item sold and
this particular field is not available
in my data set so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create uh one using my
calculated field because I want to see
these scales per item all right so let
me uh right click on my sales here all
right in the database one way of doing
it is you can right click on the drop
down you have the option of clicking on
create a calculated Keys all right for
that specific piece or in the data pane
in the drop down here it says create
calculated field okay you can select
either option when you select the drop
down for you from here it's blank and
you'll have to input the formula when
you select a particular field and do it
then in that case it opens up and adds
in the field by default wherein then you
can specify the functions and operators
so let me specify the arithmetic
calculation here so uh the first type
that I'm showing you the very first
option in terms of calculator see the
arithmetic calculation all right okay
so let's have our
sum of sales
and
foreign
the only reason I did that was right now
I'm just trying to create account
product name and once I add in the
details I'm then going to replace the
particular uh view from it all right so
I'm going to divide this with the
counts
product name
all right so that's how we are creating
our sales for item calculation using the
arithmetic calculation method sales for
iTunes so I'm dividing the sales based
on the count listings of the product
name all right
and let me click on OK
and with that you know in the measure we
have a new measure that's added up which
is the sales for item this is this
particular calculated field I'm going to
place it is getting placed in the
measures directly because it's returning
a particular number right the numerical
value and hence is placed in measures
now let me add my sales score item into
the columns so I'm going to replace my
account product name here right
foreign
on a distinct basis all right and I
cannot change the aggregation functions
here so notice earlier when I specified
the default function is come we can
change these aggregation functions for a
particular measure from the inbuilt ones
or we can specify it as a calculated
field now in this case it does not give
us any option to change the aggregation
function it shows it's aggregated
already because it's a calculated field
it's taking in the aggregation as we
specified in the in the arithmetic
calculation
all right so that was your example of
having your calculated arithmetic
calculated field
so here we can see the sales for item
for each state
right this kind of an example is an
arithmetic calculation
great so let's move on now we've already
seen these covered up this first type
which was arithmetic calculation now let
me show you an example of how we can use
calculated fields and create a string
calculation all right so let's say we
want to analyze the customers beginning
with the name f or right the one that's
Illustrated in the in the slide here
which says that we will be analyzing the
customers beginning with s okay so in
this case let me add up my customer uh
name into the rules
right
and let's have profits in the columns
all right so we have customer names in
rows and columns all right
now what I'm going to do is let's
consider that at this point of time we
have a range we have a scrolling and we
have a range of customer name here and I
only let's say want to at this point of
time let's say I want to develop and
come up with a scheme that all the
customer names beginning with the word s
all right they are entitled to getting
uh or discount all right we're coming up
with a particular offer now it would be
pretty difficult if I add up the
customer name in the filters here and
then manually select the one with s
right or I can also use the Wild Card
wherein I'm using the option to select
one with an S similarly I can also make
use of the calculated field to achieve
the same uh scenario
so let's click on create calculated
field let's name this as customer with
all right customer beginning with s and
now we're going to provide now if I
expand this Arrow here you can see there
are a lot of functions provided by
Tableau in terms of number string dates
type conversion logical Advocate user
and table calculation and that's where
uh based on that you can make use in
selection and it also specifies the kind
of requirement of any a small definition
an example preview of it all right so in
case it's difficult to remember all the
aggregations it's difficult to
understand how it's created you can
simply click on the uh type and that's
how you can come up with uh the
definitions of these as well right so
let's have the function starts with
because we want all the customer names
starting with
and we wanted for customer name
beginning with
s
now in terms of the calculation it's
telling us there is a particular error
so let's find out that
all right and now my calculation is
valid I have my customers beginning with
s all right I'm creating a calculator
field and click on ok now this is going
to bring in a string function so when I
click on OK it adds up a Boolean logical
to and false uh data type and it adds it
up to the dimensions because it is
related it is based on the string
functions here for the customers all
right so uh this is how we have a
calculated key selected and let me this
time add up the customers with s into
the filter
all right and now it gives me the option
of true and false all right whether I
want to include it whether it's true of
false and let's say I'm going to say
that I want to include that particular
option with the customer name beginning
with
all right and we do not see data here
let's just get what is the problem
this is excluding our data let's just
give me a moment
we have our customers let me quickly
edit
starts with customer name as
and this is absolutely okay
all right so we have the true and false
option and we want it true as the
customer's name beginning with s and
click on OK and we now see a list of
customers name that is beginning only
with the letter N all right uh
Jacqueline uh starts with customer name
so this is how we can make use of each
string as a calculation all right
next now let us see how we can make use
of the date calculation now we've
already performed this kind of a
calculation so I'm going to explain uh
in terms of the date calculation when we
wrote in the days to ship what what each
of it uh mental right when we wanted to
analyze the difference
uh yes it's going to be case sensitive
in that case to say you're absolutely
right so uh in case if it's not a lower
case it's not going to take in the
function Tableau somehow has a case
sensitivity and it only takes in a
lowercase
uh I saw that example to you so when
you're saying that uh you know in in
terms of the letter s it's not going to
be case sensitive for the uh alphabet
because you always think customer names
beginning with the alphabet F in this
case it's not but overall it's case
sensitive I'll just show you that
example in terms of the date
calculations right away
so going back on our Tableau sheet here
we have the days to ship that we've
already created so I'm just going to
click on edit now in this case uh if you
notice the date difference uh what needs
to be specified for a date difference is
there are three parts to this all right
so let's say now we wanted to analyze
the number of days it took from for the
order to get shipped all right so in our
data set we already have the order date
we have the ship date
all right and we want to calculate how
uh the number of days uh is required in
terms of shipping the product so uh I'm
using the date difference function and
in this case then we need to use there
are three input that comes into picture
all right there are three cases here so
the first one is wherein you want to
specify what part what role is it going
to play all right it's going to play the
role of a day because I'm finding out on
the basis of day you can add it as week
month depending on the role that you
want to play and then the difference
between those two values that you want
to subtract the difference that you want
to have between these two so we have the
auto date and ship date now if the same
day you can see the calculation is valid
now let me change this to a
and you can see that it shows an error
in the calculation so in this case it
needs to be a lowercase that's when the
case sensitivity is uh it takes an
effect and it's going to throw in an
error in case if you're going to write
that right in terms of the first
parameter all right uh it's not going to
be case sensitive because you're only
specifying the customer name here so
you're picking up it from the customer
name what is the letter alphabet that
this letter should take up all right
but in terms of the date shift to date
calculation fees you need to it's case
sensitive where it only works with lower
cases because you're specifying what
part is it going to play the day to
shift uh what part when it's playing
Thomas of the difference it's going to
play the part of day
all right so that's how you can create
the days to ship and you can make use of
the date functions and you can create a
date calculations all right that's how
we have the days to ship options and we
can make use of it also it is not
present in our data and we can analyze
our entire data here in terms of
creating the days to ship
so that was your days to ship date
calculation similarly then you have the
logical calculation all right so I'm
going to show you an example of uh how
you can use a condition or a logical
calculation and use them in terms of
your analysis so let me go back to
our environment here let me create a new
sheet
now let's see let me give you a scenario
here that we want to highlight all these
subcategories that has sales of more
than 100 000 all right so for that we're
going to create a calculated feed that
will only specify the sales of sub
categories of 100 000 and above so let's
create the calculated piece let's give
it a name as sales kpi and now this is
where you're going to provide logical
functions and operators and let me enter
the syntax so I'm saying if my sum of
sales
so with the bracket if my sum of sales
is
greater than
100
000
then
hi
as
foreign
yes it is and I'm going to now create a
sales kpi so that I can highlight these
subcategories having sales more than 100
000 as high and low all right let me
click on OK
and now we have the sales kpi that's
added up to the measures but we've used
you can see uh although it's a measure
it's showing the ABC icon here in terms
of the data type because we have it as
high and low measure zero all right so
in terms of the expected let's see the
expected output here and see how we can
make use of it so I'm going to add in
my
subcategory
into the columns and let me add my
sales
into
my sales kpi into the room
right and
or rather I can add up or let me add
sales to my roles all right and this is
where now when I want to highlight uh
that's how I can create the calculated
field and add it up in the colors so
that it can distinguish between high and
low so I'm adding up the sales kpi into
the colors and now we can distinguish
that the kpi is one which is above 100
000 it's high or then low so these are
the ones we can identify between high
and low the alerts that we can make use
of
is it considering the order date minus
ship date or shift date minus order date
uh minus referring to minus uh one
second let me just open up this ship
date uh when you're saying
uh it is ordered it minus the ship date
right
so that is what it's going to refer to
because whatever is the order date minus
the ship date that's how we're going to
get the date difference right the dates
took to ship
excellent all right uh yes I am at sales
kpi let me open that up in terms of
editing if you want to edit that
particular
yes
uh Delete uh you asked me to open up the
Cs kpi there you are
can we use a multiple conditions uh in
terms of multiple condition if you're
saying that uh High average and moderate
is that what you're saying
like let's say you want to say that if
uh sales is thousand then it should be
high uh as if fails is uh eight eighty
thousand then it should be moderate or
low then you can use the Airship
operator that's how you can add up the
Airship operator and make use of the the
detailing that else if sales is uh
greater than or less than 80 000 then
create it as
so you can use that multiple option or
only thing is you need to use the
Airship option then in this case
yeah you can use multiple conditions
like uh let's say let me quickly show
that example to you
so if you create a calculator field here
uh you can use a case in which you can
mention the East West or low all right
so you can use different kinds of
examples and cases and scenarios where
you can mention uh the different sales
and budget that if my sales is so much
then it should be uh you know that
particular date or else you can use
multiple functions that's not going to
be a problem
okay
so this is going to be an example of
your
logical operator
we have our next topic which is working
with aggregation options all right now
this again you've noticed a couple of
times that by these faults we have our
calculation wherein Tableau takes in the
default calculation all right being the
sum but uh you can change these
aggregation functions you can see an
entire list that Tableau provides to us
right and that's how you can make use of
these aggregated functions that is your
uh whether you want to have a summation
whether you want to have an average all
right so there are different
mathematical functions your that you can
see and these each will produce a
particular aggregated data all right so
these are what are called your
aggregation functions all right and
these will help you perform the kind of
aggregation the kind of calculation that
you want to perform on that particular
field so you can make use of these
functions all right and
so now understand one thing you can use
uh Tableau to set up your aggregations
only for measures in your relational
data sources all right in terms of a
multi-dimensional data source it
contains the aggregated data already all
right so it provides you these list of
predefined aggregation floor as you can
see so let's understand each of these
functions now when it comes to an
attribute all right in this case this is
going to be returning the value of your
expression which has a single value for
that row all right so let's say let me
move to the environment here to
understand and explain what these
particular functions are all right I'm
going to pick up uh and discuss a few of
them now let's say we have sales all
right sales by default when we talk
about
the aggregation function so you need to
right click and go to default properties
and you have the aggregation option
where you can see some it's set to
default you can change these default
properties to the aggregation that you
wish to which are present here all right
you can have an average you can have a
median account a count distinct and then
various other options present here right
so when it comes to using an attribute
all right or the absolute aggregation
function as specified then in that case
it's going to return the value all right
of the expression as one particular
value of the row okay so uh in this case
it shows the field then changes to a
text I can attribute where it ignores
any kind of null value if it's present
okay so you can basically make use of
these when you want to only pull in
let's say values of all the rows uh
which is otherwise displayed as a
different uh different values in it okay
so so that's when you can make use of it
now that is not present here in this
case as you can see as an app to do that
comes in handy when you're using
calculated Fields all right so let's say
when you open up a calculated field you
will see you have the attribute which is
termed at attr the attribute expression
let's say we're saying the attribute of
sales so you can notice it gives you the
entire definition it Returns the value
of the expression or if it only has a
single value for all the rows in that
group and in case if not then in that
case it will display it as an asterisk
sign so that's what it does it it's
useful basically this aggregation is
useful when you want to aggregate a
particular Dimension all right let's say
we have customer name we want to
Aggregate and come on to the number the
names are the total number of customers
that you have so in that case it will
only return single values of that row if
not then it will otherwise just stay as
an asterisk so that's when this kind of
a function comes in handy for us uh not
that you cannot use it with the measures
but just an example of the best use when
you want to aggregate a particular
Dimension and you want null values to be
ignored you want to know the single
values of all the rows then this
particular uh aggregation a function is
going to be helpful all right then in
terms of your next one you have then you
have Dimensions now these again will
return all the unique values all right
in your measures or Dimensions both so
it's going to only bring in all the
unique values here in this case and in
terms of sum we are already aware in
terms of average then you have median
now this is again to do with it's going
to return the median of the numbers in
the measure then you have count and
count distinct all right so count is
going to ideally return the number of
rows in your measure or Dimension and uh
it it that means null values are again
going to be ignored but in terms of
sound distinct it's going to return the
number of unique values so count will
return all the values the number of
values which are present but in terms of
count distinct it will return the unique
values in a measure or dimension all
right so that's how you have various
aggregation functions and to know
details of each of these you can make
use of the uh tablet provide the details
about each of these because your various
as you can see your various inbuilt
functions there's an entire list of
functions that you can make use of and
uh anyway you need to know additional
details now these are the basic ones
that you can see the inbuilt ones
so if you want additional aggregation
functions as well you can make use of
these functions from the calculated
fields and each of these has its
explanation provided but in terms of the
basic usage one the ones that you can
change it to default yours a basic list
that Tableau provides so it has uh
additional functions as well but that's
when you'll have to then open up the
calculated field and make use of those
functions
so that was your aggregation function
all right
then comes in your grants totals and
subtotal sleep again you're already
aware we've seen this in our earlier
examples that we are able to make use of
our totaling option we're able to add in
the grand totals as well as subtotals of
the data wherein we can see the grid
that is displaying the subtotals and the
grand total geographers right you can
see the brand total right here and you
can see the subtotals for each category
level as well and the grand totals
across every uh sub category for this
particular category towards its
particular Year all right now to enable
your grand total you can simply go to
the analysis menu so you've seen that in
our earlier examples as well and that's
where you can go to the analysis totals
and you can make use of and have your
totals enabled so that's how you can
have your totals
now coming on to a quick stable
calculation let me now discuss on this
because uh the other topics were Recaps
that we've been performing now you've
also seen that there were instances when
I performed with table calculations all
right so these are basically calculated
Fields when we apply a particular
cancellation at a data set level all
right so Tableau provides certain
functionalities it provides certain uh
functionalities here in terms of
applying the calculation at your table
level so as the name suggests table
calculation it allows us to provide that
kind of functionality whereas it
computes the uh applied uh values all
right in your entire table and this is
basically dependent on the structure the
table structure that you have in your
view okay so that's how you can make use
of stable calculations and what Tableau
does is it provides some input functions
which are usually uh in use it provides
it as an inbuilt quick function where
you do not have to input put any kind of
formulas in those functions you can
simply click on those options and refer
to immediately compute the entire range
specified that you're selecting all
right so let's see one of the examples
so I'm going to take you to the
environment here
and let's have our order date in columns
let's have our sales and rules
and let me just enable the labels as
well all right so that's created a line
view since it's a series over time uh so
if you remember in the chart type the
best uh example is to make use the best
references to make use of the line graph
and hence Tableau automatically creates
a line chart here for us right now we
have the yearly sales as we can see all
right now
let me add sales again to the roles so
what I'm going to do is we can see two
uh sales calculations here so what I'm
going to do is with the second
calculation I'm going to in the drop
down you have a quick table calculation
consisting of all your detailed
translations here as you can see so you
have these running totals so this is
going to show you a cumulative total all
right then you have the difference so
this is in terms of showing you the
entire difference about uh some absolute
change between the measures that you
have all right then you have the percent
difference so this will give you
difference in terms of a percent value
all right it shows you the uh difference
in terms of those options as a percent
then you have percent of total so this
is going to give you the values as a
percent to the entire total so what is
the contribution of each year in this
case to the entire total uh that you
have in terms of the contribution all
right the sales then you have Brands so
this is going to rank our values
numerically we have percentile which is
going to compute our values in a
percentile or manner we have moving
average
this is going to calculate the
fluctuations in terms of identifying uh
any long-term Trend all right then your
today tables or then you have compound
growth rates year over year all right so
there are various such functions that
you can see here which are provided by
Tableau all right now I'm going to
change and uh use the percent of total
all right so this is going to give us
the values of the percent for every year
that it is contributing towards the
entire total what each year is
contributing so let's click on percent
to total
and now we can see here the second sales
Bill there is a calculation I can draw
in terms of the triangle icon that you
can see which says that is performed or
table calculation on the second sales
Bill all right
uh so in that case we can now see the
percent to sales for all the years what
is the contribution all right so that
was a quick stable calculation where it
allows us to apply based on our
requirements the defined functions we
can simply click and view those
calculations instantly in our view all
right and now in a lot of cases we might
want to customize these calculations so
that's when then you can have your
additional table calculations that you
can manually perform all right
in terms of moving now uh when we're
talking of moving average or any kind of
moving function all right here it says
moving average but this is one of the
calculations which can be a moving
average or any other calculation where
is moving cancellations will ideally
show us a of fluctuation or fluctuation
that we can identify in terms of long
Trends all right so that is what moving
calculations are so we will see an
example of this of what are moving
calculations and that's how you'll be
able to understand the difference of
what these are right and again like I
said to understand these in details we
can also make use of the
aggregation functions we calculated
field where it can give us the entire
detailing right so this was a quick
example let me add this as a quick table
calculation
now next as I mentioned these are in bit
ones that we made use of but there are
times where we might want to customize
these tables all right so in this case
let's have our order date back in
columns let's have our sales in rows
right we've again created a view let's
have
uh now in this case I'm not going to add
in another pin I'm going to perform the
calculation on the sales Bill itself
that we have here right so you're on the
sales page now instead of quick table
I'm going to select on ADD table
calculation because we want to provide a
customized one so if you've seen an
example earlier when we wanted to build
in a Pareto chart or other kind of
charts where we may use the stable
calculation right it calculated our data
in terms of calculations across at the
table level so let us understand how
these calculations come into picture how
they compute the values of the table
level all right so these are the drop
downs again provided in terms of the
functions the computations that we want
to make use of and apply to the rows in
our database to calculate our values all
right so let's say I'm going to select
running total this time all right
and instead of the uh how do I want to
summarize so I want the running total
and your again whether I want it as a
sum as an average a minimum or a maximum
let's say I'm going to pick up average
so what we're doing is we're going to be
seeing our sales as an average running
total Year all right and in terms of
running along whether you want it across
the table a particular cell all right or
a particular field in this case so we
can uh specify now since we have ordered
it and our view is giving us the option
to select from the available view so
let's have it running uh across and
let's have it across the order date all
right so that's how we can select each
of these different uh requirements and
compute the value that we want to
perform
right so that's how we can have these
computings that are taking place right
so
when you talk of table across then in
this case it computes the entire table
it will compute the entire table across
here that we can see in terms of uh the
the tables here which are present in our
view all right when we talk about uh
calculating in terms of the cells all
right then in that case it's going to
pick up uh the individual cells present
in our room all right so in this we are
addressing to the individual cells which
are present now uh had I changed this to
a table view then that's when we would
specifically talk about let's say we
were at a year level and we had
aggregated this as a quarter level or
let me just change that option and show
you all so that you'll get a better idea
let's have this at a quarter level all
right and let's say let me add in region
as well
now in this case we would be talking
about individuals when we talk of table
calculations happening at cell levels
we're talking of an individual level all
right so we are talking of four 2011 for
the central region for quarter one all
right so I wanted to address individual
cells and perform the calculations right
so that is what would be the cell level
our then I can select an individual
field so that's when we were selecting
the order date and in that case we could
select a particular field and mention
that it needs to compute at that
particular field that I'm specifying all
right so I'm just going to undo and go
back to our previous View where we were
performing our table calculation and we
selected the running total
we had our summation summarizing at
average and we selected a particular
field all right and let's click on OK
let me enable the data label so your now
we can see a calculation where it's
performing or running average of sales
year for us now all right now in the
same case let's say we want to also have
a secondary now that was our basic
calculation now let's say I want to
perform another calculation I want to
apply it to this particular table so
then we can also apply a secondary
calculation in that case wherein we can
combine two calculations and we can
perform one on one of these calculations
so let me on the drop down you have the
option of edit table calculation of
clearance so let's click on edit and
this is where you can see the checkbox
that says perform a secondary
calculation on the result so what taboo
will do is it is first calculate this
particular uh primary calculation that
you have all right the basic calculation
basic table calculation that you're
providing once you compute this
particular calculation it will then
perform a secondary calculation a second
calculation on this particular result
all right so that's how it's going to
then compute and combine two
calculations in this case so in the
second example let's say let me specify
um
let's have the difference from let's
keep it to a basic so the first we want
it as the running total once it's given
us the average running total I then
wanted to perform a secondary
calculation on the running average of
sales where I want to know the
difference from in terms of what is the
calculation that I want it to provide
all right so let's again keep it at the
level of
um let's select order date again all
right so again I wanted to perform at a
particular field and what is the level
that I want to specify so you're in this
case since you're mentioning the order
date do I want it at the deepest level
or right the granular level or do I want
to specify it at a particular yearly
quarterly monthly or daily level or the
entire aggregate of the order date so
let's say I'm going to specify at a
yearly level that I wanted to select all
right and let's click on OK so it's now
performed a secondary calculation based
on the previous one and that's how we
can make use this is useful when we want
to perform our calculations to our data
in the tables and instead of a single
calculation there might be times there
are instances where we might want to
combine two calculation so that's how
you can make use of the basic and the
calculations in terms of having a
secondary one as well so let's say uh
you want to calculate the year-to-date
growth or right and once you have the
year-to-date growth then based on that
you might want to then compute that once
I have the calculation I should get the
percent difference for each total in the
previous year so then that's how you can
apply and make use of your secondary
calculations all right now you can also
customize these calculations all right
so we have the option as I mentioned you
can go to the edit selection and that's
where you can edit your tables and have
the editing provided
and we have a scenario here now
company and they want to increase their
market share
all right and uh in this case they want
to uh ensure that they're having higher
profit margins all right so what uh what
Jennifer needs to do is she needs to
ensure her company's sustainability and
then she needs to identify the
opportunity for business and how she can
make the most of it right
right for this she needs to determine
these sales brands for
based on a quarterly breakdown so let us
achieve this particular scenario now to
achieve days as Jennifer what is
Jennifer going to require to do all
right so let's first quickly on our
notepad add in our requirements so for
us to achieve this particular scenario
for Jennifer yo what we're going to be
doing is firstly we will create now
since we are going to talk about uh year
over year we're talking about time based
analysis we will create a line chart
right so we will have a line chart in
terms of our sales based on orders
at our your D level
next time to further proceed with the
scenario now we need it as a quarterly
breakdown so we are going to drill and
we're going to drill out of quarterly
levels
foreign
calculation because we want to know
these sales variance for your over yours
growth all right so hence we will create
a table calculation
and this is going to be in case of
difference because we want to know the
the difference the variance for your
over your growth for our sales
all right so let's achieve this
particular scenario going to the
environment and let's begin with our
analysis here all right
let me have my order date as mentioned
at a yearly level let's have our sales
all right and that is or we that creates
our line chart we're done next we need
to drill at a quarterly level all right
so let's drill our data and have a
quarter Day level
right and finally then let us now have
now we need to perform we can see the
sales and now we need to know the
variance the difference all right we
want to know uh we want to create a
table calculation with difference so I'm
going to add in another instead of sales
here to our rows on which we perform our
calculations all right and and now I'm
going to make use of the quick table
calculation because we want to know the
variance the difference for year over
year right so in this case uh I've
tracked my second pill and let's have it
at our
so the difference level here all right
so we can see the difference now that is
one way but if you notice it's still a
little difficult in case of judging the
entire view here all right so what I'm
going to do is uh to make of you better
let's have our sales fill all right from
the gross shelf let's add it up to the
color shell so what it's going to do is
on the existing sales view is going to
identify and distinguish between the
colors for the difference that we have
and that's how we'll be able to identify
the difference so let me just drag and
drop it and we can now see our view
where we can identify our sales and the
difference which is based on its color
the red the darker the size the
difference of sales is our analysis here
says that it's in minus all right and in
terms of a Greener so differences on a
higher side with green right so that's
how when you hover as well at a
quarterly level you can see that for
2007 we have a particular phase and its
difference that we can see all right
in terms of the previous table
so that's how you can make use of your
calculations and Achieve our scenario so
let's name this as sales analysis right
right so that's how we're able to
achieve and have these sales variants of
year over year that we can notice the
growth and based on that we saw the
quarterly breakdown as well where she
can now identify the growth
opportunities for business right so
that's how we can make use of table
calculations
I'm going to move ahead with
understanding what are box plots all
right so in terms of docs plots now
these are used when we want to compare a
set of data all right and uh when we
want to ideally analyze a distribution
of data which is highlighted up to five
key values all right within our data so
that's a box plot what it usually is
also known as a box and whisker plot all
right and it helps us in seeing the
distribution of the values along the
axis all right so the boxes here that
you can see please indicate the middle
fifty percent of our data all right and
uh
then we can also configure you can see
these this curves or lines as you can
see these these called these lines and
uh these display all the points within a
1.5 percent of the range so let me show
that to you all each of these in uh the
slides here so there are five key values
that is represented in the box plot the
first it shows us the minimum value all
right second it shows us the 25 quartile
all right then it shows us the median
the 75 quartile
at the maximum value all right so that's
how it highlights up to five key values
within the data all right so we have the
Shaded box all right in the example that
uh
denote these five values let me go back
on the previous slide here so the boxes
here is what is representing over here
you can see these are representing the
50 of our data all right so these shaded
boxes the the light and dark gray here
these are called quartiles all right so
namely we have the upper quartile and
lower quartile so the lower quartile
this starts at 25 of the data set and
the upper quartile it starts at 75
percent of our data set all right so
these two boxes these contain the middle
fifty percent of our data all right and
the lines here these are called your
whiskers this can be configured to
stretch to your uh maximum extent of
data or within a 1.5 times of the
interquartile range that is all the
points within a 1.5 percent is what you
can make use of all right so this is
where uh we understood so we have the
minimum values right we have these 25
percent
25 of the data set the median the 75
quartile of our data set
and then the maximum value so let's see
how we can create a box plot and
switching to the Tableau environment
here adding in a new sheet
and
so let me have my
segments added in to the columns
and we have my profits added up to
the rules
and let me have my
order date
into the details section
right
let me ensure that
this is a discrete date value
now let me if I click on the access here
and say let me add a reference line
and this is where when I right click on
my Axis I have the options now we will
be discussing all these uh lines in
terms of the topic statistics when we
try and understand reference lines bands
and distribution but to create a box
plot we can click right click on the
axis and uh go on to the reference line
and choose the box plot option now this
is where you can specify the viscode
extending to your within the data within
the 1.5 percent or the maximum extent of
the data right the minimum and at
maximum that we were talking about the
style of how you want it to look like
The Spill colored let's pick up a red
color all right the borders and how you
want your whiskers the thickness the
lines that you want it to be and click
on OK
so with that it's created a physical box
plot here for us it's providing us with
the viscose and the lines
in terms of the segments here all right
uh let's say you can also do this in
terms of having your particular analysis
uh creating these box plots by adding
some more additional data and detailing
as well all right let me show you uh one
more example of a box plot all right
this is a very simple one so it's pretty
much where we're only trying to analyze
based on the uh segments you are in the
profits where it's created a box plot
and giving us each of these segments and
the profits for its particular year now
let me show you one more example of a
box plot to understand the five values
that it picks up all right so let's have
our segment added up to the columns and
let's have let's use discounts this time
so what we're going to do is I'm going
to create a box plot view that's going
to show us the discounts based on our
segments and regions all right so let's
add in the discount onto the rules all
right
uh let me have my
region as well so
let's have region and let me have this
added up to the column right here next
to the segment so it's created a nested
level again based on every segment for
its own region what is the discount here
all right so we have two levels of
hierarchies of our Dimension right from
our left to right within every region
that you can see you're listed
now let me go to the show me option and
let's change this now another way of
changing that was we can also go to the
show me option and click on the box and
whisker plot view here all right so one
way was I right click and I selected the
reference lines and I selected the box
plot option or another way of doing it
is click on the show me option and click
on the viscore and box plot or charts
that you have here
right so your now this has given us the
entire view displaying a box plot where
we can see uh all the marks here in each
box that has been plotted up so it's
assigned the regions here uh as you can
see in terms we can see the regions and
uh in the columns from The Mark shelf
right remember that there would be
regions which is placed in the columns
as soon as we selected on box plot it
automatically assigned a region on the
columns itself here in the marks card it
reassigned it let me just undo this
option so this is how we had a nested
bar graph created when I go to the show
me option and click on box plot notice
that region from The Columns will get
added up to the mark section here okay
there you go you can see that it's got
added up here so basically when we
change it from a bar or from any chart
type to a box plot then Tableau is
determining uh the individual marks in
the plot that it should represent so
it's determining that the Mark here that
we have should be represented based on
region all right so well you can change
that as well so let's have our region
dragged back onto our column all right
so we want it at a regional level here
and uh based on uh for every segments in
every region now we can see a horizontal
line that is created a flattened box
plot here in this case all right which
is uh the reason being that it's right
now giving us a value based on a single
Mark all right now box plot as the
description as the definition says it is
intended to show us the distribution of
our data right now What's Happening Here
is it is aggregating the entire data and
the current View and you can see a
flattened view of flattened
so we want to disaggregate our measures
in that matter we want we want to uh we
want to have our aggregation uh level
changed and disaggregate our data where
it can give us an entire distribution of
our data so you're in the analysis menu
click on the analysis menu you can see
aggregated measures that have been
enabled I'm going to uncheck this option
and by this I'm going to turn off the
aggregation all right so I'm going to
disaggregate the measures here so that
we can now see that the data which has
is at a disaggregated level wherein we
can Now understand each of these uh
marks instead of a single Mark we are
able to view each of the marks for every
column in a range of the data source
that we have all right now to uh see and
View and understand some additional
information here to make this more
readable make this more appealing what
I'm going to do is I'm going to swap our
axis here and I'm going to make this
into a horizontal view all right so that
it's going to be easier see it's going
to be easier for us to compare every
segment the region for every segment uh
what are
the discount that have been offered all
right now let me let's add some
additional analysis to this as well so
at the bottom axis we have the discount
here I'm going to Simply go on to the
edit axis that we have we have the
option to edit the reference lines you
can see the reference lines and
automatically there's a box plot that
has been selected so we can edit these
reference lines and change the entire
banding and the colors as you remember
so let's select something more
interesting from a library let's select
a red one or you can also select on the
transparency level so let's add up the
transparency level to let's say 80 all
right uh let's stick to the borders as
it is and the viscose as
the default and click on OK right now
with that we can see that the discount
is pretty much the same all right the
discount is pretty much the same with uh
for all the segments so if you notice in
terms of whenever we're seeing all the
best all right the desktop right
so that is one analysis that we can see
also we can see that the interquartile
range that is the 25 to the 75 percent
of the discount we have the central
region and that is showing us the
highest range all right so uh this is
how we're able to identify and uh see
the highest ranges here so each of it is
representing the entire detailing that
you can see here so the box is here all
right these boxes are representing the
50 of our data then again these are
divided as the 2.25 quartile and 75
quartile and then we have the Brisco
values which are configured based on the
maximum and minimum the reference lines
that we have the maximum uh are the
maximum and the minimum values in terms
of the interquartile range all right so
that is your box plot so the box here
the one in the center these are
indicating the 50 of the data and again
you can see two quartiles two
distributions of the data all right and
then the whiskers which is showing us
the quartiles in terms of the minimum
maximum of 1.5
so let me take you back to the
presentation slide so we have the
maximum value
we have
the 75 quartile that we saw
the median the 25 and the minimum value
so that was an example of box plots
also if you're an aspiring data analyst
looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learn Sports graduate program and
data analysis from code University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details on this
course click on the link in the
description box below and on the pen
comment now with Tableau you can almost
create thousands of visualizations
possible although we have like 26 basic
in the show me option that we can see
Tableau allows you to explore and build
in in this kind of views possible in
terms of analyzing your data all right
so let us try and see and see a few
examples and understand how we can make
use of our data in terms of creating and
visualizing our data and creating charts
now working with combined access this is
when you want to use multiple access and
in an example yesterday we saw that we
could make use of measures where we can
share a single access and displayed on a
single pane all right so we could
combine access using two or more
measures than a single one where we
could create a blended or a dual axis
all right same way we can also make use
of a combination chart now this
particular type of chart
right it it helps in using our multiple
views as you can see in the same sheet
all right so when you're working with
multiple measures again we can actually
customize the mark type that we can see
here all right in terms of making each
of the measures distinct so we can see
that our sales is represented with bars
while our average profit is represented
as the line Mark in a view so even here
in the mark start notice that our sum of
sales is represented with a bar while
the average profit with that of a line
all right so that's how you can make use
of combination charts now how to create
a combination chart it is pretty simple
let me take you to the Tableau
environment and show you how we can
create one
the obr we have our Tableau instance
opened up right here I'm using the
sample Superstore order sheet the basic
that we're going to use for the purpose
of our training all right let me add up
let's say let's analyze our uh sub
category let us replicate what we saw in
the example Illustrated in the slides so
I'm going to add up subcategory to my
columns let me add sales to my rows and
let me add profits as well to the rule
all right and let us use the average all
right now if you notice uh creating this
kind of view has given us two different
axis now when we want to uh have these
access when we want to make it into a
combination then in that case we will
need to add it up either as a dual or
blend it up all right so in that case
let's just have our profits added in
creating a dual chart now let us change
the view now if you notice you're in the
mark section is where I'm going to make
the changes all right so we have the all
option wherein any kind of visualization
or type that you select either change it
for both that is all the marks all the
measures that are present or then you
can individually click on the names you
can see we have sales click on sales in
the drop down let's change it to a bar
let's click on profit now this time
average profit and let's change it to a
line right so that is how we can make
use of a combination chart we can select
the mark starts to specifically modify
each of the mark type for the view that
we are seeing all right so that's how we
can have a distinct box for each of the
measures that we're using in order to I
modify the colors you can simply go on
to the measure name plot and you can
edit the colors and you can choose the
colors that you wish to select and
format it right so that was a
combination chart
moving back to our presentation slides
so with that let's come on to our very
next topic which is working with
geocoding and Geographic mapping now we
have been discussing all throughout uh
that Tableau automatically assigns the
geographic roles we saw yesterday again
that it created the latitude and
longitude and generated it in bills all
right uh based on the common
geographical names so when you have your
Dimensions like countries State Province
City and so on Tableau automatically
assigns it as a geographic role so when
we double click on a particular
Dimension let's say country or state it
automatically adds up the latitude and
longitude in the columns and roads all
right you can see here it is
automatically adding up we saw that
example yesterday as well and that's how
we can create and make use of geocoding
in Geographic mapping so it
automatically opens up the map for us
wherein then we could further analyze uh
we've seen this example now in terms of
discussing Maps more in detail I would
do that when we proceed and discuss on
the mapping topic but we have been time
in and again understood that
geographically is the Tableau
automatically defines them and
automatically generates the latitude and
longitude based on your data and when
you double click on it it automatically
creates the mark corresponding to a view
and creates that kind of a map view for
us right next till then we have the
scatter plot all right now your scatter
plot one of these visualizations these
kind of visualizations help us when we
want to visualize a relationship between
numeric Fields so you can see you have
profit and sales and you want to
visualize the relationship between the
profit and sales now this is an example
of a simple scatter plot or right while
you can see that you can also create a
matrix of Scatter Plots wherein you can
create a nested view a nested look by
adding in additional Dimensions as well
to your Loop right so the entire view
that you have so that's how you can
create a scatter plot where you want to
analyze the relationship between a
numeric value now let me take you to the
environment back again on Tableau and
let us explore in terms of Scatter Plots
what Tableau provides us so let us
rename the sheet as combination
charge all right going on to the second
sheet
now in terms of Tableau when you want to
create a scatter plot you need to place
at least one measure in the column and
one in the row so even if you go to the
show me section all right you have the
option that says scatter plot that
requires at least two or more measures
as a minimum requirement all right so
hence let us have our sales placed up in
columns let's have our profit cased up
in the role and with that it has now
automatically you can see that even in
the show me suggestion it's indicating
that a scatter plot would be one of the
best examples because we're trying to
identify the relationship between the
numeric values all right
now in this case we've added in the sum
and the sales and profits all right but
we need to aggregate before the look as
well because as we can see here the
measure is containing numerical data and
it has only plotted up one value again
uh when we're comparing two values that
is sales and profits right so we can
it's resulting in a Cartesian chart as
such where we are only saying the x and
y axis and hence we can only see one
mark all right now let's add some
additional analysis to this so I'm going
to have my category added to the colors
and this time it's now distinguishing my
sales and profit access in terms of the
categories by differentiating with the
colors of furniture office supplies and
Technology all right what is the profit
and what is the sales so that means it's
separating it into three marks here one
for each Dimension member all right
now let's see let me add the region to
the details sections let's see what's
going to happen now
now you can see we have additional Mark
additional marks into a view so what
happened in this case is the number of
Marks here is distinguishing on these
regions as well now so we have
categories so we have these three
color-coded categories and each of these
categories is now being distinguished
with region so you have South you have
Central you have east and you have West
all four regions and that's how you can
now distinguish four different uh marks
for these three different categories
that we have available when we added it
up in the details section
so that's how we can create this was a
simple scatter plot that we can create
now in this case we can also create a
matrix one wherein you can add in
Dimensions you can have a nested or
column and row wherein it's going to
give us some additional analysis let's
have category added up to the rules and
let's have region added up to the column
so now you can see let's take off
regions this time from our details
and you can see now we have each of the
region it's plotting in the category at
different levels right so that's how we
can have the analysis performed where
you can make use of the dimensions as
well and you can have the uh measures
aggregated giving us the entire
detailing based on each of these regions
right so that's how you can create a
simple scatter plot as well as a matrix
one as well so now we also have a
scenario and let us try replicating the
scenario back in our environment all
right now uh let's first understand the
scenario with today's Dynamic economy
and demands to be more competitive and
profitable concrete product launch
processes are critical that's pretty
much obvious all right so keeping the
same in mind Jason Rogers he's the
general manager of a phone manufacturing
company and he needs to launch a new
mobile a new model of the mobile phone
in the upcoming year now for this he has
to analyze the sales and profit of the
phone across all the states to come up
with a winning product launch process
now for this how is Jason Rogers going
to achieve this particular analysis let
us switch to the environment
and let me show you how we can achieve
the same for Jason Rogers so what we're
going to do is first thing all right let
me just quickly open up a notepad and
let you know how we're going to be
achieving it so first we are going to
create a vertical bar
right wherein we're going to have these
sales by state right next is what we're
going to do is we will create a blended
access
all right in this case wherein we're
going to then show The Profit
and the profit values
uh the sales and the profit values
and finally to achieve now since we need
to only find out based on phones we're
going to add in a filter and we'll
filter down our data which is going to
narrow down our results only for phones
okay and
once we've done the basic analysis we
convert our view into a scatter plot
where we can see the Statewide sales the
first one that we have and we're also
going to see the profits and values for
the subcategory which is full all right
so let us achieve Integrity scenarios
now we're already connected to the
sample Superstore data set here
let us create the vertical bar as
mentioned so let's have our state added
up to the columns
let's have our sales added up to the
rows and it's created a vertical bar
viewer for us right wherein it's giving
us these sales or the sales by state now
we need to create a blended access
that's our second detailing that's
required right so we're done with the
first one we've achieved the first
scenario now we need to blend the access
where we're going to blend the profits
and sales all right so let's have our
profit measure and in terms of blending
in creating a blended access I'm going
to Simply have my sales drag and profit
dragged and dropped in onto the sales
access here all right so now we have a
blended access giving us the entire
detailing where we can see the sales and
profits here all right now let me add
the measure name to this color so that
we can distinguish between the profit
and sales so I'm going to add my measure
names which is automatically generated
by Tableau into the color field
and now we can identify we can
distinguish between the sales and profit
wherein sales is represented as orange
and profit and three all right now let
me add in a
filter because we need to have our
filter on subcategory for phone so let's
add it up to the filter section here
right
and we are specifically going to select
on phone
let's make use of the search section
and let me select on phones and click on
OK
all right
so that's our view we have these states
we have the measure name we have the
phone that we have identified all right
and uh now let's say we do not want this
kind of a viewer bar in bar view so in
that case you will need to add in the
menu names onto the columns as well so
that it can replicate the measure names
as two separate views of it all right
you can simply click on double click or
you can use the control key and have
your measure name Dragged In onto the
columns that's going to uh basically
create a double View
[Music]
didn't work earlier when you want to
replicate when you want to duplicate one
of the pills all right then in that case
in a normal scenario if you drag and
drop the pill it's going to Pivot so
when you want to replicate when you want
to duplicate a bill use the control key
on your keypad and then drag and drop
the pill wherever required so that
creates a duplicate bill for you all
right so now we've distinguished we've
aggregated it as profits and sales we do
not want it stacked up all right
now next thing we have already achieved
let's say what are the details have you
achieved all the details we created a
vertical bar we've done that we created
a blended access that's done we created
a filter on phone all right and now next
we're going to create our last scenario
where we'll create a scatter plot to
achieve the analysis that is required
all right so first can be already know
the profits and sales so that's our very
first scenario of sales
and profit
for our phone
right now to achieve the next scenario
let me add in let me take up a new sheet
and let us create a scatter plot right
so let me this time use the control key
and select the required details that we
want to analyze so we want States we
want sales and we want profit let's go
to the show me option and this time we
can see that the scatter plot option has
been enabled for us let's click on the
scatter plot it's built in a scatter
plot for us now let me add
the stage to the color section so that
we can distinguish each of these uh
categories the sales and profit based on
these states all right the color will
help us distinguish for every state here
so I've dragged in the states to the
color shells now again we're going to
require a filter specifically for phones
so let's add subcategory to filters
let's filter it with
phone
and click on OK so now we have data
specifically only for our phones
criteria all right now next in
uh you can see uh let's let's create now
we can see the scatter plot here we can
create the views and we have
automatically added in the entire
details all right
now let me also add in the states to
the shape here so what's going to happen
is if shape is going to identify
uh the marks as well the type so each of
the shapes and each of the colors so
every color is identifying these states
and every shape as well is identifying
the state as well separately for us in
this view all right
we have skate twice the first one is
denoting us with the color the second
one in terms of the shape the third one
that you can see here this is denoting
just the details here all right the
details for each of these shapes in
terms of the tips the tool tips that
you're doing so this way we now have a
comparative sheet wherein you can see
the profit and sales for which
particular region is it showing the
highest profit range and see as you can
see we have New York and we have
California all right so we can that
please identify uh the scatter plot
wherein we can achieve this scenario as
Jason Rogers wherein we can come up with
the launch plan uh depending on which
particular region is having and is
having the highest sales and highest
profit and based on that we can decide
on the states that he should launch and
create a product launch process for
these particular skills all right so
let's name this as
scatter plot
now formatting as we already know as we
are aware is a very important part of
both our analysis as well as our
presentation all right everything that
you see that you view in your sheet you
want to ensure that there is a proper
formatting applied that are shading
fonts lines and borders all of this
makes a lot of difference when it comes
to how you want to present and view your
data all right so it is pretty important
and hence in this particular chapter
we're going to be discussing on
different formatting options that are
available how we can format our
visualizations how we can make use of
the colors the uh worksheet themes in
terms of resizing in terms of working
with labels the map sites all right and
we're also going to discuss on
annotations on how we can make use of
annotations and annotate a particular
value right
so let us explore what I'm gonna do is
in this particular topic as I have
already mentioned we will describe and
understand what is spatial analysis
someone had also raised a concern on day
one as to what spatial analysis was so
I'm going to discuss that topic right
away and that's going to resolve and
fall out on your question then we are
also going to understand how we can make
use of titles capsules and Tool tips and
how we can format access as well as how
we can format our views and results as
well as use Mark labels and annotations
all right so let me directly move on uh
before I proceed here uh let me now move
to the Tableau environment here and
click on the new sheet now talking about
spatial analysis facial analysis is what
is related to your Geographic data all
right so Tableau works now how it works
with fields in a special manner Tableau
also also with the geographic fields in
a special
automatically assigns Geographic roles
so any data that you have in your data
source so if you notice I had discussed
this yesterday write in your data source
it can identify if there is any kind of
data related to geography it
automatically assigns it with a
geographic role all right so that is the
specialty of Tableau in case it is not
able to identify in terms of the uh
analysis whether it is a geographic role
or not then you also still have the
option wherein you can click on the data
source and describe the kind of
geographic role that you want to assign
all right you can customize the role as
well whether this particular country and
option is or area code is a city is a
county is a state Province all right so
you have the option so you can keep it
to default and the data type as well so
you can customize on the spatial data
and something very interesting about
Tableau for that matter with the related
to spatial data interesting data is let
me take you on to the sheet and
regarding mappings all right we're going
to have a detailed discussion on
maps and how we can create Maps but let
me since we're talking about facial
analysis and since I mentioned it
automatically identifies Geographic data
let me show you how it treats the
geographic data so URL you can see we
have the country all right and we can
see it is already identified it as a
geographic data provided a globe science
when I double click on country
all right what Tableau does it it
automatically as you saw adds in the
longitude and the latitude for the
country it automatically generates the
latitude and longitude all right and
that's how you can see the map now these
are different layers and WMS maps that
you can make use of so uh we are going
to discuss this pretty much in detail
when we come on to the maps chapter
but as you saw the moment I double
clicked on Country it automatically
added in the land longitude and the
latitude into the columns and rows so
that's how Tableau treats uh spatial
data that's how it works with Geographic
data
all right so coming on to discussing
with the formatting I'm going to take a
new sheet here now formatting as I
mentioned there are various ways various
types of formatting that you can perform
all right so uh let's let's talk on the
most uh common ones in terms of how you
can open the formatting pane in the very
first place uh the formatting option
that you have all right so for that let
me quickly create one view for you all
let's have category and let's have sales
right and now you can see that you have
the format menu pairing when you click
on the format menu it gives you all the
options whether you want to format the
fonts you want to format the alignments
the shadings the borders the lines you
want to format a reference line if it's
in your view drop line annotations
titles and captions scale labels so
these are all the options in terms of
how you want to format so this is the
entire uh window these are the entire
options that I'm going to be discussing
about so in terms of how to enable the
format say in the very first place is
that the moment you click on uh format
here all right and you select a
particular option let's say I'm gonna
say I want to format the fonts in the
view all right because of that notice
what happened did you also your tension
the data pane here got replaced with the
format sale so that's how it opens up
the formatting and then you can see all
these same options in the drop down here
that you could see in terms of fonts
alignments shading borders and lines you
can format your fonts your alignments
shading your borders and lines so in
your view you can select whether you
want to format the font whether you want
to format the lines you want to provide
a shading you want to provide a border
or you want to provide any line
formatting and again in that there are
three tabs for every option that you
will choose right so this means Tableau
allows you
to either format your particular font or
shading or bordering or coloring for the
entire sheet or you can also do it for a
particular row or a column
all right so it gives you that option or
you can select a particular field as
well whether you want the format a
particular field
now in terms of the font here you can
see you can choose whether on the
worksheet what is the font you want the
pane the header the totals how you want
your totals to resemble the grand totals
now these are visible and worked when
you have text tables highlight tables
all right grid kind of a view
similarly you can format your rows so
that Grays out the worksheet option and
allows you options in terms of
formatting your roles and the same
option for columns
for your fonts all right so let's say
I'm going to have my
worksheet wherein I'm going to have my
header
increase to the size of 16.
and let's have
a greenish shade added to it we need a
little more darker color to it there we
go so we formatted the headers and the
values in our view all right
so that's how you can format the font
then comes in the alignments in terms of
how you want again based on sheet rows
and columns all right whether you want
to align the pane as horizontal all
right whether you want to align it as
left right or Central align all right in
terms of the direction of your text so
in case let's say you have a lot of data
you can change the direction of your
text
or whether you want it vertical or
whether you want to wrap up your text
all right so those are to do with the
alignments that you have and that's how
you can align the row the column or the
entire sheet so in terms of horizontal
you can control whether the text aligns
to the left right or the center
all right in terms of the vertical
option you will control whether your
text aligns on top all right in the
middle or at the bottom
so top middle or bottom in terms of the
text alignment then coming on to
Direction how you want the direction of
your text whether you wanted to run
automatic or so it is taken based on the
kind of data is there in your view or
you want to keep it to normal up or down
all right that is top to bottom or
bottom to down
and then based on the wrap whether you
want to use when you have long headers
then whether you want to have a text
trap that needs to be taken place or
take care of so whether it's off or on
you can select on the options and
and each of these uh effects and options
will take place on your sheet depending
on the kind of view and visualization
all right so that was to do with your uh
alignments coming on to formatting the
shading this is to do with you can
format using the shading command you can
control the background color of your
Pane and header all right so again you
can decide whether you want to apply it
on the entire sheet the rows or the
columns so you can let's say in the
sheet select that in terms of the
background I need it to be a little
lightish in terms of a lightish pink so
it's put in the shading so that's how
based on the worksheet the total row
banding all right so you can actually
have a Band-Aid in terms of when you
have a text kind of a table you can then
perform a row banding so let's say let's
choose a text table you can see that you
can take off the shading keep it to none
and then you can provide the kind of
banding size that you want this is the
size of two you can change it using the
slider so not banding based on every
three values let's add sub categories so
that it makes your view a little more
easier to understand
so let us just use the
hierarchy drill down
go back to formatting
and now this is happening after every
third value in terms of the band size
the levels as well we can decide on the
levels and in terms of the column
banding as well how do we want it all
right so we can change the levels of the
banding
okay
then you have the in terms of formatting
in terms of border so you can format
these borders in your view wherein you
can decide on formatting these cells the
paint the header the totals you want to
divide the particular row or divide the
particular column all right you can make
use of these as well in terms of
Divisions wanting to have a clear a
better View
all right
if you can see we've divided it you want
a thicker line
all right in terms of column dividers as
well
how do you want it the view that you
want to select
all right so that's how you can format
your borders as well and finally comes
in the option in terms of
your lines how do you want your line
format setting all right you can control
the lines that occur in a graph now in
that case you will have to change the
view to uh different kind of graph and
then that's where you can decide using
every toolbar whether you want to see
grid lines all right
you want to see the dotted lines is
there a particular color that we want to
add in
right
or thickness needed not needed
trend lines now when you enable so when
we come out to trend line topics is
where we'll discuss but once you've
added a trend line to your view as well
you can format how you want your trend
line the color that you want to choose
if you've added in a reference line a
drop right you can make these options
available in terms of formatting in
terms of the access rule as well audio
wanted to be you want it as none
or you want to provide a particular
dotted line to it all right
so that's how the view will keep
changing depending on the kind of view
that you have all right so that's how
you can format the lines as well in your
view you can also format a particular
part all right now instead of just
formatting or we saw we could format the
entire sheet or the row of column in
terms of fonts in terms of alignments in
terms of shadings in terms of borders
and lines we can also format a
particular field as I mentioned you can
format the fields in terms of how you
want your field to look like in terms of
let's say you can click here and you
have the option of format which will
directly open up the field as what you
want to do in terms of the header or the
fail all right we have the size let's
reduce it this time to 14. and let us
change the color of it let's have a
bluish color so we are seeing the
headers now are changing in terms of the
header for our category
all right so that's how we can choose
the formatting option here whether we
want to do it for the plane write the
font whether you want to change that and
change the color
so that's how you can perform it on a
particular field as well
all right now in terms of formatting
numbers we had a question whether can we
format and specify a particular option
in terms of numbers as well uh yes you
can if you can directly have uh this
option where you can right click again
and click on format which will give you
the option in how you want the fonts
again for this particular field which is
sales it's giving you that you're
formatting it for sales the scale the
number format where you want to use it
as automatic or standard number or
custom number or currency so there was a
question put up where uh we were asked
uh can we format the currency so you
have your answer or your questions been
answered right here in terms of
formatting all right so uh there we go
we can also format in terms of the
numbering options as to how we want to
format it based on uh the options here
for number format I will let you know
each of these options so automatic is uh
Tableau will automatically format the
number based on the uh format specified
in the data source or the data are
contained in that particular field all
right in terms of number standard it
will take in the format which is based
on your local that is selected the kind
of Locale that you have selected are the
geographic location that you have it is
formatted based on that standard setting
in terms of custom your you can
customize it as per your liking so let's
say instead of writing let me use a
notepad here to show you all so let's
say instead of writing 20 000 we want to
show it as 20K uh you can use the custom
formatting and that's how important 20
000 you can use and write it as 20K so
you can use the custom option in that uh
for that manner in terms of numbers
coming on to currency again it will take
in the currency symbol based on the
local that you have selected the
geographic location and in terms of
custom then you can provide a custom
unit you can provide a custom uh
currency option in case uh and how do
you want these separators whether you
want to have uh commerce between every
thousands or every hundreds so that's
how you can again select it at a
customized level
scientific is the numbers will be
displayed in a scientific notion that is
the decimals uh where do you want to
place your decimal values all right
percentage as the name provider is going
to show you the numbers in a percentage
format and customize where you want to
provide and type in a format completely
using a specified custom all right so
that's where you can completely format
and you can specify based on the number
coding or The Styling that you want
so what is data so your filter helps you
in narrowing down your data it can be
applied to a dimension that is your
contextual value to measures which is
your numerical value or to a date field
as well where you want to narrow it down
to a specific value or a range of values
all right in Tableau so what are the
ways that you can uh possibly filter now
what are the different conditions that
you can possibly filter is one you can
select the data to filter in the view so
right you can add it up to the filter
share directly and choose whether you
want to include or exclude the option
the other ways you can have it added up
to the filter shelf as well or you can
turn on the quick filters which opens up
a new card where you can quickly add in
or alter your data in terms of filtering
so let me uh take you to the window
therein and let's start exploring these
options of how we can use scissors and
how we can manipulate our data in terms
of narrowing it down all right so let us
start uh beginning with the very first
one
and I'm moving on to the interface here
all right
now first I'm going to show you how we
can filter on the dimensions okay so let
me take in a new sheet all right and
let's say I'm going to have the customer
name filter so I'm going to use my
customer name Dimension and add it up to
the filter this opens up the filter
window all right and in this particular
window uh you have four tabs as you can
see one thing the general one being wild
card one being condition and top now let
me first explain each of these tabs and
then we'll proceed further in
understanding how we can filter on the
dimension here all right
so in the general option you can select
the list that you want in terms of
filtering and whether you want to
include it or you want to exclude that
particular selection all right so in
clicking on exclude will explode
whatever selections you've made
unchecking this option by default means
whatever we selected I need to only
include those customer names onto my
view all right the next is you can have
a custom value list or you can also have
a use all feature when I'm saying I want
to use all the options and I want to
include these so that is the first
general option the second option is in
terms of
having a y card so a wire card is where
you can specify a particular match value
whether you want to that value contains
that particular alphabet or stocks with
that alphabet ends with an alphabet or
exactly matches that alphabet so let's
say let's use the wildcard option and
say I want the names starting with all
right the alphabet let me choose the
alphabet s
all right so I'm saying that all my
customer names should start with the
alphabet s so when I click on this and
then I use the customer name onto my
view I will only be viewing customers
with the name starting with it all right
so uh conditions is where you can apply
your condition based on a particular
field or by a formula and top is where
we can apply the field to be the top 10
customers based on a particular uh
Dimension or a measure or by a
particular formula so we'll understand
these tabs with different options of
filtering let's use the wild card
all right now in terms of the Y Cloud
option so we've mentioned it starts with
or the letter S and I click on OK
all right now I'm going to add in the
customer name onto the rows so you can
see that we only will have the names
beginning with s it's filtered down
because we said that we need the name
starting with s and we have all the
customers or name starting with an s
here let's add sales to our columns and
we have all the names of the customers
beginning with s that's how you can
filter on a particular Dimension all
right
thank you
all right uh sticker or in terms of the
RC car has put up a question in terms of
uh can we explain the custom value list
in terms of the capital values we got
what happens is let me just open up the
filter here so that I can explain that
to you quickly when you talk of Select
list you can select from the particular
option that you want all right and in
terms of a custom value now let's say
you want to randomly have uh different
names one beginning with a now this is a
huge long list all right so in terms of
a custom value I can simply enter the
names or keep adding in the names that I
already know so let's say if I take it
and Al is there an allen in our name or
let's say we already know there's a
Sally in our name
avoiding the pain of scrolling through
this huge list I know my values I'm
going to Simply add in enter the text
and keypad again so that's the custom
value list
I'm going to cancel the option because I
want to right now uh uh stick on to
customer's name beginning with s all
right so that was an example where we
get built off on a field all right
where I can filter on a dimension field
in terms of case sensitive yes we have
[Music]
we have to usually very case sensitive
when it comes to name so let's say we
already know that uh we have a Sally in
our list let us check if I have Sally
added in as so then in that case you can
see it's giving me a drop down option to
select from in terms of the case
sensitivity and then all the possible
names that are available for Sally it's
giving me the options to choose from
so that was uh filtering on a dimension
now let me show you how you can filter
on the
measure all right so before that let me
show you one more option and using the
conditions tab okay so from the Wi-Fi
let me take a new sheet this time and uh
let's have a condition specified or in
terms of the filter so this time again
let's have our customer names added into
the filter
in the condition now this is where you
can specify whether you want it by fees
or how do you want to select it whether
you want to use a particular card
whether you want to specify a particular
condition now before I move in here to
the conditions there is one important
thing that I need to perform that's your
your there is no y card that's been used
all right but let's say if it was the
same filter on the previous one then you
will need to go back to the Y card
option and clear and uncheck the option
because it will not then be able to take
in all these tabs and detailing so here
I'm creating a new sheet hence no
worries but if we do it in the previous
sheet it says where we have the wild
card then it's going to consider that it
needs to be beginning with this as well
as these conditions but only if you want
the conditions to be applied then you
need to clear the Wild Card all right
so the white card drawer and let's say I
want to know the field and in terms of I
want to know the customer name wherein
my sales all right is uh let's keep the
aggregation now these are the
aggregations that you can choose from
let's keep it default at some and my
sales should be greater than
10 000 all right
let's click on okay now you can also
provide a minimum and a maximum range
value or you can then apply a particular
formula so you can apply your condition
click on OK and now when we add in the
customer name now you can drag and drop
it in the fields as well specified here
and now we get to see only those
customers which are having the sales as
we specified which is about 10 000 let's
add sales and we'll be able to see let's
enable our data labels all the sale
values are about 10 000 for these
customers all right
so you can add in a condition similarly
we can also change these and apply so
now I'm going to this time go to the
conditions Tab and I'm going to click on
the none option because we're now going
to have the top customers by sale where
we now want to filter our data based on
our top customers all right so let's
keep it to default you have the option
of you want to see the top customers or
the bottom customers how many by numbers
10 or a particular parameter those
parameters is where we will be
discussing when we proceed ahead and
discuss the parameters topic
foreign
so yes you will be able to filter on the
dimensions and measures as well so you
can have the top 10 uh customer names
based on my sales yours all right or
let's say you can have it on the on the
basis of profit also you can change it
to profit this time you're using a lot
of sales and let me click on OK all
right so now what happened is notice in
our view we are able to see the customer
names the sales by each of these
customers that have been generated for
the top 10 customers giving us the top
10 profits so although profit is not in
my view these are my top 10 customers
based on profit all right and what is
the sale generated by each of these top
10 customers and who these top 10
customers are all right so that's
another way that we could use is the top
tab option in the filter when we are
filtering on a particular Dimension all
right now there's another way that you
can fit off you can click on a
particular option and keep only or
excluded so that is one bit way of
filtering right onto your data the other
one as we saw was filtering adding it up
to the filter shell all right draw it in
the drop down it also shows quick filter
so when you click on the quick filter
option here it gives you a special mask
part that opens up where you can quickly
keep analyzing instead of going and
editing the option it gives you the
general option where you can keep
analyzing a particular customer name
that you want to see and these are
limited by the top 10 all right
so that's your quick filter option you
can remove it you can apply it to the
sheet you can even customize you can uh
display how you want it to be viewed in
terms of the filter option that is
displayed whether you want it as a
multiple list or slider or drop down a
multiple value drop down a custom list
or a by card match all right and based
on that then you can also mention
whether you want to include these values
or exclude these values and finally you
can hide the cards as well all right
so that was your uh quick filter now you
can also as I mentioned crypto on
Dimensions so let me add in a new
feature and show you how you can filter
on your measures now so uh this time
let's have our customer names on two
rows all right let's have sales onto uh
the filter shares this time so we're
going to be filtering now this time if
you notice the filter shells because
it's a measure it opens up as to how you
want to filter what is the aggregation
that you want to use whether you want to
use all the values whether you want to
use the particular aggregation or some
additional uh analysis in terms of
deviation of variance all right I'm
going to stick to the sum the basic one
and click on next this opens up the
option now whether you want to filter
based on the range of values all right
whether you want to filter based on the
uh least values all right so these are
the different options let me explain
each of these options as well to yours
so in the range of values you can
specify
range as minimum and maximum that you
want to explore so you can use the uh
slider your as well and specify let's
say we want a value of approximately
5000 and narrow down this particular
data all right from 5000 now you can see
at times when you just want to use an
approximate value then it's fair enough
to use these sliders or another way of
doing it in a simpler manner would be
you can simply type in the details all
right so you want it at ten thousand and
five thousand so you can also use the
slider or use the particular Titan box
where you can type in the range of
values next you have at least now this
includes all the values which are
greater than or equal to the specified
minimum value so it needs to be greater
than or equal to 5000 is what we are
specifying so any value that we add in
our state value should be above 5000
that is at least and at most is
obviously then the opposite that we are
mentioning it should include all the
values that are less than or equal to
this maximum value that we've testified
so they're saying it should not be above
5000 they are only wanting this to see
the sales of 5000 and below so that's
the minimum and maximum value of at
least and at most and in terms of
special this is to do with handling your
filter your null values in in your view
so this is a filter that helps you
narrow down on the null values whether
you want to include the null values
whether you want to have the non-null
values or you want all the values valid
up in your view all right so based on
that you can have your selections and
finally click on OK all right so uh let
me click on
the Range you're in this case and you
can select on a range as I mentioned you
can click uh and have the option of
let's say 5000 on to 15
000 and click on OK so now you're going
to be able to see your sales which is
going to be in the range of 5000 until
16 000 only all right
similarly you can also filter on dates
now when it comes to date as well so
filter window opens up in a different
fashion so we saw in Dimensions it opens
up in terms of four tabs in terms of the
measure it opens up the aggregation we
want to use and then this values that we
want to specify now when it comes to
filtering on dates then in this case
what happens is that Tableau opens up a
different kind of window when you're
wanting to filter on dates so let's uh
have a look at that as well
so let me open up the filter dates
option for you all
so let's have the order date added in
onto my filter here so this opens up
this filter window wherein it is
specified uh the date your date field
and tablet was created in a special Nano
or special dimensional it uh often
handles it in a different way as you saw
even when it comes to hierarchies it
automatically creates a hierarchy for
you in terms of dates so even with
filters it handles it in a different
manner here it specifies one whether you
want to use these relative date filter
or the range of dates now when you use
the first option which is the relevant
uh relative dates Builders then here
you're going to be defining a range of
dates that is going to get updated based
on the date and time that you open the
view all right so it's more like
whatever view you select let's say you
want to see the year today sales uh for
the records of the last 40 days all
right so in that case you can actually
specify selecting on the relative dates
and uh that's where you can mention the
detailing up I want to see today's date
and the last 30 days of whatever is
today's date so that's why we're using
the relative dates the next option that
you have in terms of the range of dates
is where you can provide the range of a
particular date where you've been given
uh the kind of date that you want to
choose all right so in terms of range of
dates you will be specifying a
particular range and once you've decided
and selected between these two options
then you need to select on whether which
kind of a filter that on the drilling
that you have whether you want to do it
on a year on the quarter or on the month
all right so that's how you can specify
that particular date and uh let us uh
let me click on the relative days option
here and click on next so when we open
the relative dates then in this case you
can see again it's giving us special
four tabs here so the relative date in
this case is we can specify uh let's say
the sales in the last couple of days so
we can specify whether we want to see
the sales yesterday and last how many
number of days today with the next how
many days or you want to see the days
the sales for tomorrow similarly then
you have range of date so you can
specify a particular range all right
whether let's say you have the data
you're coming in from first of April or
2014 going up to 31st December you can
make use of the calendar and choose your
specific date range you can also use the
slider you have to specify the starting
date again it's more like the minimum
and maximum so starting if all the days
starting from this date and above and
ending is that we want to have and see
our data wherein the ending date should
be 31st of December and sales achieved
until this specific date nothing beyond
that particular in case even if it's
present any data present about 2014 31st
December we're still limiting it that it
should be until 31st of December and
then the special tab which again gives
us the flexibility in terms of filtering
whether there are null dates non-nail
dates or you want all the dates to be
included all right the option we have in
terms of filtering all are dates all
right so as you saw we can filter right
in the view where I mentioned you can
have the exclude or include option you
can drag a particular field right into
the filter shell you can also turn on
the quick filter and make use of it so
that is the filter shelf we saw
depending on the type we can filter on a
dimension or we can filter on or measure
or a date as well
for complex analytical projects
organizing and simplifying data is one
of the crucial tasks it is important to
be able to simplify data for proper
analysis
organizing and simplifying data is a
critical part of Tableau mission to
facilitate you to see and understand
data
Tableau can help you with all stages of
an analytics project by using these
Advanced capabilities
in this lesson we will discuss Advanced
capabilities to complete sophisticated
analytics projects after completing this
lesson you will be able to
perform filtering and sorting on data
create combined fields to merge data
from different dimensions
create groups and Define aliases
create and work with sets and combined
sets drill to other levels of data in
your hierarchies
add Grant totals and subtotals in a view
change aggregation functions for a
measure split a measure value into bins
the first topic that you will study in
this lesson is filtering data
Jenny the sales manager of a chain of
departmental stores is planning to
launch a new branding policy for a line
of furniture that sells well
for this she needs to analyze the
subcategories under furniture with sales
over thirty thousand dollars in the year
2013. to discuss the matter she calls
one of the sales executive Alex
hi Alex we are in the process of
launching a new branding policy for a
line of furniture with good sale but to
decide on the categories I need to
analyze which furniture sales crossed
over thirty thousand dollars in 2013.
can you recommend a way to complete this
task
sure Jenny I think what you need is a
bar chart where you can filter the
results as per your analysis
that's right how can we do this in the
most efficient manner
we can use Tableau application that
provides a number of features to create
bar charts and filter large amounts of
data as per your desired analysis
great you can start working on this task
and present the analysis to me when
you're done
so before we proceed further let's
discuss what is a filter
yes you guessed it filters let you
filter data a filter is a condition
which can be applied to Dimensions
measures or date fields to narrow down
the data displayed in a view
in Tableau they can be either static or
interactive being able to filter data is
essential to any analysis with Tableau
Data can be filtered in different ways
you can apply filter using one of these
methods
select data to filter in the view drag
fields to the filter shelf activate
quick filters
when you select data to filter in the
view the filtered fields are added to
the filters shelf and The Unwanted
fields are removed
when you drag fields to the filter's
shelf a filter dialog box opens when you
activate quick filters the filter dialog
box opens as a new card where data can
be quickly added and altered so how can
the dimensions be filtered
Dimensions can be filtered either on the
filter shelf or in the quick filter when
you drag the dimension to the filter
shelf a filter window will appear
these are the key tabs of the filter
window so how do these tabs function let
me explain each tab one by one the first
tab is the general tab which helps you
select the list of elements you want to
include in the filter
you can use one of the following options
to define the element list
select from list this option allows you
to select the elements you want to
include from the list
next is the custom value list in this
option you can use the search box to
directly locate the elements and the
last one is the use all option that
allows you to include all the elements
in the filter
now you understand how General tab
functions yes I do great let's move to
the next tab the wild card in the
wildcard tab you can match the names of
elements by selecting one of the
following options contains starts with
ends with exactly matches
next you have the condition tab with the
help of this tab you can specify a
filter condition in this only the
elements that satisfy the condition will
be included in the view
to define a condition you can use the
none by field and by formula options
these tabs allow you to perform a lot of
functions what about the last tab in the
top tab you can specify a condition to
include the top n or bottom n elements
to define a condition you can use the
none by field by formula options thanks
Alex Tableau really has some amazing
capabilities let me now explain how you
can apply filter on measures before you
begin with that Alex I have a quick
question does Tableau allow me to filter
on a measure where an I can select to
either filter row level data or an
aggregated value of data indeed it does
Tableau allows you to filter at row
level data in which measure value is
calculated individually for every Row in
the data set no aggregation functions
are used for row level calculations
while in summary level calculation
measure value is calculated using an
aggregation function on the row level
data aggregation functions are used for
summary level calculations
in Tableau the data is automatically
aggregated by performing summation when
a measure is placed on a shelf when you
apply a filter on a measure it allows
you to filter row level data select all
values to filter summary level data
select one of the available aggregation
functions date filters are extremely
common date fields are a special kind of
Dimension that Tableau often handles
differently than standard categorical
data so far we have learned how to
perform filtering and sorting on data
Grant is planning to launch a new
branding policy for a line of furniture
that sells well this demonstration will
help you understand how Greg analyzes
the subcategories by creating bar charts
and applying appropriate filter to it
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a horizontal bar chart with
subcategory Dimension and sales measure
drag the category Dimension to the
filter Shelf
filter only for the furniture category
drag the order date Dimension to the
filter Shelf
select filter field as years to filter
only for 2013.
drag the sales measure to the filter's
Shelf
filter for subcategories with sum of
sales greater than thirty thousand
dollars
observe the change in bar chart after
applying filters
rename the sheet as filtering data
save the workbook as furniture
subcategories with sales more than
thirty thousand dollars in 2013.
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
filtering data
the quick filter can get started for
existing filters as well as for
non-filtered fields
the filter dialog box includes these
filter modes single values list single
value drop down single values slider
multiple values list multiple values
drop down multiple values slider
wildcard match the data can be selected
from the given list as well as can be
searched using the search icon present
in the title area of the quick filter
with a quick filter option you can
quickly add and modify filters you just
need to follow three simple steps
firstly activate a quick filter on the
region Dimension notice a smaller
representation of the filter dialog box
opens as a new card quickly select what
to include in The View
and you are done now let us move to the
second topic sorting of data
sorting data is an integral part of data
analysis sorted data is easier to
analyze sorting a data view refers to a
range in dimension members in a
specified order you might want to put a
list of names in alphabetical order
compile a list from highest to lowest or
order rows by colors or icons
sorting data helps you quickly visualize
and understand your data better
organized and find the data that you
want and ultimately enables you to make
more effective decisions in Tableau you
can sort data in numerous ways sorting
can be performed on axis specific fields
and manually
Tableau supports computed sorting and
manual sorting
computed sorting uses programmatic rules
to sort the view such as sorting
alphabetically or from lowest to highest
manual sorting enables you to reorganize
the order of dimension in the table and
can only be implemented on distinct
Fields with a distinct measure now that
you know that the data can be sorted in
different ways let's discuss each of
these in detail sure I would like to
know more about it to sort on axis you
can single click the sort icon on the
measure axis to sort the bars in
descending order or double-click the
sort icon on the measure axis to sort
the bars in ascending order
the data can be automatically sorted
using the sort button on the axis to
give a better view of data to sort on a
specific field use the sort menu option
to sort by one or more fields in a
specified order then select the data
source order option to sort data in the
order of the data source
the sort dialog box includes these
criteria sort order displays the output
in ascending or descending order
sort by sort either by data source order
alphabetic or by fields to perform a
manual sort use the sort menu option to
sort manually
then rearrange the order of Dimension
members in a custom order based on your
business specifications
manual sort can be done in two ways use
sort toolbar button on the selected item
locate and drag headers in the view let
us now move to the next topic creating
combined fields
combined fields are used to create a
cross product of members from different
dimensions
two or more Dimensions can be combined
to create a Cartesian product of
Dimension members
The View includes all combinations of
each member of the dimensions let's look
at an example a combined field has been
created using segment and region when
added to the view it displays all
combinations of segment and region
elements creating groups and defining
aliases are some more features that
Tableau offers let's understand each of
these Concepts let's say you want to
view data at levels that are not already
present in the data source in such
situations groups are used to combine
Dimension members to create a higher
level member
when a group is created a default name
is automatically formed using the
combined member's name the new grouped
field takes over the dimension on rows
or columns
for example a group can be created by
combining the sales for envelopes labels
and paper for analysis now the question
arises that can alternate names be
provided in this case and the answer is
yes you can aliases will provide the
flexibility for renaming Dimension
members to help make more sense in the
current View
the good part is Tableau does not change
the original data on changing an alias
in your view you can change aliases at
any time using the edit aliases dialog
box
there are some things you need to keep
in mind such as aliases can only be
defined for discrete dimensions and
dates these can be applied to Dimensions
only and not to measures moreover the
method for creating aliases depends on
the type of data source you use
following is an illustration of defining
an alias for the East element of the
reason dimension
let us now move to the next topic
working with sets and combined sets
usually you have large sets of data that
you want to visualize in such a
condition you might find that limiting
the amount of information displayed to
an important subset of Records helps you
work with and answer questions about the
data more effectively
sets are custom fields that Define a
subset of Dimension members a set can be
created for specific Dimension members
in the view or it can be based on a
condition
computed sets are dynamic as the number
of members in the set can vary at
runtime based on the condition
furthermore you can also drag a set to
the filter shelf to quickly filter the
view to display only the members of the
sets likewise you can also create a set
by combining existing sets all you need
is to specify The Logical operator
between the two sets new sets can be
formed by combining the sets consisting
of either all the members from the sets
only shared members members existing in
one of the sets the dimensions of the
sets should be the same in order to
combine two sets by now you have a brief
idea on how to create groups Define
eliases and create sets and combine sets
Greg is planning to launch an
advertising scheme for certain product
subcategories that are related to each
other this demonstration shows how Greg
creates a visualization that displays
the aggregated profit ratio and
highlights the bottom five subcategories
by sales
this demo will give you an overview on
how to create a group to combine
Dimension members
create a computed set to include
Dimension members automatically
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a horizontal bar chart with
subcategory Dimension and profit ratio
measure
select tables and chairs to create a
group
create a set on subcategory
name the set as bottom five
subcategories by sales
click the top tab
under by field select bottom five
subcategories by sales from the drop
down
drag the bottom five subcategories by
sales set to the color shelf to the
marks card
rename the sheet as groups and sets
save the workbook as working with groups
and sets
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
working with groups and sets
now let us study how can we drill to
other levels in a hierarchy
Jenny is required to present the
company's sales performance across
different regions states and cities in
an upcoming meeting she calls Alex to
help her make this report in a quick and
efficient manner
hi Alex I need you to create a report
for me to present the company's sales
performance across different regions
states and cities
sure Jenny are there any specific points
that you want me to keep in mind yes I
want to use the same data source for the
detail and summary information in other
words I want to create a report where
all the data is contained within the
same report
can you suggest a way to do that
sure Jenny for creating such reports
Tableau offers the feature of hierarchy
where you can drill down to several
lower layers of detail
great please start working on this
report and share the final output with
me
I was just wondering can we drill to
other levels in a hierarchy yes we can a
hierarchy is a grouping of related
Dimensions depicting direct parent-child
relationships between them built-in
hierarchies are not present in
relational databases but it can be
inherited from the relational databases
that have similar dimensions
it is useful in the following ways it
facilitates analyzing a high level
overview of your data and then drilling
down to lower levels of detail
what's amazing in that Tableau separates
the data fields automatically into
hierarchies so you can easily Break Down
The View by year quarter month Etc
moreover it also enables you to create
your own custom hierarchies if you want
to view your data at a lower or higher
level in the hierarchy then drilling is
what you're looking for for instance you
can drill up from date through year or
you can drill down from year to date
that way drilling is one of the most
suitable ways to navigate hierarchies
various methods of drilling are
available in Tableau it allows you to
drill using fields on shelves or drill
using headers let me show you how
drilling using headers can be referred
to as uneven drill as only desired
members are displayed rather than all
the members from the list you can click
a header value in the view and select
drill down or drill up from the menu
let's say it is drilled down from year
level to quarter level you can expand or
collapse a dimension in the rows or
columns shelf to drill down or up
respectively the plus and minus signs on
the fields that are placed on the
shelves shows the drill status so that
means the plus sign indicates that it
can be drilled down further while the
minus sign indicates that you can drill
up but cannot drill down further Greg is
required to present the company's sales
performance across different regions
states and cities he is required to
create a report such that all the data
is contained within the same report
let's see how he does that
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a hierarchy by dragging State
onto region
name the hierarchy as geography
in the geography hierarchy drag City
below state
create a report with region and sales
right click West select keep only
drill down from region to state
right-click California Select keep only
drill down from state to City
rename the sheet as sales analysis
save the workbook as company sales
performance
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
drill down report
now let us discuss another important
feature of Tableau Grand totals and
subtotals totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute Grant totals and subtotals for
the data in a view these totals can be
applied only on grid type visualizations
Tableau does not compute subtotals and
Grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and Grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute Grand totals and subtotals for
the data in a view these totals can be
applied only on grid type visualizations
Tableau does not compute subtotals and
Grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and Grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity Tableau computes subtotals
and Grand totals as the original measure
at a higher level of aggregation let us
proceed with understanding how to define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices Tableau allows you to Define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices such as summation and variance
you can change the aggregation function
by right-clicking a dimension in either
the rows or columns shelf or by
right-clicking a field in the data pane
here we have changed the aggregation
function to average next we are going to
study about Tableau bins which are
useful to create a range of data bins
are custom bandings of the values of a
measure based on a specific size you can
bin data only for relational data
sources it does not support this feature
for multi-dimensional data sources
bins can be referred to as buckets of
values and can be created for numeric
Dimensions there are two types that you
can create fixed sized and variable
sized you can create a fixed sized bin
by specifying the size of each bin in
the create bins window
keep in mind that by default Tableau
creates even-sized bins based on a size
you specify
as you can see I have created fixed
sized bins on the discount measure of
size 10 each to create a variable size
bin create a calculated field with an
appropriate script you will learn about
calculated fields in detail in lesson 8
calculations
for now just remember that you need to
create a calculated field to create bins
of variable size
look we have three bins on the discount
measure of variable sizes now that
you've gone through the need and
importance of organizing and simplifying
data let us have a quick look at the key
takeaways filters enable you to narrow
down the data displayed in a view
sorting refers to the arrangement of
Dimension members in a specified order
combined fields are used to create a
cross product of members from different
dimensions
a group is a combination of Dimension
members that make up a higher level
category
aliases are alternate names for specific
values within a dimension
sets are custom fields that Define a
subset of data based on some conditions
drilling helps you analyze the data in a
view at a lower or higher level in the
hierarchy
bins are custom bandings of measure
values they can be created either as
fixed sized or variable sized
time for some Hands-On practice
Now understand the below scenario and
work on it together
you are an owner of a store and want to
analyze the existing discount strategy
offered by your store
you wish to view the number of customers
who have been offered discounts between
0 and 10 percent 10 and 20 percent and
so on
create a histogram with discount bins
and count of discounts and answer the
following questions
how many customers were given discounts
between 0 and 10 percent
what is the total sale recorded when
customers were offered a discount
between 20 and 30 percent
now wasn't that a great experience you
will be happy to know that we have two
more similar scenarios for you to
strengthen your understanding of
organizing and simplifying data
read the scenarios carefully and perform
the task on the Tabo 9 tool downloaded
onto your device
you can evaluate your steps by referring
to the solution guide provided in the
download Center scenario 1.
you work in an e-commerce company's
division that deals with the dispatch
and delivery of shipments is facing
losses
you are required to identify the
customers who mostly tend to return
their orders you need to focus on the
list of customers who have returned
their orders more than half the time
using the sample Superstore Excel sheet
you have to create an appropriate
visualization and answer the following
questions how many customers do you have
on your list
what is the distinct order count for
customer Hillary Holden
which customer has the highest count of
order returns scenario two
you are a store manager of a leading
retail chain in the United States that
wants to launch a discount campaign to
promote the sales of related products as
a part of this campaign you need to
analyze the aggregated sales for
envelopes labels and papers you are
required to see the combined sales of
these products on a graph create a bar
chart showing the accumulated sales for
paper products and answer the following
questions
what is the total sale of paper products
what is the profit ratio for paper
products
this concludes the lesson organizing and
simplifying data also if you're an
aspiring data analyst looking for online
training and certification from the
prestigious universities in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simply transport
strategic program and data analysis from
code University in collaboration with
IBM should be your right choice for more
details on this course click on the link
in the description box below and on the
pin comment right so let's begin with
our topic on mapping right now in terms
of math we've already seen a lot of
examples we've already understood uh how
we can build it on a basic map view in
Tableau all right that Tableau assigns
Geographic roles uh in terms of keys in
the data we can customize the appearance
we can navigate and find locations but
let's go further ahead and understand
certain analysis on how we can use map
layers how we can make use of WMS that
is map web map services so if you
remember earlier as well we discussed on
uh web map services that Tableau
provides so let's understand uh so that
at the end of this particular topic we
will be able to understand how we can
modify locations within tableau
all right how we can import and modify
custom geocoding we can make use of
background images as well as Maps or how
we can describe the geocode locations
within Tableau how we can explore the
geographic search and how we can perform
the fan Zone as well as the lasso and
database radio selection all right so
let's understand now how we can use the
advanced mapping functions and how we
can analyze we already are aware of
building these basic uh Maps so let's
understand further in terms of how we
can create these Geographic roles how we
can modify them how we can modify
locations in taboo right now when we add
in when we uh take in a particular
location all right there can be
instances that taboo will not be able to
identify uh in our data the location all
right so in that case it provides us and
uh gives us a detail of an unrecognized
field okay so that's when we can then
manually set in in the location where
you can edit the location all right and
that's how you can provide and specify
that uh since it's spelled wrong in our
data we can then specify you can see in
this example it's Arizona while actually
the the name of the location is Arizona
and that's how we can then from the drop
down specify and
now click on the unknown location name
and provide it editing all right so in
in terms of such cases all right uh what
Tableau does is you can simply in the
map view as well you have the option
since it does not recognize an uh
unknown field then you can simply click
on uh the uh there is a special
indicator all right so back in our
environment uh if you if you remember
I've mentioned there are indicators that
Tableau provides here at the corner here
if there is something incorrect about
our data all right and then in that case
we can based on that when you click on
that special value dialog box that will
open up uh it will open up the edit
location Tab and that's how you can then
specify and mention about the location
all right so it will give you a unknown
error it will give you a special value
as unknown and that's how you can click
on those values and specify its location
so let's uh consider a scenario now we
have say is profit and quantity which is
an important aspect pretty much obvious
in terms of considering the measures of
the company's performance all right now
there are major fluctuations and uh
because of this they are it's hampering
the Enterprise growth right so the CEO
of the American multinational retail
Corporation he wants to analyze the
sales profit and quantity wherein he
wants to improve the advertising
campaign in those places that are low
performing States all right now for this
he is going to require pretty obvious or
math visualization that can display
these sales profits and the quantitative
values as well all right so let's begin
and see how we can make use of the
analysis now this is going to be a
pretty interesting feature that we're
going to see so
let's begin let me take you to the
environment and see how we
will decrease this particular
with me open up a new sheet here
and let's create a simple map so what
I'm going to do is we need it at a state
level directly double click now we're
already aware when you double click on a
geographic Dimension or Geographic rule
it will automatically identify the and
generate the longitude and the latitude
for us and that's why it shows as
generated values here all right and
right now if you notice you can see a
different map view than that of uh the
one which is specified by Capital the
default one that's because I've changed
it to a different map type so right here
in the map menu that you can see here in
Tableau you have the option of uh uh you
can see the options wherein you can go
to the uh background maps all right and
this is where you have the option of
Tableau or you want to set it as the
current one as a default all right so
you can change and have these locations
now right now uh making use of a
particular map layer and hence you're
not able to see this so any of you were
trying to perform and get this kind of a
view that's only going to be possible
because I've used a map layer which is
inbuilt by Tableau all right so let me
for now uh go to the map options all
right and
I'm going to keep this as no data layer
and this is the kind of view you should
have all right I will discuss this
shortly give me some time and first
let's understand the basics and then I'm
going to come on to this layering now
right now we're just achieving uh the
the scenario that we just read in our
presentation slide deck all right now uh
since we've created The View next that
we're going to do is we're going to have
our sales and I'm going to drag in my
sales to the color shelf all right and
my
uh so now it's changed my view from
symbols into an automatic view which is
a field map so again in this you have
options of a single map and a filled map
so we were already aware of these
options the moment I added up sales to
the color section it's now you're using
a field map option wherein I can Define
the darker the color the higher the
sales the lighter the color the lower
the sales all right so I've dragged in
my sales to color let me add my profits
to the size
all right so now if you notice it's
again changed back to a symbols so uh
the color is determining the sales the
size is determining the profits all
right let's enable the data labels here
for us so it's enabling us the labels
for sales and that's how we can see the
size and based on this we can identify
all right which map or which which state
is having the highest sales in profit
all right so the darker the color the
bigger the size so that means we can
analyze that we have California and we
have New York that are performing better
in terms of sales right so that's how
you can achieve a Statewide
sales
in profit View
foreign
That's How we'll be able to achieve the
sales profit and the values in terms of
a map all right now let us proceed
further in understanding the other
additional uh topics as well so we saw
that we could also modify and create our
map uh in terms of importing as well now
we can also import also Tableau
automatically recognizes and geocodes
our Geographic data when we import uh at
times it fails in assigning the role now
we have discussed this in previous
topics as well so this is more like a
recap where in a data source then we can
actually import and assign the
geographic field in the data we can uh
these should be in a CSV file and that
defines the hierarchies and locations of
our data so that's how it automatically
created the hierarchy all right uh
geocoding uh Alias uh in case if you're
asking what does geocoding mean then it
simply means that Tableau is able to
perform a coding all right in terms of
assigning the geographic roles so let me
take you to the environment and explain
what geocoding means in this case all
right so let me switch tracks to the
environment here all right and let us
now discuss on what are geocodings and
how Tableau automatically assigns on
these roles right so back here in our
data source all right
you can see we have the state City
postal code all right now each of these
are geocoded already it's coded the data
is coded as a geographic field this is
geocoding so this is what Tableau does
it automatically identifies so even in
the connected data as well as special
Fields uh we mentioned and we discussed
that Tableau automatically assigned a
geographic role it provides a role to
the field with the common locations such
as you can see the country the city the
state and the posters and it's provided
coding for it that it's a geographic
thing it's a geographic role and hence
you can see the globe sign here right so
uh again in the drop down then in this
case you can have uh the descriptions in
details and back again in our data as
well all right you can see that uh there
is a geocoding identified by Tableau
automatically so in case when you click
on the drop down here you can see the
geography this is where you can provide
the role of what this particular field
is playing it's the postal code all
right and what is the role whether it's
a personal code so it's automatically
identifying its role all right and in
terms of the data type as well this is
it's taking in the defaults but this is
the geocoding
so let's just automatically assigning
the role and giving a globe icon and
automatically coding the information as
to what value is it Associated whether
it's associated with a postal code
whether it's associated with a state so
hence when I double click it
automatically gave us the state values
so geocoded the values based on its
state latitude and longitude so let's
say on a new sheet this time instead of
state if I click double click on country
all right it's automatically creating
the latitude and longitude all right let
me just quickly again disable my map
viewers here in this case
default so that it does not take it so
now in this case it's geocoded at the
level as you can see we are now seeing
the entire uh for a country all right
with geocoding for the country and
giving us just one simple map that we
have a country data information only for
us hence we can see this one particular
symbol and similarly in terms of State
then it picked up specifically for
United States so every state belonging
in it so that is what geocoding is so
Tableau automatically defines it and in
case if it doesn't then you also have
the option where you can import the
files and you can then specify and
create a custom geocoding also all right
so you can then provide a particular
name so let's see you have an Excel file
in that you will need to then uh custom
specify
so your is taking in the geocodings are
by default but in terms of Customs what
you'll then have to do is you can import
an Excel let's say an Excel file all
right so in that you will have to
specify the say country
as its name right you will have to
specify the state
as well as the latitude
and
longitude
so this is where you can provide your
custom jio coding so if it in bits it
takes in the inbuilt custom coding but
there are times when you want to specify
add your own roles add in a specific
geocoding which is uh extending to the
hierarchy or a new role that's refined
in Tableau then you can also use a
custom geocoding and that's how you can
provide additional details but for
custom geocoding you will then need to
provide the latitude and longitude back
again in your database and in terms of
custom geocoding remember that it needs
to be a DOT CSV file all right it's
wherein it should contain the latitude
and longitude
foreign
all right and these values the latitude
and longitude values these need to be in
the form of real numbers all right
wherein they can indicate at least one
decimal points
one decimal place
so this is one of the criterias when you
want to have a custom geocoding instead
of taking in the in bit where taboo is
automatically creating these generated
Fields all right so going back to the
presentation slides
okay uh if someone taking the
information from a third party map
Source or gets used you're in the
inbuilt uh yes Alias is actually in this
case is generating if you remember these
special fees that we were talking about
uh Tableau works with certain
Specialties like date or like your
Geographic field and your number of
Records all right or number of Records
which is present in the dimensions these
three special Fields Tableau
automatically based on their data uh it
takes in the inbuilt so if you if you
have uh your country and state and all
these details back in your data source
you will notice we do not have any
latitude and longitude
so it automatically does that it
automatically uses built-in and based on
the names the detail it assigns the
roles and it provides the latitude and
longitude so let's say that's when you
want to uh it's it's a it's an amazing
feature provided by Tableau but uh you
do not want to make use of the inbuilt
feature that it's taking in that's how
then you can have your custom geocodings
as well provided in terms of specific
latitude and longitudes but for that
these were the requirements that we
spoke about that then it needs to
contain a CSV file with the latitude and
longitude by default and they need to be
in a real number at least with one
decimal place
so that's the reason when we are working
with them it shows generated
how does the map layer is uh the map
you'll get designed from where is it
taking uh and yes we're going to come on
to that topic so we have a map specific
map menu wherein it's taking right now
at this point of time it's taking the
taboo default map and then we can
specify certain web map servers as well
or then we can also specify certain data
layers that are present in built-in
tablet so we're going to talk about that
and discuss this further ahead so for
now it's taking in the basic the default
that is uh provided so this is the
default symbol and field map that is
provided by tableau
so and right now selecting this as
default and that's when it's taking in a
symbol or a field
uh when you're talking of role it's
assigning a geographic role to our data
it is automatically identifying and
providing it a role so there are times
when it might not provide and that's
when we can then specify that all right
my postal code here means a postal code
let's say it assumed and took it a city
So based on the data it automatically
identifies the role it's playing for
that particular field whether it's a
Country Role whether it's a Latitude a
longitude a state and so on so in case
if it's not identified it correctly we
still have the choice to change these
so that is what we're talking about in
terms of those
all right so going back to the
presentation slides we can hence instead
of the uh inbuilt ones we can make use
of custom geocodings as well and we can
modify so here are in the examples uh
now we uh you can see that we have
German postcodes and hence you need to
provide the latitude and longitude of
CSV file containing decimal values real
numbers and that's how it will then plot
in our data so we can make use of Excel
files import German postal codes and
Tableau and also make use of it so right
now default inbuilt because we have our
data based on uh us is how it's taking
in the data so when you want to have
custom geopodings then you need to
provide this latitude and knowledge
so first up what exactly is data
blending
so data blending is a method for
combining data from multiple sources
data blending brings in additional
information from a secondary data source
and displays it with data from the
primary data source directly in the view
so it might be a little complicated to
understand so let us make it a little
simple
let's imagine that you have data some of
your data is present in your SQL
database and some of your data is
present in Excel database or Excel
worksheet and some data is present in
your Cloud say Salesforce so your duty
is to combine all your data from
different sources that is SQL worksheet
Salesforce and work on it so you might
have a question here we already have
joins but joins and relations have their
own limitations or drawbacks so to cover
that app or overcome those issues
Tableau has come up with data blending
now let us take a step further and
understand what exactly I meant by
joining and relationships and data
blending
so as we discussed before the data
blending is a method for combining data
from multiple sources data blending
brings in additional information from a
secondary data source and display
software data from the primary data
source directly in the view yeah this
was a definition you can take a
screenshot of this and you can keep it
for further reference
now as we discussed there are some
existing ways to combine your data such
as relationships joins etc etc and then
we have the data blending option so
first relationships so
why exactly we do not prefer
relationships in a few situations
relationships cannot be formed between
tables from data sources published to
Tableau server or tablely online so
relationships can't be formed based on
calculated Fields when you use data
blending you can create calculation
Fields those are called as data blending
calculations now next thing is the
joints joints combine Tables by adding
more Columns of data across similar row
structures and this can cause data loss
or duplication so when you use joins and
create the relationship between multiple
data sources of multiple tables then
there is a chance that the data can be
duplicated so just imagine that you have
two different tables and the two
different tables have one common field
such as ID so even a student ID has ID
and employee ID has ID if you use a join
then there are chances that you might
get IDs of both employee and students so
that's the duplication right so to avoid
that you can go with a data blending
now data blending unlike relationships
or joints never truly combine the data
instead Blends query each data source
independently the results are aggregated
to the appropriate level then the
results are presented visually together
in the view that's the reason why we use
data blending
now up next
we have the data blending example now
this is where we get into the Practical
mode we'll get back to our data first
and we'll see what kind of data we are
going to use for this particular example
and what are we going to do with that
data in the table view if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
so this is the Excel sheet which has the
car sales data set that we'll be using
today this is the one of the data sets
and we have another data set let me
yeah
so we have another data set which I
personally created so this is a little
similar to the cost data set so I've
created this data set a little bit
similar to the cost sales data set so
that we can use this in these scenarios
of data blending so that you can
understand the concept in a much better
way so we have the following columns the
manufacturer model resale value engine
size horsepower wheelbase fuel capacity
fuel efficiency annual sales and region
and when we come into the bike sales we
have the same kind of columns so we have
the manufacturer model engine size
horsepower fuel capacity fuel efficiency
annual sales and zone so you can see
that this Zone and reaching from the car
sales data set are similar but the name
is different so there's a reason I've
created a different name for this
particular column so that while we are
working on tablet lending will be
actually blending these two columns as a
custom blend
so this is why I have one name this
particular column as zoom and yeah
so far so good I think we are good with
the data set now we'll get back to
Tableau and start working on these data
sets
yeah so now we are on Tab value let's
uh since we're working on Excel let's
create the Excel
and yeah here we got our Excel files
first let's click in card
yeah there we go we have the card data
set over here
and if you see we have got some
additional columns which we don't need
so the actual column we had was this
when when I downloaded the data set this
was the actual column which has a sales
in 2000 actually we had the
16.919 which I multiplied here okay so I
had made some changes to the data set in
the Excel file and I've hidden the
actual data set so we don't need this
one over here so we'll do the hide
option over here as well so that's gone
over here now let's kind of rename this
as annual sales
enter
and we don't need this F column so this
particular F column is created for a
formula on X into sales in 2000 so we
don't need this one as well we'll remove
this height
and the resale value and another F1 here
who will remove this
engine size one
why don't we rename that as engine size
done and do we have any other access
extra things no and annual sales team
here that's gone as well so the region
manufacturer model annual sales resale
value engine size
another engine size okay this was a
problem so uh when you look into the
engine size over here okay and here so
when you look at the engine size here
this is the actual engine size from the
data sets the original one so it is
represented in the form of liter so
basically the car engines are always
represented in the form of liters so 1.8
liter engine 3.5 liter engine but when
you come into bikes they represent the
engine size in the form of CC's that is
cubic centimeters so the bikes have
650cc engine 1030 or yeah 1000 340cc
engine yeah that's how we represent the
engine size in bikes so to make things
similar I have created the engine size
NCC in the form of CC over here you can
see that over here so 1.8 is equals to
100 or 1800 cubic centimeters so we
don't need this particular column here
so we'll eliminate this or we'll hide
this
so far so good we have horsepower engine
size resale value fuel capacity fuel
efficiency region yeah everything is
fine now so now the next step is to add
the second data set or the second data
source so you can do that by selecting
this particular icon over here and
select a new data source or or there is
another way you can enter into your
worksheet and you don't have to enter
into your worksheet you can do that from
here as well you can select the data and
add new data source so these are the
various options you can selected new
data source from here or you can select
a new resource from here or if you're on
the sheet then you can go again to the
data section and you can select the data
source from here as well or you also
have a short key so when you see it
so you have a short key here which says
control okay sorry so you can read it
right on the right hand side of this
particular dialog box Ctrl D you can
directly press Ctrl D and add your new
data source as well so now we'll add the
new data source so since another data
set that you're working on is also an
Excel file will select the Excel file
so that was bike sales and yeah there
you go we have our bike sales data set
right on my screen right now
so in here as well you can see some
access or unnecessary columns so we'll
remove that as well so
we'll hide this we'll hide this
we'll hide this as well
now we have engine size horsepower fuel
capacity efficiency okay we have our
annual sales here
so I've changed a few numbers in this
particular annual sales column these are
not accurate so I've created some random
numbers just so that they're different
from the car sales
so yeah so far so good we have this Zone
over here the regions column from yeah
let me show you that let's go to the
sheet yeah so when you see cars we have
region over here
okay
so when you get into cars we have the
region over here which has the north
south east west and similarly when you
get into bikes we have the soon which
has the north south east west etc etc so
we are now going to create the blending
between the two data sets so we have the
data set over here which is the bike and
we have another data set over here which
is the car so to create a blend let's
get into data and you can see the edit
blend relationships
Row in the dialog box or the option in
the dialog box so uh remember when you
just have one data source just imagine
that you only had cars data set only one
data set or let us remove this
how how do you remove this
close so we just have one data set over
here which is the bike data set so now
when you click on datum you don't have
that option see it you don't have that
option edit blend relationships but but
when you get a different data source
so we have Car Sales over here now let's
get back our
okay did we had the cars over there
sales bike we have we have the bike
sales over here now let's get back our
cars data set
yeah
okay sorry sorry we can we can make the
changes again not a problem so we'll
remove this
we'll rename it
on this note uh
let me tell you guys if you are getting
some errors or if you're getting some
you know kind of troubles while you're
learning it's a sign that you're trying
your best so we have simply learned
Community which has the solutions to
your problems so if you have any
problems while you're learning then you
can directly you know post your query
over there and our team of experts will
be really happy to help you out with the
solutions
sure we have our annual sales over here
and another annual sales which we don't
need to will hide that
we have the manufacturer model annual
sales resale value engine size so I
think we don't need this engine size
which is in the leaders now we'll rename
this
as engine size
great
yeah we are done so we'll get back to
our sheet now when you hover over to
data and
you can find the data plan relationship
option over here so this happens when
you have multiple sources only now let's
click that and you can see we have the
automatic option and the W has
automatically you know found a data
blend option for the columns which have
the same names so we have manufacturer
model and manufacturer and model in both
bikes and cars so we also have the same
names for annual sales engine fuel fuel
efficiency horsepower also so they are
in the measures section that's the
reason the W has ignored them so
and remember that we have regions in
cars and Zone and bikes but we can't
find the relationship over here because
they have different column names to get
a blend between those columns we can
always choose custom so when you choose
custom
have shown over here
um
you need to make some changes I guess
yeah we need to press add icon and from
add you can see the region from the Cars
data set and Zone from bikes data set
select OK and then you can find a blend
relationship between the region from
cars and Zone from bikes
now we have to blend successfully
applied let's select OK and we are done
so let's begin with our operations So
currently we are in bike sales data set
so if we start the operations on bike
sales data set for an example let's
choose Zone into columns and
annual sales into rows
so you can see a little tiny blue tick
over here so this particular little tiny
Bluetick represents that this has now
become your primary data set or primary
data source because you're currently
working on that particular data set now
if you remove the zone and annual sales
and again if your shade is completely NP
and if you enter into the cars data set
and again choose regions and regions on
the columns again the same thing drag
the angle sales into rows like I'm just
showing you if there is some operations
happening with the particular data set
then you can find the Blue Tick icon
which says that you're working on this
particular data set so that's how we see
it now
so this is how you find the you know
sales happening in that particular
region
and uh yeah we can create another sheet
and now we'll see which model has the
biggest engine
let's kind of sorted
so wiper has the biggest engine Dodge
Viper yeah a muscle car of America
now let's create a different sheet now
let's get back into bikes data set
which is the most fuel efficient bike
uh row and model
so now
according to the data set what I created
Multistrada 950 has the biggest mileage
that's great
okay it shouldn't give 50 maybe I think
I entered some wrong value
yeah sv650
or we can actually take a manufacturer
over here and you know
show sv650 belongs to
let's sort it
where is the 3650 yeah sv650 belongs to
Suzuki great
so sv650 has a good mileage next to
Multistrada 950. so this is how you can
use sheets and data from different data
sets now moving forward let's create
some data blending calculations for that
let's create a new sheet
now we have created a new sheet now
let's rename it as data blend
calculations
now we have successfully renamed our
sheet as data blending calculations now
we are in car sales so let's drag the
manufacturer into columns
sales annual sales of the manufacturer
into columns
so we have the report of annual sales of
different car manufacturers over here
for leading and we have Porsche
Subaru Suzuki Hyundai etc etc now let's
get back to bike sales and drag the same
annual sales from the bytes data set in
two rows
so as you can see on my screen you have
the annual sales for cars and bikes
together on one single screen so here we
have Suzuki as well which is a bike
maker and Ford etc etc are the car
makers so other than bikes we have
another 28 nulls which do not belong to
the bike section now our aim is to
create a new calculated field which is
about the data blending calculation so
you can see that a little icon over here
which represents the blend icon
and you can always select that to stop
the blending and you can click on that
to use it as a linking field so that's
how you can use the blend icon now we
are about to create a new calculated
field so you can right click and create
a calculated field or you can always
choose the icon over here and create a
calculated field so now we have the
calculated field over here let's rename
it as data blend calculation now we have
successfully renamed our calculated
field as data blend calculation now
we'll find the sum of sales happening in
cars and bikes so for that we'll be
using the summation
of sales
annual sales
now we have the annual sales sum of
bikes now we'll add the cards one for
that I'll be selecting Plus
and sum of
annual sales of cars
so you can see that we have two sums
over here so we don't need that second
sensor will eliminate that
so we have another bracket over here
which we don't need so we'll eliminate
that as well so now the calculation
field is valid let's click apply and
okay
so now you can see a newly created
calculation field over here with the
icon equals to hashtag which says that
is a calculated field now let's drag
this calculated field into the rows icon
and you can see the sum of uh both sales
happening in this particular segment
here which shows you the sum of sales of
both cars and bikes now you can see that
we have 28 nulls over here right so
we'll should be having all the you know
when you're calculating the sum of
annual sales of both the data sets and
you should be having something over here
so for that we need to make a little
addition over here that's a function Z
and yeah
now after adding set then
okay we lost the sum so we need to add
the sum again
and sum of annual sales
or
we can just add it over here
okay this should be pretty good now we
need to add another ZN over here
and
another sum over here
close the bracket yeah this should be
good yeah the calculation is valid now
let's add apply and okay now we have the
annual sales of both cars and bikes and
Suzuki combined BMW combined as well
so that's how we do the W data planning
operations so with that let's get back
to the presentation mode again
now the next part in our tutorial today
is the data blending versus joins so
what are the differences between data
blending and Joints so this particular
shot data table should explain you the
differences between them so in data
blending the data gets aggregated first
then the data gets combined but we are
in joins the data will be joined first
or combined first then the data is
aggregated and the second difference is
when we use steel blending the data set
is from different data sources but when
you use joints you need to make sure
that the data is coming from a single
Source now when we come into the data
blending again you can only use left
join so you can consider data blending
as an advanced version of joints but
only the left one can be applied but
when we come into joints we have the
different types of joints like left
joint right joint Etc etcetera right we
have different types of joints so that's
how we have a difference between joints
and data blending the fourth difference
is data can be available in different
level of annularity in data blending so
the level of granularity can be
maintained at a different level when you
have or different levels when you use
their blending but when you use joints
all the granularity of all the data
should be maintained at the same level
and the last difference between the both
s data blending sends separate query to
each data set and Aggregates then
performs blending and the last
difference between the both is when you
use data blending the data blending
sends separate query to each data set
then Aggregates them and finally
performs data blending operations but
when you use joins the queries will be
sent to the datas at a row level
so with that let's enter into the next
segment where we will discuss about the
limitations of data blending so the
limitations of data blending are as
follows data blending compromises the
query execution speed and high
granularity so when you have the higher
rate of granularity on your data sets
then obviously the execution speed will
be compromised next while sorting a
calculated field that uses Blended data
that field is not listed in the sorted
field drop down dialog box and the last
limitation is Cube data sources can be
used only as a primary data source to
the blend data in Tableau and cannot be
used as a secondary data source so let's
understand and see how we can form sort
now your sort refers to arranging your
dimension members in a specified order
whether you want to have it as
descending or whether you want to have
it as ascending all right so you can
perform your sort wherein you can sort
directly on the axis on a particular
field or you can do it manually as well
now what capital supports is it supports
computed sorting as well as manual
sorting so I'm going to show you both
these options of how you can sort based
on your computed sorting as well as
manual sorting so let me quickly show
you the options in terms of how you can
sort on your data
all right so now we have region in
column and sales in my rows all right
now you will find the sort option you
can see the sort option already
available in your toolbar in terms of
whether you want to sort your data
either in an ascending or a descending
manner so this is a quick sort all right
you can have your data sorted as an
ascending or a descending Manner and the
moment you've sorted on your data notice
on region and on sales you're able to
see the Sorting sign right it's sorted
in it's performed the quick sort uh and
hence you're able to see the Sorting
sign that has been enabled in terms of
our region and uh see a quick sort that
you can make use of from the toolbar all
right now there is also a way that you
can sort your data manually as well so
that was a quick slot that you can
perform all right so you can allow a
quick sorting but in this case you also
have the option that you can perform a
sorting now when I move on to the axis
here you can see that I can use the
Sorting option here as well and change
the order of sorting all right I can
sort in a descending and ascending
manner so when I hover over you can see
that my data is getting sorted let me
clear the uh sorts all uh together and
then again show you so that when we
hover onto sales you can see that we
have the Sorting that comes up a
floating sorting icon so one is you can
sort from the toolbar the other is a
floating slot icon appears when you
hover onto the axis and you can sort
your data accordingly
all right so that is another way of
doing it and in terms of let's say we
want to manually sort our data as well
so what you can do is then we can simply
use the dates and we can do a computed
sorting so in this case let's say uh in
the drop down you have the option here
that says sort in the drop down payment
region you can click on that this opens
up the computed sorting of the order
that you want in terms of regions
whether you want it as ascending or
descending whether you want it sorted
based on the data source order which is
present in your data source the
alphabetic order all right this is going
to take in the alphabet or whether you
want to use it sorting based on a
particular field so I want to sort it
let's say based on sales aggregation so
how do I want to sort my region and I
can also perform a manual sort where I
can choose that instead of my central is
South and West let's say
I want West right on top
and I want is
West and
pencil I want East probably after South
so I can I manually fought it as well
irrespective of it taking in the
ascending and descending based on the
alphabet or the data source order on the
seats so I can manually sort my data
here as well so this is where I can
perform a manual sort where I can
specify the position of the manual bars
all right
what is the data source order uh diksha
in your data source now if you're
connected to this particular Excel file
right so the Excel file in this case is
a data source and however region is in
terms of our Excel file we are saying
sorted based on that data source order
all right so instead of the alphabet or
instead of the feel of a manual and
think whatever so let's say if your
South is first in your data source and
your central is lost then it's going to
take in that particular ordering and
it's going to sort it based on whatever
is first to last in the data source
Excel so that's how you can sort on your
data as we saw so that that is another
way this works to do with your computed
spotting so one was a quick one where
you can use the toolbar or the access or
then you can click on the drop down fill
of that particular field and based on
that you can perform your computed
sorting as well as the manual sorting
all right now this changes to the level
of sorting because we use the manual one
and we made changes and that's how we
positioned about manually based on the
selections that we wanted let's have a
quick recap so we can sort on the axis
on a specific field or we can do it
manually as well as we saw table
supports computed where we could use the
toolbars or the Axis or we could perform
a manual sort as well when we clicked on
a particular pill we had the option to
manually sort our sales also so here it
comes before sorting when you've done it
on the axis as I said you can hover over
the particular axis of floating icon of
yours and you can sort your data all
right in terms of a specific page you
can then click on the drop down and open
up a sort for that particular field and
decide whether you want to what kind of
sorting you want to enable you want to
sort as ascending or descending what is
the order that you want to use for your
sorting or whether you want a manual
sort the third option available or for
you all in the Sorting window
now that was about sorting
also if you're an aspiring data analyst
looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply transport strategic program and
data analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details on this
course click on the link in the
description box below and on the pen
comment which is special field type or
so in this particular
we are going to be discussing once we
are done once you've completed this
particular lesson you're going to be
able to understand how Tableau works
with date hierarchies in terms of
pivoting date Parts on shelves how you
can differentiate between a discrete and
a continuous date how you can create and
make use of custom dates what are the
dimensions on a fiscal year and how you
can filter on deep Dimensions
dynamically using your relative date
filtering and also understand the
working of date hierarchy with cubes so
that's in store for us for this
particular lesson so let me now move on
and begin with the first topic here now
if you remember previously we had
discussed that in terms of dates Tableau
handles depending on the kind of
database data source that you're using
these relational or a cube data source
it handles and works with the date
differently depending on its data source
all right so you can see it
automatically separates the date field
into multiple levels of time hierarchy
as you can see here
all right so uh if in case when you have
a date it breaks down you can see from
your two quarter on to month to week and
day all right so it creates its own
level of hierarchy here that uh it can
make use of acceptance the entire field
now this is in case when you're using a
file when you're using a relational file
all right so at the end of this we would
also discuss that in case if it's a
multi-dimensional cube file then what
happens so right now we're talking about
the basic Excel sample file and that's
how we've seen that Capital
automatically divides into multiple
levels of time hierarchy all right so in
this case you can see back in on our
Excel you will find that we have the
order date which is a single uh level
and column here that you can see all
right but the moment we pull in that
data so let me show that you in the
repository as well the moment we pull in
this particular data order date all
right uh that's how you can see it
yeah on to our sample Superstore data
Dimension here and it automatically
creates the hierarchy so we've seen this
earlier now that as soon as we add it up
we can drill and we can keep moving
ahead all right so let's understand
let's take up a scenario and discuss on
on how uh dates are dealt with so Jason
Michaels now he is the sales manager of
an apparel manufacturing company now in
uh quarter four the performance uh he
has a performance review meeting which
is uh next week all right and in that
case he needs to present the your over
your sales report wherein he wants to
highlight how his new marketing strategy
that was introduced in this particular
year has increased the sales
considerably all right and for that he
needs to see the sales report initially
at your level and then additionally he
should be able to drill down to the
sales performance at a quarter and
monthly level now let's see uh assuming
that your Jason Michaels here how are we
going to achieve this particular
scenario all right so let me switch on
to my
so I'm gonna move on to my Tableau
environment here wherein I have already
added in the order sheet from the sample
file provided by Tableau now to achieve
that particular scenario what we're
going to be doing is let's first build a
normal view where we can have the order
date and sum of sales all right wherein
then we can proceed further where we can
achieve that achieve a view where uh as
Jason Michaels we will be able to see
the sales at an initial yearly level all
right and then we should be able to
drill down at uh wherein we can show the
sales performance so now since we're
talking about one thing to see a yearly
level with related to time that we want
to see what we're going to do is let's
have our sales and Order date selected
all right and based on this in the show
me option you can see it gives us the
option to create a line now uh that is
one of the best charts that you can make
use of in terms of analyzing something
which is time related which is time
based so whenever you want to analyze
something time related time based your
line charts your line graphs is what is
ideal in terms of choosing the kind of
view all right so here we have the your
order date so if you notice we already
have the order date and Tableau has
automatically created the hierarchy the
level here for us and by default it's
taking in the highest level of the time
hierarchy here so it takes in the uh
level at a yearly level year for our
sales that we can see
now this is how Json will be able to
achieve his view where he can see these
sales at a yearly level for all the
years that are present in the data
source all right now you should be able
to drill down as the uh you know
requirement was that we should be able
to drill at every level in terms of
seeing the performance because we had
introduced a particular plan a
particular sales plan and he wants to
see whether that implementation has been
beneficial so you can simply click on
the plus sign here and that's how now
we've drill down from here to a quarter
level so we are able to see the sales
here for every year divided at a quarter
level all right and then finally we can
drill down even more further by clicking
on the plus sign which can uh then in
terms of uh drilling down to a monthly
level wherein now we can see that we're
able to feel the entire data at a yearly
quarterly and monthly division Year all
right so January February and March that
you're able to see which is the first
quarter in 2011 and that's how you're
able to see your sales across time all
right so that's how Json can achieve
this particular scenario where he can
see the sales over time uh the leap uh
has a question that says how do we get
the plus sign the leap in terms when
we're using the uh relative relational
data source which is sample data source
the moment you drag and drop your order
date onto the columns or any seal it
will automatically give you the plus and
minus sign because uh what happens is
like I mentioned Tableau basically
refers and it deals with date in a
special manner all right so if it's a
it's a relational source it
automatically creates a Time hierarchy
now you can see we don't see any
hierarchy that is created here but what
it has done is it has identified the
role it has identified it is related to
date and time and that is the reason it
has automatically created these levels
of hierarchy for us so in our data
whatever other dates the year or the
quarter based on that Tableau has
automatically identified and created
these hierarchies for us all right so
you can directly the moment you drag and
drop a particular when you drag and drop
the order date or any date related field
coming in from a relational Source you
can automatically see the plus and minus
sign
right I hope that answers your question
so that is how we have Jason who will be
able to achieve where now he can have
the entire let's go back to the demo
let's go back and see so he wanted to
highlight how his new marketing strategy
was introduced and that your increase of
sales all right and he wanted these
initial report at your level and then
finally he should be able to drill it
down to quarter and month and that's
exactly how we could achieve this
scenario so first we created a view with
just yours and the sales and that's how
we can see that there has been a
considerable increase in terms of all
the sales that have been taking place
all right or based on the uh
introduction of the basic program the
marketing strategy that he had
introduced all right so that's how uh
one we've achieved and seen how we can
achieve the scenario and moreover how
Tableau handles the date in terms of
when you're using a relational data
source
so talking about date and time it
handles the details it handles it in a
different way all right and moreover it
also now let's say we have uh in terms
of pivoting the date Parts on the Shelf
all right Tableau also allows us to
Pivot the date part wherein we can pivot
the data granularly levels between our
days week month of quarter all right
where we want to gain a better insight
and we can pivot these dates by simply
placing these keys with different levels
on different shells okay now how that is
going to be achieved I'm going to show
that to you also let me move on to the
Tableau environment here let me add a
new sheet all right now
assume let's say that we have a line or
chart all right that is going to display
these your and uh the your port or the
sales all right so let me first create
that queue let's have our order dates in
columns let's have our sales in rows now
in case if you're not sure whether which
particular Dimension or measure or which
particular field should be placed in
into the columns and rows to create this
view you can simply as I mentioned
earlier as well select multi-select the
fields that you require go to the show
me options and make your selections all
right so that way it will automatically
place up the required fees onto the
columns and rows I'm doing this manually
here so that you can keep getting used
to the tool and get an idea of how it's
created now I'm going to have uh you can
see we have the your we have the sum of
sales now earlier we saw that we
achieved this particular level by
drilling onto the data now instead of
drilling I would also instead color
encode my marks the line here based on
quarter which will give me four lines on
the quarter bases at a yearly level all
right so that's another way that I can
achieve my drilling I can achieve it
based on a color coding using water in
this particular scenario so what we can
do is I can simply click on the order
date and drag it onto the color shelf
here all right and it's now why did it
based on uh sorry it's taken into some
here uh let's have the order date so you
can simply right click you can use the
control option and based on the control
option you can drag this particular pill
and add it up to the color shelf here
and this is how then you can divide you
can have it based at the quarter
you can now see it's encoded the colors
you have a yearly level there are now a
color encoding which is happening at the
quarter level as well all right so this
is how you can separate the particular
view you can separate now you have a
color encoding for your all right uh
which is at a quarterly level that you
can see now the same thing let's say you
want to achieve and you want to have
your yours and your month and quarter
instead all right so you can simply
again pivot back your quarter all right
now you want to have your quarters as
well uh as well as after you want to
analyze and code it with a monthly level
uh in terms of every quarter of that
particular year you can simply pivot
your quarter from your colors marks onto
the rows all right
and you can then add in your you can
simply drill have your month all right
so this is your monthly order date which
you've drilled and then move this bill
directly pivot it from the rows onto the
color shells
all right so that's how you can keep
Drilling and pivoting so we can now have
as you can see we're now having an
analysis of our sales which is happening
at a monthly level for every quarter for
its particular year
so again this is another way of
achieving this particular scenario also
all right
so that's you can pivot dates uh in
Tableau wherein uh first we saw that the
same way we could achieve where we could
have we could create uh the view let me
just take off the product names and have
it back to our original view all right
so uh initially we had created our view
with sales and
so let me have my sales back again in
the row and the drilling all right
so you can see that here it is
separating each of it drilling down at
every your level for every month now
this same view all right in terms of
drilling is what we understood that
Tableau allowed drilling but for it to
give it a better look a better
enhancement in terms of analyzing as
well we can simply then pivot whatever
we had added in so all our years quarter
and months we pivoted them and added
them so we pivoted our quarter to rows
and our month to colors and that's how
it's all in one View and it's easier the
view is much more better in terms of
analyzing it all right so that's how we
can pivot our data and make our data
look even more useful even more
meaningful okay so let's go back to our
presentation slide here and so that's
how we can make use of the pivoting and
make our views enhance our views and
make it better
so we will get started by understanding
the proper definition of the parameter
in w
so what exactly are parameters in w
so parameter will allow you to provide a
value to pass into tablet parameters
allow you to produce scenarios or
options that are not available in your
data or create these values to put it
into your visualization after creation
end users can control the input to see
the results of the parameters effect
so this is a little complex to
understand so let me just break it down
to a simpler version so parameters are
completely similar to filters so when
you apply a filter just imagine that you
wanted to find the sales of top 10
subcategory items so which are easy
phones as a Furniture is it something
else so which are the top 10 items which
are finding me the most profitable sales
so you'll apply that filter to that
particular sheet so what if you wanted
to apply the same filter to 10 sheets
Yeah by brute force method you can do
that and you can apply that to the 10
sheets but what if you had hundreds of
sheets right so in that scenario you
might prefer using parameters because
once you set the parameter you can use
that particular parameter for all the
sheets in your visualization and even
you can use these parameters in your
dashboards as well so I think this was a
little simpler to understand now what
are the use cases that we will be
discussing today in parameters
so there are multiple parameters that
you can use in your day-to-day W usage
so we'll learn the most frequently used
parameters we're going to use the top
end parameters date field parameter
Dynamic measures Dynamic Dimensions
Dynamic measures and dimensions
reference lines and some sets so I hope
so far so good now let's begin with a
practical session so let's get back to W
so we'll be using the superstore data
set we have dates and etc etc columns
which we need for the parameters to be
applied so we'll go with that
so you can see that I've already worked
on some sheets which include the
parameters such as state parameter
Dynamic measures Dynamic Dimensions
Dynamic measures and dimensions
etc etc
so don't worry I'll save this book for
your future reference we'll be creating
new sheets and we'll be applying new
parameters for a better understanding in
a practical way
so for now let's create a new sheet
so you can see the icon by clicking that
you can just enter into the new sheet
now for our reference rate let's rename
it
so we'll rename it as top
and
so we'll be beginning with the top n
parameters so we'll rename it as Stopman
for now enter
here
so for top n let's drag
sales into rows
and
sub category from Dimensions to columns
now we have a bar chart on our screen
let's kind of twist it or change the
orientation yeah now we want to find the
top 10 or top five uh items which are
giving as a top sale so let's kind of
afford it in descending to do so or to
know the top 10 items which are given as
the maximum sales will apply filters
onto it so to apply a filter let's drag
the subcategory into filters and you can
see uh drop down menu or a dialog box
where we can find the option called top
so here we can specify the top IDs or
top items or top categories whatever it
is which are giving us the top sales
so we'll be selecting by field and
inside that we have a top 10
now okay we are not going to create a
parameter right away
yeah we have to create a parameter right
away
now just select
a new name for your parameter
now let's select uh
top n
parameter
hyphen or let's place the number in the
starting for arbitrary identification
okay
now let's select list
now we have
if you remember we had the minimum and
maximum values is 1 200 in the previous
dialog box now let's select that to 10
and here five
or seven now let's select uh
let's do it 15
then
and five now let's rename them
display as
top 15 Now display the 10 as
top 10 and the 5 as
top five
now the parameter is created you can see
the number second top and parameter on
my parameters section over here in the
bottom left corner
now the aggregation is sum by default
now let's select apply and okay
now let us right click the parameter and
select the show parameter icon and here
we have the top 15. now let's try to
select top 10. now you can see that the
sheet has changed the data now we just
have the top 10 subcategory items which
are providing us the maximum number of
sales
now if we kind of Select label and show
marked labels then we have the numbers
right you can see the numbers which are
providing as maximum sales over here
now let's kind of Select F5 here so
that's how the top and parameters Works
in real time now let's continue with the
next type of parameter in our list which
happens to be the date field parameter
for that let's create a new sheet now
let's rename it as date sheet for our
reference
now we have the date sheet over here
Now to create a date parameter we need a
date so we have the order date over here
let's drag that to rows
so now let's select uh profit and let's
drop it down to here now we have the
profit on a particular dates over here
Now to create a date parameter let's
select the icon over here and we have a
create parameter option now let's create
a parameter
now let's rename it as
second hyphen date parameter
I am renaming it as second hyphen
because we have already worked on this
particular sheet and if you have seen
this particular parameter section we
have a date parameter already existing
in my sheet so for that I'm renaming it
as second date parameter for the
reference now we might have a doubt
about selecting the data type for the
dates I'll go with string over here now
let's select the list and add the values
now for a date we have here
as well as quarter
next we'll have months
we'll have a week and we'll also have a
day
so that's our parameter which is number
two date parameter let's select ok so
once we have created the date parameter
the next step is to create a calculated
field so this particular calculation
field will help us with the calculation
of days quarters months weeks and years
now let's rename this as well
rename it as to date
calculation
yep
now in this particular tray we'll be
writing the formula you can see that we
already have a date calculation over
here let's try to see the formula over
there
so here we are we have the date
parameter and here quarter month weekend
daily
and we have the order date parameter
over here or the date and this
particular hyphen queue is used for
dividing the ear into quarters now we're
going to use the same formula
now let's create a new calculated field
now let's select case
and remember the date parameter we
created in the parameter section you
need to drag that in
so that's dragged now let's paste the
formula
and and
so there you go we have the parameter
dragged into the calculation field and
we have the calculation for year quarter
month weekend day and we have the
calculation is valid notification over
here now let's just select ok
now they go in
in the measure segment or
here
yeah there you go in the dimension
segment we have the date calculation
field available
okay now we have the sales and aovis
data over here let's change the type of
graph to bar graph
let's change the orientation
yeah
now let's select the label option to
provide us the details of sales
there you go you have the sales now
let's select the date parameter show
parameter option and we have the eoy
sales now let's select that to quarter
so the parameters is shown on the right
hand column so you can see the sales are
according to here now when you select
quarter you have the quarters when you
select month you have month-wise sales
and when you have week week wise sales
and finally the day by sales
so you can see that on the 18th of March
2014 we have the maximum amount of sales
so that's how you do it now moving ahead
we have the dynamic measures and dynamic
Dimensions once we are done with the
dynamic measures and dimensions we'll
also execute Dynamic measures and
dimensions together then we'll continue
with reference lines and sets let's get
back to tablet so what exactly are
Dynamic Dimensions so you can see that
on the left hand column we have so many
dimensions over here so we'll be
creating a filter and we'll be passing
all the dimensions or the number of
Dimensions what we want on our filter to
be so we'll pass those number of
Dimensions into the filter and for the
same we'll be creating a parameter and
we'll be running all the values of
Dimensions through that parameter now
let's go ahead and create a new
parameter let's select the icon create a
parameter and now we are in the new
workbook to avoid confusion so we'll
rename this as
dynamic
dimensions
parameter
we'll select the data type as string
current value
and list and inside the list let's write
in the category shift mode and segment
let's select OK and you can see that we
have the new parameter over here which
says Dynamic Dimensions parameter
now once the uh parameter is created the
next step is to create a calculation
field let's select the calculated field
option and inside this let's rename this
calculation as
dynamic
Dimension calculation field
and inside the tree let's write in the
formula
now let's write in case
and let's track the newly created
parameter
and now
let's select one
category
then
category
from dimensions
followed by that one
shift mode
then
ship mode
from dimensions
followed by that when
segment
then
segment from dimensions
now and
yeah the calculation is valid let's
apply
okay so you can see that we have a newly
created Dynamic Dimension calculation in
the dimensions section
now we have the newly created Dimension
calculation here we'll drag that to
columns now let's drag sales
to rows
now let's drag the category to columns
so there you go we have the different
categories Furniture office technology
now we have the parameter displayed on
the right hand side now let's select
according to the shift mode so according
to the ship mode we have the first class
second class same day standard class etc
etc and these are the categories
happening in that particular Fields And
if you select the category or parameter
by segment we have these results
consumer corporate and office now this
is how the dynamic Dimension parameter
works now let's get into the dynamic
measure parameter
for that let's create a new sheet we are
in the new sheet now
now Dynamic measures are completely same
to Dynamic Dimensions the only thing
changing here is instead of Dimensions
we'll be dealing with measures now we'll
follow the same steps again first create
a parameter
let's rename this as
dynamic
measures parameter
and in the list we'll be using sales
profit and quantity
let's select OK and that parameter is
done now let's create a calculated field
similar to Dynamic dimensions
let's rename this calculation is dynamic
measures calculation
and inside the tray let's type in case
let's drag the measures parameter
there you go
now
when
we have used sales profit and quantity
so sales
then
sales
when
profit
then
profit
when
quantity
then
quantity
and
yeah the calculation field is valid
apply and okay
now let's make use of show parameter
option so that we can see the parameter
on the right hand corner
now let's select the category from
dimensions
and the newly created Dynamic measures
calculation onto rows
so we have the bar chart over here
now let's select profit so you can see
the profit by
category wise and you can select the
label so that we can have a clear
picture of the numbers
now if we select the quantity we have
the details according to the quantity
now to just make things look a little
better we can drop the category off and
make use of sub category to have a
better visualization on the
subcategories which are bringing as
maximum sales you can rearrange them in
descending order and we can see
binders are giving us maximum profit uh
in the number of quantity in the profit
yeah copiers and in sales we have phones
so that's how we use Dynamic measures in
real now the next part is both Dynamic
measures and dynamic Dimensions together
for that all you need to do is just
select the calculations from Dynamic
measures and drop it down to rows and
dynamic measure Dimension calculations
onto columns we're using both the
calculations together and now let's kind
of use the option of show parameter
where we can see the dynamic Dimension
parameter and dynamic measure parameter
together now when you select category
and sales quantity
now we have both dimensions and measures
here
now let's select the label option so
that we can have a detailed
appearance on numbers now we have the
segments over here consumer corporate
and office when we select sales we have
the sales number when we select profit
we have the profit number when we have
the quantity we have the quantity number
so that's how the dynamic dimensions and
dynamic measures are used in real time
so the next parameter that we will be
dealing with is the reference lines
now we are back on Tableau let's create
a new sheet
now for reference line let's select the
order date
and drop it down to columns and let's
select sales from measures and drop it
down to rows now let's make a change to
here we'll we'll check that today and we
have a line over here
we need the sales and continuous day
format yeah so this is how it looks like
now let's create a new parameter
let's rename this as
date parameter
let's select the data type as date and
current value
and let's select the date as
so according to data set we have the
dates between 2013 to 2018 so select
anything between 2013 to 14
let's select 2014. yeah now let's select
okay
so now we have the newly created date
parameter over here let's select the
show parameter icon now let's get back
to analytics and try to use a line so
we'll use the reference line let's
select table
let's select the type of line
and color
okay
so you can see a reference line over
here which is got created
now let's get back to data once and date
parameter let's edit it once I think we
forgot something important
it's fine here
let's recreate the line again let's use
the reference line table
and here we created a date parameter we
need to select this I think I forgot
that
okay now let's select the type of line
let's select a medium thick line and
dotted line let's select the color as
pink
yeah that should be it let's select okay
now let's select the show parameter
option when we have the date parameter
option over here let's kind of change
the date and once we change the date you
can see there is a shift in the line
so that's how we use the reference line
in real time we have the date parameter
over here this is how we use it now
let's move on to the next option or next
parameter in the list that is the set
parameter for that let's create a new
sheet
now let's drag the sales to columns
the subcategories to rows
now select subcategory and
yeah let's select subcategory from
Dimensions right click and let's use the
create option and from there we'll be
creating a set
let's rename this Set uh the subcategory
set is perfect let's navigate to Top and
inside that let's select by field and
let's select the top and parameter
we are in the subcategory we have
created a new parameter which we had in
the earlier sheet so again let's
navigate to Top and
let's rename this
Now by field
my top end parameter
select ok
now you can see that we have a new set
over here
so now let's select the show parameter
option
and now let's drag the set
into color so that we have different
colors
so that's how you use set in real time
in parameter calculations in Tableau so
now let's discuss the differences
between parameters and W filters
so these are the few differences between
Tableau parameters and Tableau filters
so w parameters are used for static data
and W filters are used for dynamic data
so parameters are implemented to entire
workbook whereas filters are implemented
to only specific sheets so this is what
we discussed in the earlier part so
using parameters cannot select multiple
values but using filters can select
multiple values at a time and parameters
use calculated Fields while filters do
not use calculated fields and finally
parameters support multiple data types
whereas filters did not support multiple
data types
so LOD expression stands for level of
detail expressions in tableau
the LOD Expressions will allow you to
compute values at data source level and
visualization level however LOD
Expressions give you even more control
on the level of granularity that you
want to compute they can be performed at
more granular level that is we use
include LOD expression there a less
granular level where the exclude LOD
expression will be handy and finally and
entirely independent level that is the
fixed LOD expression so in this tutorial
I'll explain you the types of LOD
Expressions you can use in Tableau as
well as when to use them and how to
format them I will also use an example
to demonstrate how to create simple LOD
expressions in Tableau now in this image
you can understand that the aggregation
and granularity levels are inversely
proportional that means as the level of
aggregation or as the level of ordering
in data increases the granularity level
gradually decreases so this particular
example will help you understand the
inverse proportional relation between
the aggregation and granularity now
let's move into the next part where we
will understand the two types of LOD
expressions in W so basically there are
two types of LOD expressions in Tableau
the first one is the row level LOD
expression and the second one is the
view level LOD expression
so in Tableau Expressions referring to
unaggregated data source columns and are
computed for each row in the underlying
table are the row level Expressions so
in row level Expressions the
dimensionality of the expression is
considered to be at the row level only
now the second type of LOD expression
that is the view level LOD expression so
by contrast which is the opposite to row
level the expression is referring to
aggregated data source columns are
computed in the dimensionality defined
by the dimensions in the view in the
view level LOD Expressions the
dimensionality of the Expressions is
confined to the view level only now the
next part is about the syntax of LOD
expressions in w
so as you can see on my screen we have a
sample syntax to be followed for the
level of detail expressions in table U
so we will be following the same kind of
syntax in our real-time examples now
moving ahead we have the types of LOD
expression Center value so basically as
discussed in the definition we have
three different types of LOD expressions
in W so the first one is the include
level of detail expressions in Tableau
the second one is the exclude level of
detail expression centably and finally
the last one that is the fixed level of
detail expressions in Tableau don't
worry we will understand each one of
them in a bit more detail along with a
practical example for a better
understanding
so the first one they include a level of
detail expression the include level of
detail Expressions compute values using
the specified dimensions in the addition
to whatever dimensions are in the view
include level of detail Expressions can
be useful when you want to calculate at
a fine level of detail in the database
and then re-aggregate and show at a
coarsal level of detail in your view
Fields based on include level of detail
Expressions will change as you add or
remove Dimensions from the view now
let's get back to Tableau and try to
execute a simple example for include
level of detail expression
now we are back on Tableau and we are
going to use the sample data set in the
Tableau which is the Superstar dataset
Now to create LOD expressions in Tableau
we have some steps so the first step is
to set up a visualization first so we
need to use the data from the dimensions
and measures and we need to create a
visualization on the sheet and once the
visualization on the sheet is ready then
we are going to create the LOD
expression so for that we are going to
use the analysis button on the toolbar
and then we are going to create a
calculated field and inside the
calculated field we are going to create
our expression for LOD that is the level
of detail so once the calculated field
is set up or the level of detail
expression is set up the third step is
to use the level of detail expression in
the visualization that is we'll be
getting the newly created level of
detail expression field in this
particular Dimensions or measures and
we'll be dragging that into the rows or
columns or we'll be dragging that into
the details tooltips uh text size color
etc etc basically we'll be using that
particular New Field which got generated
using the level of detail expression and
we'll be creating the new visualization
using that particular LOD
now we have a brief idea how to create
an LOD
now let's begin with the first type of
LOD expression that is the include type
of LOD expression now let's try to
rename this sheet
I'll rename it as include LOD
so before getting started I would like
to tell you guys that we will be using
color size label detail so only these
four boxes are only these four shells
will be affecting the level of detail
visualization in real time and the tool
tip and filter Pages etc etc will not be
affecting that much now let's begin with
the first one
now as the first step we are going to
create a visualization on the screen
first
so for that let's drag the region
into columns
now let's drag the sum of sales into
columns
so now we have a bar chart visualization
on my screen which tells about the
number of sales happening in different
different regions so if we have an
example that is Central which is near to
500k and East is around
678k
and similarly South and similarly West
so basically we have created the first
step that is create a visualization on
this sheet now the second step to create
the new calculated field that is the LOD
expression for that we'll be moving to
the analysis button on the menu bar
click that and you can see in the drop
down menu we have the create calculated
field option select that now let's
rename this
now let's rename this as sales per
customer
let's select the region where we have to
write our expression so for that we'll
use the include option
next we have the customer
we'll select the customer name or even
we can select the customer ID let's go
with the customer ID
then
select the sum
of
sales
so we have our LOD expression ready
okay this shows that the calculation has
some errors
yeah this should be resolved
and let's go with customer name and
let's select ok
yeah I think we forgot to mention the
flower bracket at the end
let's try that yeah now the expression
is proper
so the best part of WS if there is an
error in your expression table you will
not allow you to continue with that it
will show a warning over here that's the
best part so now let's consider the ID
back again
yeah they should be fine
now let's select ok so that we have the
new field that is sales per customer in
our Dimensions part
no no the measures part
yeah we have the new field in the
measure spot that is the sales for
customer now the next step is to use
this particular field
and generate the level of details
now we have the newly created field over
here
so that is basically the third part we
are going to do right now
we are going to drag this and place it
into the rows
so we have two different bar charts now
the sales per customer and another bar
chart which is of sales now we are going
to select the sales for customer and
right click on it now we have the drop
down menu and inside that we are going
to select the measure so we have the sum
measure right now as default now we are
going to change that into average
now we have the average sales per
customer according to Regions so the
average sales per customer is
796.9 units and that is in the central
region next we have the east region
South and West so that's how we use the
include level of detail expressions in
tablet now we are done with one example
based on include level of detail
expression let's try to execute another
example
now we have the sheet 2 let's try to
rename it let's rename it include
l o d
hyphen 2.
now in this particular second LOD
Expressions we are going to calculate
the sum of sales on per state basis
now let's move to the analysis button on
the menu bar
let's try to select the create
calculated field option
now let's try to write in the expression
name
average
sales
per
state
now inside the tray let's try to add the
expression
include
state
now sum of sales
now let's try to close the flap bracket
yeah now we have the valid expression
let's just select ok so that we find the
average sales per state option or the
newly created field in the measures
section now let's drag the category into
columns and the newly created average
sales per state into rows and we have
the level of detail visualization on the
screen right now
so the furniture is about 742 units
and the next one is the office which is
seven nineteen thousand units and the
last one is the A36 000 units so this is
the average sales happening in
particular categories so remember we
have three different categories in our
sales Superstore data set which is the
furniture office and Technologies so
these are the average sales happening
now with this we have the calculation
placed on rows shelf and it is
aggregated as an average but we still
have to find the sales Happening by
state so with that we have the
calculation placed on the row shelf and
it is aggregated as an average so the
resulting visualization averages the sum
of sales by state across categories
now let's drag this segment option into
the columns
so when the segment is added to column
shelf and the calculation is moved to
label the LOD expression results update
now you can see how the average summer
sales per state varies across categories
and segments now we have all the bars in
one particular color let's try to change
it by dragging the category into color
so we have different colors for
different categories
now let's try to drag the average sales
per state into color so that we have
different colors again
so this is how it works if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
now with that let's move into the next
type of LOD Expressions that is the
exclude LOD expressions in tableau
so the exclude level of detail
Expressions declare Dimensions to Omit
from The View level of detail
exclude level of detail expressions are
useful for percent of total or
difference from overall average
scenarios they are comparable to such
features as totals and reference lines
exclude level of detail Expressions
cannot be used in row level Expressions
where there are no Dimensions to Omit
but it can be used to modify either a
view level calculation or anything
between that is you can use and exclude
calculation to remove Dimensions from
some other level of detail Expressions
so to understand exclude level of detail
expressions in tab value in a much more
detailed way let's get back to Tableau
and try to execute some examples now we
are back on to Tableau let's create the
exclude level of detail expression
example so I'll be renaming the sheet
exclude
LOD
now we have created a new sheet and
renamed that as exclude LOD now this
particular sheet will be used to
calculate the level of details which
excludes the region from a calculation
of sum of sales now for that let's try
to create a new
calculated field for that let's select
the analysis select create calculated
field now let's rename this as exclude
region
now let's select okay
we didn't write the expression over
there now let's edit it and in the tray
let's write the expression let's select
exclude
and in that let's select region
then
let's write in this sum of
sales
let's close the flower bracket
now let's select ok now we have the new
field over here which is the exclude
region now we'll be using this
particular field to create a new
visualization on the screen
now let's drag the region
two columns
let's drag the sum of sales to columns
now let's track the order
date to rows
now so let's select the month
questions
let's kind of change this chart to bar
chart
now this is more likely good to view
now let's drag the newly created field
that is exclude region onto color
so that we can have different colors
now this particular step will help us to
view the total sales by month without
the regional component
so this is how the exclude level of
detail Expressions will be used in real
time now we can actually make a little
change to this by selecting this one and
right click it or we can go to Colors
directly and right click the colors
and select the edit colors and inside
this we're gonna select
kind of orange to Blue
orange to Blue diverging so that we can
have a good level of visualization now
let's move on to the next type of LOD
expressions in Tableau which happens to
be the fixed level of detail expressions
so the fixed level of detail Expressions
compute a value using the specified
Dimensions without reference to the
dimensions in The View
now let's get back to W and try to
execute an example based on fixed level
of detail expressions in tableview
now we are back on Tableau let's create
a new sheet and rename that sheet as
fixed LOD
let's type an enter yeah
now let's get back to the analysis menu
let's create a calculated field
let's rename this as sales by region
so we have the sales by region over here
now let's get back to the tray and try
to add in our expression so we shall be
using a fixed expression over here
fixed and now let's type in region
and then sum of sales
let's close the flap bracket now the
expression is valid so we have the sales
by region LOD which is the fixed LOD
let's select OK and you can see the
newly created field on the measures
section let's drag the region onto rows
and then let's drag the state into the
region of rows
so now we have a text table now the view
level of the detail is region plus state
but because fixed level of detail
Expressions do not consider view level
of detail the calculation only uses a
dimension referred in the calculation
which in this case is region so because
of this you can see that the values of
the individual states and each region
are identical
if the include keyword has been used in
the level of detail expression instead
of fixed the values would have been a
little different for each state because
W would add the dimension in the
expression that is the region with any
additional Dimensions In The View State
when determining values for the
expression
now with this let's get back to the
presentation again so the next segment
in this particular today for our
discussion is the tables versus LOD
expressions
so now we'll be discussing the
differences between the tables and LOD
Expressions so the first one is filters
filters involved in table calculate
behave like height and filters involved
in LOD calculations behave like exclude
the next difference is
table calculations are generated as
query results whereas the LOD
expressions are generated as a part of
query to the underlying data source the
third difference is stable calculations
are capable to generate either equal or
less granule than the set LOD or level
of detail but whereas on the LOD
Expressions case the level of detail
Expressions can generate results
independent of the set level of detail
the fourth difference between the both
is
table calculations are used as
aggregated measures whereas the level of
detail Expressions can be used in other
constructs the final differences between
the table and LOD Expressions is the
dimensions that control the operations
of a table are separate from the
calculation syntax whereas in the LOD
Expressions Dimensions that control the
operations of an LOD are embedded into
the expression itself
now with that let's continue with the
next part of this particular tutorial
where we will be discussing the
limitations of LOD expressions in
tableau
so following are the limitations of LOD
expressions in Tableau so the first one
is LOD Expressions behave unreliable
views when floating values are involved
so LOD Expressions that reference
floating Point measures tend to behave
in an unreliable fashion when used in a
view that requires a comparison of the
values in the expression
the next one is LOD Expressions will not
be shown in the data source
so the LOD Expressions will not be
available in the data source page when
you are using them in real time followed
by that the next limitation is you
should always keep in mind when
referencing a parameter in a
dimensionality declaration always use
the parameter name and not the parameter
of value
followed by that the next limitation of
LOD expressions in W is with data
blending the linking field from the
primary data source must be in the view
before you can use an LOD expression
from the secondary data source also if
you're an aspiring data analyst looking
for online training and certification
from the prestigious universities in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simply transpose
strategic program and data analysis from
code University in collaboration with
IBM should be your right choice for more
details on this course click on the link
in the description box below and on the
pen comment today we will be building
dashboards from start to finish first
about world population then Health next
we'll build a dashboard about economy
and finally we'll build a dashboard
about business ease I would recommend
getting access to the data set before
you start this tutorial so you can build
along with me if you would like access
to this data set please comment below
and we'll get you access so first we're
going to build a dashboard that revolves
around population so we're going to
build a map based on Country so I'm
going to double click on country and
it's going to map out all the countries
and then on our marks I'm going to
change it to map
so it's a filled in map and we want this
to be colored by population total
now we can see
who contributes the most to population
we're going to label it with population
as well
but you can see that it's labeling it
the total population and what we want to
label it is how much it contributes to
population by percentage so let's add a
table calculation and we're going to
have it do percent of total
based on country
okay so now we can see which countries
contribute what percent
let's also bring the country name onto
the label and let's put it on top so
country names on top now it's getting a
little bit of crowded in here so
we're going to unclick show marks label
and we're just going to show the ones
that we want to see specifically so when
we can right click on China here hover
on Mark label and click always show
and on India
these are our two biggest contributors
we can see that this one's a little bit
darker than the others in that area
and here
here
and that's just a manual way to choose
which ones have indicators and labels
and which ones do not
and we're going to put a note here so
we're going to annotate
area
that explains that
China and India
contribute the most to world population
just calling out
this section of the visualization
and let's name this sheet
so here we have our visualization and
when you hover you can see both the
total population and its percent
contribution and the country name
our next visualization for this
dashboard is going to be
population over time
so
let's bring on our time element but one
trick for bringing on a time element if
we just drag it on so here with the
calendar Mark here if we just drag it on
it'll default
to a discrete version so let's take it
back off
and then we could edit it there but one
thing you could do is if you on a
Windows machine if you right click on it
and drag it on then it will pop up
with the dialog box that allows you to
select what kind of
date value you want to use in the first
place so we're going to use year here
and now we have instead of discrete we
have a continuous axis and we're going
to bring on population total
and we can see that over time one thing
you can do when the value is up so high
in your axis is you can uncheck this box
that says include zero and it will not
always include zero in your axis but
this can be misleading so you can see
that it looks like population growth is
something really dramatic by increasing
that slope of the Y
whereas it really wasn't quite as
dramatic as it seems so as long as it's
communicated well and you're not doing
it to
mislead your users you just need to keep
in mind that this includes xero can
change what your graph is saying so
we're going to not include the zero at
this time
just so that we can focus in on our data
a little bit
now we're going to add our forecast so
we're going to click on forecast and
drag it on
it adds the forecast to our
visualization right there and now we can
right click here
and see forecast result is actual and
forecast
so you can see that the forecast picks
up here in 2012 and pushes out what it
thinks it'll be in 2013 as well you can
change how far out that forecast goes by
right clicking on the line and clicking
forecast option
and we can change it says automatically
the next two years but we could change
it so that it's the next 10 years and
we'll go out into the future up to 2022
you can change prediction intervals or
if you don't want to show them you don't
have to show them and this is just kind
of
a visual guide for those prediction
intervals
okay and then you can also have your
trend line show
where it shows your trend line following
out from where your population growth is
and also the trend line for your
forecast right there
and we'll call this
world population
one more visualization for this
and it's going to be a pie chart so the
pie chart is also going to be based off
of population
so we're going to click on population
and we're going to control click on
country and come over to show me
and click your pie chart
great so I'm going to make this the
entire view so we can see the pie chart
and this is getting really crazy in here
and so I have changed my mind and
instead of country I'm going to drag
region over top of cut
and now we see something a little bit
more manageable so we can see that
here's Asia and it makes up
the biggest piece of the pie and then
here is everybody else so right now
each of these is population total and we
could keep it that way or we could
do what we did last time and change it
to percent of total so that on Hover we
can see the population and the
percentage of population that it
contributes
so for this pie chart we're just going
to show Asia versus everybody else so we
need to make a group and what we'll do
is
select all of these and we're going to
right click and click group
so now we have all those things we
selected and we have other let's edit
our group right click edit group
we're going to rename this group
Asia because
that's all that's in there and we're
going to rename this group the rest of
the world
okay so now we have our group we can
drag it on to label and we can see Asia
and rest of the world and now see how
it's breaking it up into those different
sections that's because we still have
region on our detail right here so we
pull region off now it's just split Asia
rest of the world
we can change our colors
make it a little bit more
visually interesting
and we can still see our percentages
and now let's rename it and then we'll
put it all together on a dashboard
great so let's make our dashboard we
have this new dashboard button down here
and you can choose what sizes you want
so we have a fixed size where you just
select the width and height we have
automatic which will just fill your
screen
and we have a range which has a minimum
size and a maximum size some of the
good things about fixed is that once you
have it you can have it always look that
way so no matter where they're looking
at it you know that it's going to be
laid out the way that you expected
however if somebody's looking out on a
screen that is bigger or smaller than
yours then it doesn't fill up the screen
or it will help screen too much and
they'll have to scroll up and down and
left and right if you have automatic
then it will fit the screen that it's
displayed on however the things that
you've placed might get squished too
close together and then the range gives
you a minimum size and a maximum size
meaning if the screen is too big it
still won't fill up the screen but it
can get closer and then as they get
smaller and smaller screens you at least
know that it will never make it get
smaller than this particular size so
there's some benefits to that as well
where you still have a little bit of
control of what it will look like in the
end great let's bring on our worksheets
and you can see that way you hover it
fills up that space and that's where
it's going to show up you can also
adjust the lines in between different
visualizations for things that need more
space or less bass another important
thing to recognize is that when you
click on a visualization
like this one up here it will tell you
how it's viewing that visualization
within that space so if you click
standard then it will do a standard Fit
versus if you have entire view where it
will make it fit into inside the box
over here we could have fit width
or fit height on some of the
visualizations it doesn't make as much
of a difference however when you have a
visualization that maybe has a lot of
text in it and they need to be able to
scroll you'll want to have it fit width
but you don't want it to fit height
because then it will shove all of that
information into the box and not allow
you to scroll up and down
so if you saw as we drag these on it
took these
Legends and added it to the left here
we can modify that
and make them floating
and drag them next to the visualizations
that they
are relevant to
and
this particular one
it has a couple of things wrong with it
we might not want the title of this to
be region group so we could come in and
we could edit the title and then
maybe just call it region
however I don't think we need this
Legend at all because it's very clearly
marked on the visualization there so you
could also just remove it from the
dashboard
and this one
is telling you how big of a circle
it would need to be before it gets to
that population number so
it belongs to this circle as well but
again is unnecessary potentially because
we have our two population numbers
showing upright as we hover
so we'll remove that as well so at this
point we have a visualization or three
visualizations all on the same page
which is the basics of a dashboard
however we might want to be able to
interact with them a little bit more
than just hovering
and so this is where we should look into
adding filters so we have information
over time we have information by country
and we have some information by region
here one of the quickest things you can
do to add functionality to the dashboard
is by
clicking this uses filter button so if
we click this that means whatever
country we click on here
we'll filter the other visualization
and then you can unselect it
to go back
now that uses filter button actually
creates an action here filter one
generated that it's made on its own now
you can see that when we click on China
it doesn't make a lot of sense to have
this pie chart update based on that
China click because it's just going to
show
duplicated information so it shows the
20 or the 20 here and the 17
billion
and then here it does the same thing
except for it shows a hundred percent
because it's filtered everything else
out of the chart so it now makes up 100
of the circle so that doesn't make a lot
of sense
so there are ways to
format your visualization or your
actions modify your actions so that they
only affect the things that make sense
so we can come here and click edit
we're going to call this country
action
and we want it to
use the population by country sheet and
then modify only the trend
so now when we click on
China
's Trend over time
and it doesn't affect our pie
because that doesn't make sense for it
to affect our pie
we might want to select on our pie
Asia or rest of the world and have that
affect the other visualization so we can
click use this filter here and click
Asia and now it zooms into Asia on our
map and shows us just the Asia world
population Trend and here's rest of the
world and we can see that Asia is grayed
out
and there's the rest of the world and
here's the rest of the world population
we might also want to be able to use
this to filter to a certain year
so if we click use this filter
then we click on 2011.
see these numbers are slightly updating
so this is 19 percent
and we come here 19.5 percent
come down here and we can see that the
pie updates a little bit although it
hasn't been anything dramatic
kind of see it over time
so that's one way to add filters to your
visualization another way
is to use actual filtering instead of
just actions so if we come back here to
our Trend we could take the year we're
going to control click and drag it onto
filters
and now we have a year filter so we
could have it the actual year number so
just look at one year at a time or a
range of dates
so if we click range of dates that makes
this slider
from 2000 to 2012. so if we hit OK
we'll right click and we'll click show
filter we can see it here and as we drag
this
it updates
but kind of messes with our forecast
so let's not do a year filter
in this case
so we could remove filter there
but maybe we want a filter just on this
for the different years so let's drag
year onto the filters we're just going
to do the year number next
and here's all the years we're going to
let all of them be selected for now
and then we're going to show the filter
and here's all of our years
and we can change the way that our quick
filter shows up and we can make it at
like a drop down so they can still
select multiples but it's a drop down or
maybe we want this visualization to be
just one year at a time so we can choose
single value and list and list out all
the years or in a drop down
and we want it to be 2012.
and then we want this to show up on our
dashboard so we come to the dashboard
and we click more options here hover
over filters and we can see the filters
available and we can click year over
year
and now our formatting hasn't passed on
so that's one thing to remember that
formatting it just on the workbook
doesn't necessarily mean that the
formatting will pass over to the
dashboard so I tend to not do any
formatting on the workbooks and just
format it on the dashboards because the
dashboards are what I publish
so we're going to single value drop down
we're going to
add it we're going to move it to the top
so now how we do that
let's talk a little bit about what each
of these sections are come here to
layout
and you can see we have this layout here
item hierarchy so tiled is the whole
screen and inside of that we have a
horizontal
container
and inside this horizontal container
we have another horizontal container and
when you click on something in this View
it shows you where it exists
so we can see this horizontal container
is outlined now and then we change it to
vertical and it outlines this now a
horizontal container allows things to be
side by side and a vertical container
allows things to be out one on top of
the other and so in our vertical
container we see all this extra space
for extra things to be on top of each
other but if we wanted to have it at the
top
we would maybe want things to be able to
be side by side so if we go back to the
dashboard and we grab horizontal and
drag it to the top
it adds a horizontal container up here
and now you can see everything that's
floating kind of stays in the place that
it was even though all the other things
shifted so that's one of the
disadvantages of floating is that you're
kind of just manually choosing
where it will stand
using your X and Y position
and it's not Dynamic so let's give us a
little bit less space up here
we can add a text box into
our horizontal container or we'll say
copy
animation dashboard
we can format it
now we have our title up here and then
we can add our filter
we're going to drag it to be on
inside of our horizontal container but
on the
side here
you give it more or less space
bring our Legends down to places where
they make sense again
perfect and so now we have this that
will affect this
only and show you just 2012 2011 2010.
so we don't want it to affect the trend
because we want the trend to show all of
time and just looking at one year for
this trend that is only at a yearly part
and forecasts into the future doesn't
make any sense but we maybe wanted to
also affect this worksheet so that these
two are in sync and so that the
dashboard is basically for 2012 except
for the trend which shows you the pass
in the future so one way that you can do
that is clicking apply to worksheets
here
and you can choose selected worksheets
and it will show you all the worksheets
in this visualization or in this
dashboard board and you can click show
all worksheets in workbook and then if
there were other worksheets it would
show them so we wanted to do Asia versus
rest of the world and population
contribution by country
okay and that's another way we can
change what year they show so it's only
going to show one year at a time
unless we select all
and then this visualization isn't
affected by it
if we don't want
to click on a country and have it make
the change if we instead want to have a
filter for Country we can do that
by taking country and dragging it onto
filters
we'll have it show off for now
and then when we go back to our
dashboard and we come to this
visualization we can go filters and add
country
and it's just added it side by side
where we had our other filters so that's
a nice feature of Tableau where it can
kind of guess where you might want
things we're going to do multiple value
drop down
and right now
it only affects that visualization and
we can just look at one country at a
time
and we might not want it to affect this
visualization because it doesn't do us
any good to just look at one region in a
pie chart
but maybe we wanted to affect the world
population Trend so we can do the same
thing we did before
and we wanted to affect these two
we'll click ok
and so now
we could look at
all these countries
and that would update both these
visualizations
another thing I like to do on a filter
is customize and click show apply button
and this means we can make all these
changes in here
see I've selected none however these
visualizations aren't updating and then
I wanted to look at Turkey so I found
turkey and then I hit apply and that's
when they update
perfect so now we have a dashboard
complete with filters and actions
we also have a title on our dashboard we
can give it a little bit less space and
some Legends
we have titles on each of these pieces
however if we didn't want a title here
we can click hide title and it will just
show our visualization there and this is
dashboard number one
here's what it looks like in full screen
mode full screen mode is a good
opportunity for you to test it to see
what it will look like to the end user I
press escape and get back out and it
doesn't give you these highlights when
you hover over things that are dashboard
formatting related
you can see that all those extra lines
went away
and it just gives you the opportunity to
test out your dashboard in a more real
way and see how they will use it
instead of giving you the dashboard
editing options next we're going to make
a dashboard revolving around health
information so first we're going to make
a map
about birth rates so we're going to call
it birth rate
rank
and to make a map we're going to double
click on country
and we're going to change it to a map
type so we have a filled map here and
then we're going to bring birth rate
onto color
so let's define our colors a little bit
by clicking on this color part of the
marks card we'll click edit colors and
we're going to change it
to
red and gold
and the idea here is that the red is for
a higher birth rate which is more
associated with countries that have poor
health so we'll hit apply
and now we have our higher birth rate
countries highlighted in red next we're
going to create
a class so we're going to duplicate
birth rate
and let's edit that field
we're going to call it birth rate class
and so we're going to say that anything
that is in the top 50 countries
with the highest birth rate is
categorized it has having an alarming
birth rate so we will
first do the average
birth rate
and then we're going to do a rank on
that
do you see sometimes
when you're Auto completing your
statements it will replace
one of these functions that you have
with the one that you pressed tab for so
if I type if or I start to type if and
then I come here and click on if it
replaced my rank with if so keep an eye
out for that if you're like where did my
thing go it's because I was typing it
right next to it so if I put a space and
then I start to type if and I click if
it will not delete rank so we're going
to say if the rank of average is less
than or equal to 50. so if it's in the
top 50 then
alarming birth rate
else if
and we can take this again
is greater than 50 then
normal over three
always make sure you put on the end also
we didn't necessarily have to have this
else if statement
so if we had just done else normal birth
rate that would have covered all of our
bases so with these if statements just
make sure that you're always getting all
the different options
that you want but in this case we
defined both however we didn't have to
define the second calculation because if
it is not in the top 50 then it's
obviously in the bottom the rest so
we're going to hit OK and then we're
going to put birth rate class onto label
and it's gone around and labeled
everything
and I am seeing alarming birth rate on
everything
so let's see what the problem is
so if we open this back up by right
clicking and clicking edit you can see
it says results are computed a long
table across
so we're going to click default table
calculation here and instead of compute
using automatic we're going to change it
to compute using
country we'll hit OK and hit apply
and that didn't seem to fix it so this
is the first place I would look if it's
not doing what you would expect
so
we'll put it back to automatic okay the
second place I would look is inside of
the table calculation that is created so
when we defined rank here we put a table
calculation on it so when we right click
here we get edit table calculation
and we're going to choose that we want
to do the rate based on
the specific dimension of country
so now we can see
using the logic
the calculation assistance that
we no longer have just alarming birth
rate we have normal birth rate and
alarming birth rate on our screen so we
can close this
and
we are done here but one thing you could
do is
when we have allow labels to overlap
other marks selected then it will make
sure that every label shows up but it
gets super crazy in there so there are
some times where the labels May overlap
a little bit until you'll want to select
this option in our case we don't want
that
and now we have a visualization
showing
birth rate map based on rank our next
visualization
is going to be about
average life expectancy
male versus female
so we're going to do a chart across time
so we're going to click year and bring
it on two columns and we're going to
change it to this year in the continuous
section so now we have an axis
and
we're going to double click on female
life expectancy oh there we go double
click on female life expectancy and then
double click on mail life expectancy so
what that did was made us two charts one
on top of the other but we don't want
that so we'll take this off and we're
going to drag male life expectancy right
onto this axis for the female life
expectancy
and what this has done is made what's
called a blended axis chart so it's not
a dual axis chart where we have another
axis over here for the second
visualization this one is a blended
access chart so they necessarily use the
same axes and they necessarily have the
same kinds of marks so we'll take a look
and see what the difference is there so
if I were to change this to a bar chart
we would have
bar chart for both of them and I can't
Define one separately from the other
change it back to a line chart
and they're both a line chart now if we
go back to when we just had female life
expectancy and we drag male on next to
it and we have two charts now we can
change it to a dual axis and we have one
on top of the other however our axes
don't line up we can see at the top here
is 15K and over here it's 14k so we're
going to synchronize the axis and you
can see
one on top of the other
and we have two marks cards so we could
have this one be a bar chart and that
would be a line chart
so that's some of the differences of
those two we're going to do a blended
axis chart so I'm going to take mail and
drag it here
and we have our Blended access chart and
now you can see the our scale here is
really strange so what it's doing is
it's adding up all of the life
expectancies for all the different
countries instead of averaging it so
we're going to change that by right
clicking on the measure down in this
measure values card hovering over
measure sum and we're going to change it
to average
since I only changed one of them and
they share the same axes it's really
spread out now and it almost looks like
a straight line down there and then
let's change the other
and it should get everything a little
bit more
in sync there we go so now we can see
the average life expectancy over time
which for both of them seems to be going
up
however
it seems to be higher for females
now let's take a look at our analytics
and let's drag on forecast so it's
forecasted out the next two years for
both lines
and we'll bring on Trent
onto linear
and let's change it
to a square so now we see each
individual point for the life expectancy
for our females and males and we can see
what they're expected to be in the
future and our trends
and our next visualization
is going to be a heat map
about
multiple different measures so we'll
just call it a heat map for now and for
our heat map we're going to look at the
different countries so we'll bring
country onto rows and we're going to
look at their
birth rate
so I just double clicked on birth rate
and brought it on we're going to look at
their health expenditure percentage on
GDP so how much they spend on GDP
so when I double clicked on it it did
what we did before where we have a
measures value card and so now whenever
we put measures on here that determines
what goes here because we have our
measured names on columns so every
measure in here their name is going to
define the name of the column and the
values Define what's in the text right
here
great we're also going to bring on
infant mortality rate and the life
expectancy for females
okay
so now it has
change these to not have decimal points
after them which is not as helpful so
we're going to format those
and you can format it field by field so
for birth rate we definitely want to
have
decimals afterwards as a matter of fact
the birth rate is a percentage so
instead of doing a number standard we'll
just go to percentage
and now we don't need to have those
decimals afterwards we can just look at
the birth rate as a rate
and for
percent of GDP for health expenditures
we can come click there and do the same
thing
and for infant mortality rate
okay
and to make this make a little bit more
sense we again need to change it from a
sum
to an average
and for some of these we could
change it from a sum to an average right
inside of
the full for all of these we could
change it from a sum to an average in
the default properties under aggregation
so that it will automatically average it
whenever we bring it out
default is sum
but if we make it automatically average
then we won't have to do that again for
any other visualizations
I won't do that at this time because I
get a little bit confused sometimes when
I don't have my sum on there by default
because that's what I'm so used to
seeing by default great so we now have
a matrix
by country and by our different metrics
here and so we can
take our measure values
and drag it on to color
and we'll make our marks from automatic
to square and it will make our heat map
now what happens with a heat map
is it colors Darkly the higher the
number it is in this case and right now
it's doing it for the whole area so one
percent is obviously much much smaller
than 82 but if we wanted to be able to
look at birth rate independently from
life expectancy we can right click on
the measure values on the color and
click use separate Legends
and so now we have a legend
for each one of these let's change the
colors on those Legends so that we can
see them separately a little bit more
clearly
so we'll change the colors by coming
over here to each of the legends and
we'll leave one the same
but we'll change this one
if we click edit colors you can see our
different palettes
you can see some of them just have one
color others have one color two another
color we used the
Red Gold before
so now you can see that one is changed
we could use another one that goes from
green to blue
great
you can also Define your own
so you can make a custom one that could
go from light to dark and then you can
choose what color you want as your dark
color
so we could pick
a lighter blue and then we see that last
one and now with these separate color
palettes you can quickly see the
difference with birth rate and
bending for on health
and that is our heat map
with separate Legends so let's build
this all into a dashboard now
we're going to call it our health
dashboard
and for Simplicity we're going to make
it automatic so it fills our screen
and then we're going to first bring on
our map
we're going to bring on our health
related map with birth rates then we're
going to bring on our heat map
and we'll bring on our life expectancy
lines
now as we brought on all of our charts
it brought in our Legends here
and we're going to move our Legends up
to the top so let's add a horizontal
container and then let's put our Legends
into the horizontal container
and let's put these ones in order so
life expectancy
oh so birth rate is going to be over
here
great now one thing we can do is make
these
smaller
well that's actually just making that
one bigger huh okay
so it would make them smaller
by making something else bigger or by
adding in a blank space
which would then
help you adjust the size
by taking up the space that you're not
using
another thing to pay attention to is
this fixed width so once you start to
drag the size on something it no longer
is dynamic
so if we unfix that width
so that it's only taking up whatever
space is left oh
and I'm fixed with
and then we can edit the width on this
to be even bigger
then it will squish things over to where
we would like them to be so
that's one of the ways you can add space
or make things the size you would like
them to be now let's take a look at
filters oh before we take a look at
filters I want to look at this map one
more time because I think that it would
be useful for our colors to be a little
bit more
distinct so one quick way to navigate to
your worksheet from your dashboard is to
click this go to sheet button and while
we're here I'm going to click on color
edit colors and we did red and gold and
we're going to change it from this
sequence to a stepped color
and we're going to change it to three
colors so it's going to either be this
color this color this color I want to
hit OK
you can kind of see it's a little bit
more dramatic in our differences and
it's put everything into the three
categories we defined so let's go back
to our dashboard
and we can see the difference there
and now we're going to take a look at
our filters so we want to be able to
filter by country
so let's bring country onto filters
now we're going to allow it to use all
and we're going to
here you can click apply to worksheets
and you can click selected worksheets
and it's going to pop up with all the
worksheets
we're in the whole workbook
and so one disadvantage of doing it on
the worksheet is that you can see all of
the worksheets in the workbook and you
have to differentiate between which ones
are on the dashboard which ones aren't
and these are the three on this
dashboard so we're going to hit OK
and we're also going to do it by year so
when we drag the year onto filters
we're going to
allow them to
choose years so we're going to do
the distinct number of years we'll click
use all
okay
and we're going to apply to the
worksheets
this one with the birth rate and the
average life expectancy male versus
female we're not going to filter down
our line chart by year because we want
to be able to see it over time and if we
filter down the time then we don't get
as much context so we'll hit OK
let's go back to our dashboard
if I click on more options here and
hover over filters you can see that year
filter and that country filter
you should also be able to see both of
those filters on the heat map
because I told it to apply to that one
as well so here's the country oh
I made a mistake let's go back to this
visualization
and
apply to worksheets selected worksheets
see I wanted it to be on the birth rate
and the heat map not the line chart and
I clicked the wrong one
so that was a good test
so when we go here to the heat map
and click down
you can see now we get the year of year
as well so we'll click year of year
let's put it over here
and we're going to make it
a multiple values drop down I'll bring
it over
to the middle
and let's also
get the country's filter
great so now that we have these in here
we don't need this to be so big so let's
edit the width
and make it 300
even smaller
200.
great and let's change our country
to be a single value drop down so you
can pick one at a time and let's also
change it or this year of year since we
can select multiples let's change it so
that
on customize that you show the apply
button
so here since they can only select one
we don't have the apply button because
it will just automatically apply
and here since I can select multiples
we'll let them unselect all and pick
their years and then hit apply and then
you'll see the changes
and you can see that even though I've
selected only 2011 and 2012 you still
see all the years on this line chart as
expected
and there is our health dashboard
our next dashboard is going to have to
do with the economy our first sheet is
going to be
another map that is going to have to do
with overall GDP
and as we usually begin with maps by
double clicking on country
and changing it to a map Mark type
and this time we're going to bring on
GDP onto color
and change it to average
and we can edit the colors
let's this time do a custom diverging so
you get to pick both colors and let's
pick
a little bit lighter
hmm
okay red for there and then we want to
do maybe like a deeper green and that
way you can see who has the highest GDP
which is green we hit apply okay and
then it will eventually get lighter and
lighter until it goes to gray which then
it will lead to Green
okay
and next we're going to make
scatter plot
which we will call GDP versus GDP per
capita
so
GDP or gross domestic product versus
gross domestic product per capita or per
person
and to make a scatter plot
you have one
measure on one axis
and then another measure which is going
to be
GDP per capita which we will now create
on the other axis
so let's start with GDP and we'll hit
duplicate
and let's edit that and we're going to
call it
GDP per capita
and we're going to take
some
of GDP
and divided by the sum
of the total
population total
what is my error
opening parenthesis there we go
and then we have GDP per capita so let's
what this will do is sum up the GDP
across whatever measures we have in
place okay we'll cross whatever
Dimensions we have in place and then sum
up the population for those same
dimensions and then divide it instead of
dividing it per row and then
doing an aggregation on it
so now we're going to bring on GDP per
capita on the rows
and we have the sum of GDP and the GDP
per capita and to make it more than just
one
little Mark on our scatter plot we will
drag on country to detail and now we
have one Mark per country
and you can see some countries have
a high GDP per capita and some countries
have a high GDP overall but not as high
of a GDP per capita
and so on we have some middle of the
road people here so we can change this
from automatic to circles and now
they're dots like you might see on a
scatter plot and you can
drag region
onto color and now we can see our
different regions
and see we see a lot of Reds here
and
it's quick to see
what region things belong in also you
can click to highlight and you can see
all of the Americas highlighted in
context
the next visualization we're going to
make
is going to be
showing how much countries spend on
Health Care
as a part of their GDP so we're going to
rename it
to be GDP on Healthcare
and we're going to look at each of our
countries
and we're going to make a bar chart
that shows
the health expense GDP
and we're going to change this to
average
and we're also going to show the health
expense per capita
over here it shows how much is spent per
person on health
and this
is showing how much
is spent on health
based on GDP
click at the top and click sort and it's
sorting by this first one
and you can see which countries spend
the most of their GDP on health we can
again bring region onto color so we can
see the different regions
highlighted
and
let's bring on labels so
for our different marks cards
we're going to want to control click
this and drag it onto the labels
and we can see that it's a percentage
but it's coming up as a number so we can
right click and click
format right there
and
we're going to change the number to
percentage
maybe just do one decimal place
and then for this one
we're going to control and drag
that onto labels
and maybe we'll change this one to
currency
however if you don't want to change it
to currency
since we aren't sure necessarily what
currency this data set is in
um it's worth checking out what currency
it is in so for now we'll just have it
as a number
and now we're going to customize our
tool tip so we're going to go to the
overall marks card
and we'll click on tooltip and we wanted
to tell us the country in the top so
we'll erase region
and we're going to
erase country label and Center country
and then we're going to put
this country
bends
this percentage
on Healthcare
and if you want to preview it you can
hover or click here on preview and it
will show you an example Marshall Island
spends 2.1 on Health Care we'll hit
enter and then when we hover
tells you the country and it has our
Custom Tool tip on both visualizations
or on both
of the different axes
so let's build our dashboard
we'll bring on our map
we'll bring on our
Health Care
visualization
and our GDP versus GDP per capita
and we'll move our Legends to the top
again
by adding a horizontal container to the
top
and bringing them up here
one thing we can do also
is to give this more space
we can have it go all the way to the top
and these Legends are just side by side
just above the map
and the GDP per capita
scatter type plot
an interesting thing you can do in
Tableau is you can see this outlier of
the United States is making it difficult
to see the rest of the information or to
visualize if there's any Trend there so
you could right click on it and click
exclude and then it will exclude it from
your data set very quickly
and then you'll just click this back
button to get it back
great now let's take a look at filters
we are going to do a single filter
so let's go to this visualization and
we'll bring on country
we'll click use all okay
and we're going to apply it to
worksheets so I showed you how we can
apply it to worksheets here
you can also apply it to worksheets once
it's on the dashboard so if we come here
and look at filters we can see that
countries on the filters for this
visualization but if we come down here
and look at filters
we still see country because it's in the
details of the information so
either way when we add country
since I added it from this visualization
it only affects this visualization
okay
but we want it to affect all on the
worksheet
so we're going to apply to worksheets
and we can click selected worksheets and
we can click all on dashboard
okay
let's bring this over here we're going
to allow them to see all at once and be
able to scroll and select the ones they
want and now
when we select different ones it affects
all three worksheets
we're also going to add an action
for a URL action add action go to URL
and when we click on a country on the
overall GDP map we want it to take us to
the Wikipedia page that talks about the
economy for that country
so that is
this URL and it's going to say Wikipedia
for economy of
now we're going to add our country to
the end
so we hit OK
we have it running on menu so let's
change it to run on select and as soon
as you click it it will take you there
okay so now let's try it
and we can click on Canada
and it will take us to the Wikipedia
page for the economy of Canada
great I'm gonna click on Brazil same
thing
so if we unselect on Brazil then it will
make our map highlighted normally again
we can also use this one to filter the
other visualizations and so we could
click use this filter here and then when
we click on France
it will filter these two other
visualizations to France
you can see that when we filter this
visualization
to a particular country
so if we look at
Germany
Germany wasn't green before on our map
but now it is that happens because our
scale has changed just for the ones
selected
so if we control click France and
Germany and Switzerland
and Austria we now have a scale that
reflects only these countries and the
biggest is going to be the darkest green
or the highest GDP is the darkest green
and the lowest is the lightest pink
and there is our economy dashboard you
can see that we have some nulls on these
visualizations that occurs when we don't
have all of the data for every point
you can ignore those and they won't show
up on the final visualization when you
publish it to server or you can deal
with those by clicking on them and
filtering that data out or showing that
data at the default position which is
showing the null values at zero our
final dashboard is going to be about the
ease of doing business in a country so
our first visualization is going to be a
bar chart which we will call days to
start
so how many days it takes to start a
business is important to know when
you're trying to start a business in a
country and also can be an indicator of
how easy it will be to do business in
that country so let's make a bar chart
that includes every country and then
we're going to bring on days to start a
business
and we will sort it smallest to biggest
and we have some D's for some countries
that don't have
any days so let's filter out those
countries
and we're going to filter it to only
those that have a good Market
we're going to make a calculated field
we're going to Define business Friendly
Market
well
we're going to Define our Market based
on how easy it is to start a business
and how many days it takes so if it
takes less than 25 days to start a
business we'll consider that a good
market and so we're going to do
if
the days to start a business is less
than or equal to 25
then
else if
days to start a business is greater than
25 then
business
might or might not
work
doing sorry less than or equal to 25 or
greater than 25
allows us to be able to Define these two
different markets so we'll hit apply
there
and we're going to filter it
just to a good Market
and we're going to look at
just one year
we'll look at 2012.
our most recent year
and we're going to color it based on
region and we can see which regions tend
to have
the shorter days to start a business
and we're going to move on and build our
next visualization which is also a bar
chart
which we will call ease of business
so we have this ease of business field
and we could bring on the country and we
can bring on ease of business
and we want to
make it a measure so the ease of
business is at this point looking at it
like it's
a string
and we can change that in our default
properties and convert it to a measure
or use it up here and change it to a
measure
when we try to change it to a measure
here it wants to treat it like a string
so it wants to take the minimum or the
maximum but if we here convert it to a
measure then it also automatically made
an account
so the first thing to do
would be to change the data type to a
number
and now
we can change it to a measure and
aggregate it so we could do
like the sum of ease of business
in our use case we're actually going to
do the
average of ease of business and then we
want to have the smallest on the top we
do have some that don't have ease of
business ratings so we're going to
filter that data out
and again we want the year to be 2012
but how we're going to do that is by
coming to this visualization
and by applying this particular year of
2012 so we'll do it on select workbooks
and select ease of business okay
and now this one also has
the year of
and we're going to segment this by
creating another header
we're going to call that
business friendly
and we're going to say
that if the ease of business
is so I guess this is a nice thing to
know so if if we start typing in what we
want to see then we can select it from a
list here but you can also interact
outside of this box so you could just
grab ease of business and drag it into
the dialog box here and that's really
nice so we're going to say if it is
greater than or equal to 1
and less than or equal to
three
then
we're going to say it has the most
business
friendly
regulations
give us a little more room to look at
okay and this statement won't work
because it's saying and what is less
than or equal to three so you have to
have ease of business in both places
and then this should say then and not
the
great so now we're just getting an error
because we don't have an n
so if that's all we wanted to do then
that's what we would do but then we'll
just do another else if
and it's already taken this if statement
goes through one condition at a time so
it's already classified everything
that's between these two numbers and so
now we can just say
if ease of business is
less than or equal to 10
then
we'll call it very very business
friendly regulations
and we'll keep going
elsif ease of business is less than or
equal to 50
then
we're going to call it
moderate
and we're just going to say moderate
business
regulations
use
less than or equal to 150 then
strict
so the reason that this doesn't grab
everything that is less than or equal to
150 is because these sections one to
three and then three or well four to ten
and then 11 to 50 have all been
classified up to this point so it's just
getting everything else
and we're going to finally
say else everything else
is going to be called
not preferred for
business
see if we get any errors calculation is
valid let's see if this works as we
expect so we'll hit apply and we'll
bring business friendly onto our rows
and now it categorizes everything
based on what we said so we want to
Define what order these go in so we're
going to click sort and we want the most
business friendly at the top
then we want moderate then strict then
not preferred okay so we have our top
three that are the most business
friendly and then we've got four through
ten which are very then we've got our
moderate
are strict
and are not preferred
so let's bring region again onto color
and we can see which regions are the
most business friendly
and we have our year of 2012 there and
now we're going to make this even more
useful by adding the business tax rate
onto the label so that you can see that
business friendly is like Singapore but
they have a pretty high tax rate of 27
whereas if you get down to some of these
that are not preferred some of them have
really low tax rates
so let's make sure that we're getting
okay the right tax rate
so
you can see that
27 is definitely not the highest tax
rate that we have for business
but you can also see that there are
places that have
even lower tax rates
like Saudi Arabia
and
we have
eight percent here
it looks like we don't ever go to
that segment decimal place so let's
quickly
format this
thank you
oh
business tax rate is also text
so if we could convert
our data type to
decimal
and then we will
format it
to be a percentage
and we just need the one decimal place
okay
now let's make some annotations so we
could come and click here on this Mark
and then we can annotate that Mark which
will make this dialog box and it's
already filled in here and so we could
use some of this information so I'm
going to copy that
and I'll put some Ed hard returns there
so we're going to say that this country
is the most
business friendly
but has a
business tax rate of and let's grab the
tax rate
and then We'll erase this
I will hit OK
and I've made a typo so Singapore is the
most business friend is not what I meant
to say so I can click edit
business friendly
but has a tax rate of and you can move
this around draws the line to Singapore
which is the mark
that we wanted to annotate so that is an
annotation on a Mark if we wanted to
just make an annotation for the area
then we could
point out that
more business friendly
countries
often have
High
Ness taxes
you can change that size make everything
fit
now we have this second note
where our user can come in and see some
more information about what's being
presented here
great and now we're going to make one
more visualization
and it's going to be
about phone and internet usage
because you may want to know about the
phone and internet trends
when you're looking to start a business
so we're going to do this one over time
so it does not need to have that year
filter on it
and we're doing our continuous our axis
and we're going to look at mobile phone
usage so I double clicked it it shows
mobile phone usage over time
and we're going to change it to average
so that it's averaging it across the
countries and then we're going to bring
on
internet usage so we'll bring it on side
by side so we have two visualizations
and we're going to also make that
average
now we might not want these to share an
axis because they are measured a little
bit differently and so we can make it a
dual axis
that allow them to keep their
independent axes
or you can synchronize the axes
and see them at their rates however the
uses is just a little bit
of a different measurement we can have
one of them be
a bar chart and the other one be a line
let's have this one be the bar chart
okay and then the line is in the front
you can also change which one's in the
front by
coming and clicking
on the axis itself
and you can click move marks to front
and then move that one to the front Okay
and now it's made each of these wide and
there's like a start point and end point
on the axis for the bar and that comes
here under size where they're all fixed
or you could have it be manual where we
can Define the size of the bars so we're
going to make those bars like this
now we can see them going up over time
we can also change the width of the line
itself
make it thicker or thinner
and
we could change the colors here
so let's change it to Orange
since red might apply that it's bad
In some cultures
and now we can see our internet usage
and our phone usage over time and how
it's trending
and so this will all come together on
our new dashboard
which is about
ease of business
you can see that I have a sheet called
use as a business and a dashboard that
I've called is a business but it won't
let you create a dashboard with the same
name
ease of business dashboard
let's have it fit the screen
and
we're going to bring on our
days to start business visual
our ease of business visual
and our phone and internet visual
let's put our Legends at the top again
so I'll make our horizontal
container
and we'll bring our region Legend into
there and then our
measure names for internet versus
mobile phone
and we have a filter that already is
pre-applied to two of the visualizations
called year of year
and it's selected 2012 and if we select
2011
it's only changing this one it's
filtering out all the information for
this visualization and changing this one
to
2011. so let's see why that's happening
if we go to this visualization
and click the go to sheet
we can see year of 2012 is here let's
click show filter
and if we change the filter
to 2011 okay it's not showing up here
and the only filter I can see that could
be removing it is this averages of
business
that is removing anything that is null
so if I pull that off you can see that
we don't seem to have any information
for 2011 for ease of business
and the more years I select I'm not
seeing any
ease of business information
so
we are going to want to set this to
2012 only because that seems to be the
only information that is useful for this
visualization
so let's go back until we're back to the
state we were in
when we started
okay so here we are
now we're going to want to remove this
filter
and we're going to give it its own
filter
that only selects 2012.
that is not connected to the other
filter
so now when we change your view it only
changes this visualization sometimes
that's useful to note sometimes it's
useful to put
let's do a single value
drop down sometimes it's useful to put
this right next to the visualization it
affects
so if we could change it to floating
and just put it like here
that makes it clear that it's just
changing this chart
so that people don't get confused
another thing that we can do that we
should do on all of our visualizations
is
change the titles so that they're more
business or user friendly
great
and
so we have our filter
and let's use this as a filter and that
way we can click on New Zealand and we
can see it's in most business friendly
regulations and we can see it's internet
and phone usage over time
we can click on
a lot of different countries to see
those changes
you can see that
some countries have a steeper change so
some of them have adopted phone and
internet usage and have stayed pretty
similar how whereas other ones have only
really adopted it in the last couple of
years
also if we wanted to filter to just one
country we could do what we did before
and create a country filter
here's another way to go to the sheet
you can click this down arrow and click
go to sheet or you can come over here
you can see that it's highlighting a
visualization over here or a sheet and
whatever sheet I click on is highlighted
over here
and there's this little pop-out Arrow
here that also takes you to the sheet
and we can bring country on
use them all
go back to our dashboard
we'll go to filters and select country
we'll make it a multiple value drop down
we're going to add the apply button and
now we're going to make it apply to all
the visualizations by
clicking apply to workbooks selected
worksheets all on dashboard okay
now we can see that we just want to look
at Afghanistan
okay we can see
how many days it takes to start a
business there it's not preferred for
business and it's internet and phone
usage over time
and those are our four dashboards so as
a review we have made a dashboard on
population
we made one about health we made one
that had to do with our economy and one
that had to do with our ease of doing
business
and also if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learn Sports project program and
data analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details on this
course click on the link in the
description box below and on the pin
comment So currently on my screen what
you can see is the Tableau the Netflix
data sheets the data sources where you
have the Netflix shows movies their
Associated duration uh what kind of
shows or movies are there their release
year are the associated rating
description and key which is the show ID
now this is the unique identifier for
each show in this Netflix title sheet
and with this show ID all other sheets
are related like you know who are the
directors of the show in which country
the show was released
what is the cost of each show all that
information is in this sheet and to
which particular category basically the
listed in category is being listed in
this particular sheets so what we're
going to do is first we are going to
import this sheet into tableau
okay and then create relationship
between them using the Tableau
relationship canvas
so first our the primary transaction
table the sheet in which all the
information related to movies is there
or shows is there is in Netflix titles
and then we will drag
sheet like Netflix cast titles cast now
Tableau has automatically identified the
relationship between the show ID of
titles and show ID of titles cast and it
has made a join
so if you double click this
you can see this relationship
cardinality and the related fields
similarly I'll drag release titles
category
countries and directors
Now by virtue of this all the sheets
have now been joined with Netflix titles
and with this relationship ready we can
start preparing our reports
now let's create a basic report where we
can just glance the data like you know
whatever we were seeing in the Excel how
it looks in w
so you have all the types of movies then
for example I drag the release Here
now first I do not want to consider it
as a
Dimension so I'll just
release year or category per type there
is a release Here and then I'll drop the
listed in
so now these are the categories so per
year the the details of the categories
right and then you can
drag the title and the associated rating
so this is just a view of your data
we can name it as shows listing report
now let's try to create some report for
some
measures some numbers
Etc
so now let's check in which country how
many movies or titles were released you
know what is the count
so first let's drag the
country
so as soon as we dragged the country uh
uh field it is identified that it has
the geographical names and identified
the latitude and longitude details so
Tableau internally does that
automatically and it has identified the
spots across the globe of the relevant
country
now let's drag the listed in on the
color section
now what it is doing is it is showing in
which country what different kind of
uh category wise movies are or shows are
being released like in Sri Lanka
documentaries have been released in
India action and adventure United States
action and adventure like this
now let's
put
account of
the titles right so if you see 247
action adventure movies or shows have
been released in United States
okay so this is one inference by this
particular report you can
identify
so let's save this report as
listed
in
by country
okay now let's create another report
we will call it as the per year
statistical report in this
first I'll put the release years in the
column
now
count of Netflix titles so this is the
count of Netflix titles per year 2017
2016 14. and then count of Netflix
titles in the countries
this is the second bar chart okay now
what I'll do is I'll combine it into one
so one report
we are
moving in the bar creating the bar and
one in the line now I just have to
so we will click on the count of Netflix
titles by country right click Market
dual access
so now as soon as you click click this
both the charts have been combined and
right click over here and say
synchronize access
okay
okay so now if you can see see right in
2017 you had uh 2 303 Netflix releases
across all categories and one one five
nine
titles right one zero six three titles
in 2017. so this is a descending
representation of the count of titles
release per year across category and
across titles
so let's call this as
per year
stats
now let's create another report
number of shows
per title okay
so or or sorry per rating so we will
drag the rating column
and
we will
count of titles
and
unique count of titles and unique count
of show IDs
okay
one is bar and one is line
okay
so this is a report which shows rating
wise titles and the show IDs
so in the tooltip you can see the
listing count of Titus and show ID per
rating
okay so let's call it
shows per rating
now let's create another sheet
call it as
shows
by cast
so in this
what we're going to do is first drag the
cast column on the rows section you have
name all of all the cast and then we
drag the
show ID on the column section and put a
count D and sort it okay
you can remove the null cast and this is
your
sorted order and on the labels section
you can say show Mark labels and you
will see the count return upon care has
done the maximum
so this is the details on this sorted
order that who has done how many shows
okay
then next is
shows by director similar to shows by
cast
drag
director into rows
or differently if you want to prepare
into columns and then count off
show ID
okay sort it
and you can actually filter out the null
director value
and this is the account put the label
so you can see Jan's Twitter has the
maximum shows
okay
then create another report
shows by category
now similarly drag the listed in
in the rows and show ID count
remove the null category
and sort
labels show Mark labels so International
movies are the highest category dramas
the next comedy International TV shows
this way
you have your category
now let's create a dashboard in which we
want to bring combine all these reports
and
take a common view so first let's drag
listed in by country
then
shows by director
also please let's set the size as
automatic
then let's drag shows by category
and shows by cast
now these four reports are on a single
dashboard we will link them to each
other so go to worksheet actions
add action
filter
select dashboard one
only select shows by category here
and in Target dashboard one
except shows by category keep everything
else
and in the source sheet just select
click select
click ok
now whatever category you will select
over here
that related category data will
automatically be shown in other reports
like see International movies across the
globe across countries directors of only
International movies who has done the
maximum
Johnny Tow and uh shows by cast right
that who has done the maximum
International movies or dramas
or comedies
travel has a maximum number of comedies
and then if you see the comedy movies uh
you know these are the count of comedy
movies released across the countries and
the who is the director
another a very interesting report which
you can prepare is that for example you
want to check in which country maximum
duration of uh your
maximum duration of
movies have been released
so
first let's create a measure
remove this
okay
so if you see
maximum duration of the movies or the
entire Netflix content is maximum United
States then in India these many minutes
next is United Kingdom and you can also
change the colors
whatever you feel is as per your
standards or as per the convention you
can change the color combination
so there are multiple ways you can
generate reports and uh hope you have
understood how you can leverage such a
data to create your reports
so today we'll be dealing with the w
project so the first data set that we
will be using for the tablet project is
based on covid-19 data followed by that
we'll have another Project based on the
airline data and finally the third
project will be based on space missions
data now let's begin with our first
project so in this first project we'll
be dealing with the covid-19 data set
and using that data set we'll be getting
some insights so what are those insights
those are what are the total number of
confirmed cases in different nations
what are the total number of recovered
cases in different Nation so we'll be
using the map chart for these and we'll
be finding out the insights about how
are the cases going on in the current
situation or in the current date or year
followed by that we'll also look into
the insights of the confirmed and
recovered cases in India as well
followed by that we'll enter into the
next query where we'll find out the
trend line of covid-19 in the
international level like how it started
how is it going on
and moving forward will create a group
of Indian States and we'll find out the
covet heads there and then we will
discuss about the death rates so highest
death rates at International level and
the least death rates in the
international level then we'll enter
into the next segment where we'll find
out the variation in covid-19 cases
around the world and then finally we'll
discuss the future of covid-19 in the
international levels basically we'll
create a trend line which will give us
the forecast levels of the covid-19 like
is it going to increase or is it going
to decrease or what's going to happen in
the near future so I hope I made myself
clear with the queries or the insights
that we are going to take from the
covid-19 data set using Tableau so
without further Ado let's get started
with the table you
so we are on Tableau right now so we'll
be using an Excel data file
so we'll be using the covid-19 data file
so this particular data set is available
on cattle and if you don't find it there
don't worry we'll be attaching that
particular data set in the description
box below you can use that as well now
let's just select open to get connected
with that particular data
so you can see that we just got
connected with that data and
there will be some
minute errors in the data or there will
be some problem with the data which the
table you might identify and when it
identifies something messy with the data
it will show you an option maybe you
might want to use the data interpreter
so I prefer using that
so whenever I see that particular option
on the left hand side I better use it
for the safer side for being for being
on safe aside with the data and let's
also select these not a problem
yeah so the data got clean now you can
see that over here so to do that you can
also check the review results so when
you click that review results option
then you'll get into this particular
Excel document which will help you with
the changes made to that data set so you
can see that the orange color one says
the data is interpreted as column
headers or field name and the green box
suggests you that data is interpreted as
values in your data source and now you
can see that
there you go
so now we'll get back to W now you can
see that the data has been interpreted
successfully by the W and everything is
uh as expected by the table every every
data element in the data set is as
expecting python taboo and it's really
fine now now we'll check the columns
what we have in our data set right over
here
so we have the serial numbers
observation dates Province State and
Country or region last update and
confirmed death recovered so basically
these three columns will be telling us
the confirmed cases in that particular
region country or state and that the
deaths happen in that region country or
state and recovered rate and the last
update when was the last test done the
latest tested done and in which region
and what's the Absolution date what's
the observation results in that
particular date and the serial numbers
etc etc so we have the clear
understanding of a data set now let's
get started with the first sheet what we
have over here
so according to our first query we had
to find out the total number of
confirmed cases in different nations
so for that we might want to select the
country or region and then
the confound from measures so for that
we'll be selecting the map chart for
this so that we have the data shown in a
more appealing format
so now we have the blue color of map on
our screen right now where the darkest
color shows the maximum number of cases
confirmed and the lighter ones represent
the lower number of cases confirmed now
let's let's make this look a little more
interesting so for that we can select
the edit color options and inside that
let's select the
red to Green
Divergent
yeah this is it red to green white
Divergent and
as you can see the colors are little
opposite right now so we want The
Greener one and the lower side and the
red colored one on the higher side
foreign
so let's select OK and apply and okay so
you can see that the red color now
represents the highest number of cases
and a lighter red one here you can see
the a little touch of red which shows
that the India's got some good amount of
cases as well and in the Brazil and etc
etc so even Russia has a little light
green so this shows it it also has some
good amount of cases not not completely
green though yeah so this is how it
looks now let's rename this sheet as
confined cases
at the international level
now according to our second query
we are supposed to find the total number
of recovered cases in different nations
so now let's create a new sheet for that
now for that we'll be selecting the
country or region and then we'll be
selecting the recovered and hover over
to the show me icon
let's select the Mac for that
now you can see that we have a lot of
recovery happening in India so according
to the stats we get to hear that the
virus which we have in India is a little
you know kind of harmful than
comparatively what we had in China and
other states of the world
or the other nations of the world
so yeah we have a good recovery rate in
India now let's rename the sheet as
recovery
covert cases
in a national level
so I'm naming these sheets separately
because we'll be using these sheets to
create a dashboard at the end now let's
get into the third query what we have
right now is find the total number of
confirmed cases in India and what are
the total number of recovered cases in
India so for that let's create a new
sheet and let's select country or region
and confront
now we'll be selecting the text table
and we have the complete data set right
now we have all the nations over here so
what we are looking for is just India
so for that now we'll drag the country
or region into filters and inside this
we can see we have an option of
selecting India now let's search for
India
g h i so we have India over here let's
select apply and okay so we have the
total number of cases in India now we
can drag the state of province into rows
and all numbers
so in India we have all states and so
all the states have their own confirmed
cases so this is a total confirm state
or confirmed count in India
let's rename the sheet
confirmed
cases
in India
similarly let's find the recovery cases
in India
let's create a new sheet for that
rename it as recovery
cases in India
so now let's select the country or
region
recovery and then
let's close the show me icon and
now let's drag the configuration to
filters then
none select India
apply OK and
let's track this data Province here add
all numbers
yeah so you have the text chart here
which represents the total number of
recovered cases in India according to
the statewise now yeah this looks okay
but we can make it look a little more
appealing so that it's it's more you
know visible and understandable readable
so we can make that happen so let's make
a duplicate of this and Recovery cases
as well
now I would like to change the confirmed
cases in India into a pie chart
which looks a little bit more readable
and understandable let's select the
entire view so that we have a bigger pie
chart and a little bit understandable or
readable let's increase the size a
little bit and let's select the label
and select the show Mark label so that
we have all the numbers over here we can
even select the uh province of state and
drag it into detail so we have the
state's name as well or should we tag it
into label
yeah now the recovered and to label
again yeah there you go we have the
state and we have the confun number over
here
so this is how we can make the data look
a bit more appealing and understandable
so we can see that Maharashtra has a
large number of confirmed cases that's
the biggest state of India so maybe yeah
that's true and now we'll get back to
the duplicate sheet of recovery cases in
India and now let's make it look a bit
more appealing by changing the way the
data looks so for this we can select the
fact and bubble option
now we can see the back bubbles which
show the
recovery States happening in the Indian
State or the recovery cases
so you can see that everything is
looking in blue color a bit difficult to
understand so for that let's drag the
provincial State into color so that we
can have different colors for different
states yeah now this is good we have the
country name and state name this is fine
now we can make it a bit more readable
by dragging the recovered icon into or
the recovered fill into the label so we
have the count of recoveries happening
in that particular State and that
particular country now it's a bit more
readable now we have Maharashtra at the
leading place we have a good recovery in
Maharashtra
yeah that's fine now let's get back to
the presentation mode and see our next
query so can we forecast the trend line
of covid-19 here so how it started how
is it going on so we can do that let's
get back to W again so let's create a
new sheet we have the new sheet over
here let's rename that as trendline
yeah the sheet got renamed now let's
select the observation date from the
Dimensions since we're making a trend
line so let's keep it observation date
or you can even select the last update
let's go with the last update and now
let's select the confirmed fill from
measures
let's select a line chart
or
we can do that from here as well
okay so we're not getting the line chart
so there might be some problem with the
take format over here
so we have to change the data type of
so I think this might be something with
the date
yeah let's select the date fill and
change data type to
date or date and time from string so you
can see we had a string first
so now let's change to date and time now
we'll be getting a proper trend line so
now we have it according to the year so
we can make it according to quarter and
even even in the form of months and so
if you see this a little bit readable
you can keep it that way or you can even
change to days
show
yeah I think there is some problem with
date and time value
so let's keep it in the form of months
it's it's more readable in one screen so
yeah it's good
let's remove this so we have the month
update
now let's go to analytics to create a
trend line and you can select the trend
line and drag it over here and select
the linear option so you can see here
we have the trend line over here which
reads the r squared and P values and
confirmed and we have a formula for that
so basically tablet creates a formula to
create a trend line so which is 5.280
exponent to the power of 8 into month of
last update so pretty pretty complex
formula yet understandable
so this is how you create a trend line
so according to the trends we have
January February the quartus q1 Q to Q3
Q4 and this is the first month of
January so here it is
so in in January we find one
okay this is in billions maybe yeah
maybe even trillions who knows but but
based on the data we have in the last
year we have a decrement of the confirm
cases in January so it's basically
indicating that Corona is basically or
slowly decreasing that's a good sign
now now let's try to find out the trend
line for India
let's duplicate this
so for that let's drag the country into
filters
we have the filter option
select all
no no not all or we might want to select
the Indian icon
yeah let's select apply okay
so now we have the trend line for India
let's kind of rename it
yeah
even even you can see a gradual drop of
Corona in India as well so the number
has decreased in India as well in the
earlier year we had a lot of cases above
30 crores now we have annually 20 crores
that's a good sign in India as well
now let's get back to the presentation
mode and try to select the next query
so according to the next query uh can we
group Indian States and find covid-19
hits yeah we can do that now let's get
back to tably for that
let's create a new sheet and let's
rename it as grouped
so the sheet got renamed now we're going
to select the configure region
or province
now for that uh we can see the create
option over here now inside that let's
select the group
now
we have to create a group of Indian
nations so select Andaman and nicobar
hold Ctrl select Andra Pradesh
now let's select a couple of States we
know which are in India arunachal
Pradesh assume
don't forget to hold the Ctrl key for
this or else the options might vanish
we have Bihar
we have Chandigarh
we have chapterscore
we have the other another
we have Delhi
yeah we are going to just select a
couple of
States uh just to show how um group can
be done
so fetching all the states in this
particular
column would be a little difficult or we
might even miss a few
we have Gujarat
we have haryana
we have Islamabad
jamun Kashmir
and jharkhand
we have Karnataka
we have Kerala
dog luxury
we have madhya Pradesh
Maharashtra
nagaland
we have Punjab
we have Rajasthan
we have Tamil Nadu
with Telangana
we have uttar Pradesh
[Music]
we have West Bengal
and
let's rename the group as
Indian States group
let's select apply and okay so after
selecting the apply option and clicking
ok so we can have a new pill in the
dimensions section that happens to be
Indian States group so what we're gonna
do is drag that bill into detail option
so that we can have the results on our
screen
so there you go these states will be
selected are right over here all the
channel Kashmir ladakh and Punjab
Maharashtra
etc etc and our lakshadweep and the
Andaman and nicobar Islands
right so we have all the states of India
right on our screen
okay
let's expand it a little bit
scrolling on Tableau is a little bit
difficult
I don't know how to select the default
option for the screen
yes um we can see these states I don't
know where the scroller is at
yeah we can always undo what we did in
Tableau so that's the best part
now let's drag the state spell again so
that we can have a perfect map in the
screen right now
yeah I would like to not to mess with it
again it's it's pretty good right now
let's keep it as it is now let's quickly
get back to our presentation and check
out our next query so find the highest
death rates at International level so we
uh we are basically gonna find which
nation or the country has the highest
depth rates and which is a country with
the least amount of death rates so which
is the safest country now let's get back
to table now we're not gonna mess with
this particular sheet let's create a new
sheet
let's rename the sheet as highest death
rates
International intl
let's enter
so the
shade got renamed successfully let's
drag in country
and let's drag in confirm cases
so we have a map over here so w
basically uh kind of selected the map as
default
we can drag the text and
now we can actually change this to
text shot
now let's drag the Imagine names into
rows so we have a little bit more you
know sorted kind of data so you can see
we have the confirmed cases over here
and that trades here now if we kind of
sort it in the descending order
uses
yeah so the
order is being changed now so we have
so we have our charts processed by
Tableau for a better visual so our chart
got rearranged our ordered in the
descending order so with that we have
the highest uh you know deaths and
confirmed cases in U.S so we can even do
that using a parameter where you can
create the top 10 or top five nations
with highest confident and death values
so for that you can
track
both
oh no you need to create a parameter
I think it's not required over here
let's continue with the next
sheet or you can just simply duplicate
this
since the data set is a little huge it
takes a little bit of time
let's rename this
foreign
it's still taking a little bit of time
yeah now I think we can rename it
at least
death rate so now for that we're gonna
rearrange it in the descending order
I'm an ascending order
hello
so yeah after sorting and changing some
layouts we have the least number of
cases or death rates in the country
called Makkah where we have least number
of deaths and least number of content
cases
so with that let's move into the
presentation mode again and in the
presentation mode we have a next query
that says can we find the variation in
covid-19 cases around the world
so for that let's create a new sheet
again
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so after changing some
arrangements or by making an ascending
Arrangement and changing the layout or
the orientation and everything we have
our final result which states that we
have the least number of tests and
confirmations of covid-19 in the country
of Afghanistan
so yeah so we have the credible sorted
arranged data over here on the screen
now let's get back to the presentation
mode and in the presentation mode the
next query that we have to deal with is
can we find the variation in covid-19
cases around the world yeah we can do
that so let's get back to W and create a
new sheet let's rename the sheet as a
variation
of c19
yeah it's done
so to find out the variation of covid-19
we might want to use the boxes and
viscous chart let's select the country
origin pill from dimensions and confined
from measures let's overload to the show
me tab and select the box and whisker
plot
yeah so you can see that we just have
one box office Square over here when you
see something like this happening on
your sheet then directly head over to
analytics and uncheck the aggregate
measures so we have this kind of
visualization maybe we forgot something
so we've got the country or region to be
placed in columns
so when you place it in the column
section then you find out all the
countries and the variation of covid-19
in their region now let's
um sort it in the descending order so
that we can find out the maximum
variation which is happening in France
so of course there are less number of
confirmed cases but there is a lot of
variation which states that they have
something wrong with the climatic
conditions or the weather conditions
there
yeah we have a larger
confirmations and or logic cases in us
but there is some
some data which shows that France is
leading in some variation yeah so um
since we are calculating the variation
of the confirmation of covid-19 presence
we have France in the first place where
it shows that there is a lot of
variation in the confirmed cases in
France rather than us
yeah that's how we can find the
variation of presence of covid-19 in a
particular country
so with that let's move into the next
query so in the next queries can we
forecast the sheet of future and and
reference of covid-19 presence
yes we can do that let's get back to w
for that let's create a new sheet and
rename it as
forecast
of
Co with 19 presence
so the sheet got renamed successfully
now we'll select the observation date
from the dimensions and confirm 12 from
measures
so we'll use them drag it to columns and
the content from
yeah
now we're going to change this okay
there is something wrong with the
observation date so for that let's
select the observation fill and change
the data type to date
yeah so far so good
now let
me let's select this to
day
we can change that to
here
now let's select forecast option here so
this is how it's going to be
so in the year of 2020 we had the
confirmed cases around this number which
is 760 7053
464 so which is nearly
76
370 lakh
and in the 2021 the number got a little
decreased which is
17130 lakh cases and in the end of 2022
which is the forecast we can see there
is a little more drop so it's a good
sign that the covid-19 is getting
decreased so this is the forecast of the
covid-19 presence in India so we can
change the part
to Step One
the line is okay the line is pretty good
no worries on that so basically we're
finished the queries on our presentation
mode
so yeah if we get back to the
presentation mode so all the queries on
the covid-19 data are finished
now let's create a dashboard
yeah we have the dashboard right now so
we can change the layout of dashboard
let me increase the width to 1320 and
decrease the height to 70
or 760 so we have the entire screen
right now
now let's drag in the confirm cases of
international levels and the recovery
cases in of the international level
yeah now we have it okay or let's keep
it in the top and that in the bottom
the trend line of code in the
international level
foreign
level
it takes a little time
it's still taking a little bit more time
I don't know what's wrong
okay
it should be done in some time
let's wait
it's basically taking a lot of time
because we have a lot of data in that
particular sheet uh let's kind of change
that a little
now
let's change the sheet to
or we can just remove this from the
dashboard and select the list let's read
or the top 10 listed threads so we have
the shade right over here we have the
top 10 ones only here yeah this is good
so this is how we can have the dashboard
and now let's create another dashboard
for Indian results
so again let's change the
dimensions of the screen
yeah it's pretty good now let's take the
confirmed cases in India
and drop it over here and we recovery
cases in India and drop it over there
trend lines in India over here
and
then Stitch
in the forecast
somewhere over here
and if we get back to the dashboard one
we can even add the forecast data or the
variation data
somewhere over here
and we can always change the height
so that it's a bit more visible
so we can rename the dashboard
c19
International
dashboard
and this one has
c one nine
ending dashboard
yeah so with that we have finished the
first Project based on the covid-19 data
set now we'll continue with the next
data set that is the airline data set
so now we are in the second project and
the second project is about the airline
data set and in this particular data set
we're going to take the insights which
are as follows what are the total number
of flights which are taking off in a day
from the San Francisco Airport and
followed by that we have the next query
which reads out find the busiest day of
San Francisco Airport we'll be finding
out the top five busiest days in the San
Francisco Airport and followed by that
we'll also find what are the total
number of flights per day in a month
then we'll find out what are the top 10
busiest flight routes then we'll find
out what are the top 10 longest flight
routes from San Francisco Airport then
we have to represent the flights flying
outside the San Francisco
towards different parts of the world
using a map chart
so these are the queries that we'll be
executing in our second project without
further Ado let's get back to the table
you so now we are back on the W
dashboard so let's select our data set
fidgeting
so our data set is somewhere here
yeah this is the air travel data set we
were looking for
now we got our air travel data set
loaded onto w
ow so remember I said about The
Interpreter I'll select that
and show Ali
okay let let the query execute
yeah so The Interpreter query got
executed now the data has been cleaned
we can review the results by clicking on
review results option over here
we have another query executed now so
basically this query will take us to the
Microsoft Excel sheet where our clean
data is readily available for us
there you go we can see that the red
colored data is the data that is
interpreted as column headers or field
names the green color one is the data
interpreted as of values in your data
source so it looks something like this
so we have our data fine over here just
looking fine now when you come into the
root column you have San Francisco to
the other parts of the word for example
we have Los Angeles here
etc etc but we don't have a separate
field for origin and destination so what
we'll be doing is we'll be splitting
this particular column right over here
so let's navigate to the last column
which will show us the root and so you
can right click this
and select the option of Select which
will basically split it into two halves
which will give us the from destination
or the origin of the airplane and the
two or the destination of the plane so
from 2 or the origin destination fields
we have right now over here you can see
that
um so far so good so let's quickly begin
with our worksheet
now we are on the worksheet right now so
what was our first query so our first
query was to find the total number of
flights in a day
so for that we have a simple step so
basically we'll have a particular number
of rows right for the data set what
we've selected we will have some
thousands of data sets so each and every
row is actually a flight
so what we will do is just create a
calculated field and let's name it as
number of rows okay since we are trying
to calculate the total number of slides
Let's uh you know kind of uh not name it
as rows instead we'll name it as flights
inside the calculated field just write
one and it should be done
so you can see the number of slides just
over here just hover down the text and
we'll have the number over here so this
is the total number of flights per day
which takes off from the San Francisco
Airport let's increase the text size so
that it's a bit more visible
yeah that should be it
let's rename this sheet from here I
would I either I would do the renaming
from here because it's a little simple
total number of flights
that should be it now let's get on to
the presentation mode again now let's uh
you know execute the second query find
the busiest day at San Francisco Airport
so to execute the second query uh let's
just simply duplicate the sheet and
rename the sheet as
busiest okay
we can actually schedules of
slides
or no not schedules of flights
number of likes
are
we can rename this as
flights taking off
so when we get the counter flights
taking off then we can actually find the
date which was really busy like the date
with the maximum amount of uh you know
flights taking off that would be the
busiest day so the data type is date by
default that's great now let's drag it
to columns
now the sum of numbers at this place
analysis let's uncheck this to get a map
let's make it by month
or
okay
we don't need this
we don't need this
we don't need this as well
now we have a chart over here let's
change it
to scatter plot Maybe
yeah so we have the chart nowhere is the
only scatter plot thing it's it's really
a scatter plot I don't know what is on
that so right now we need to find out
the busiest days so for that we might
want to drag the date into filter and
let's select the individual dates select
next and inside the top we have the oh
yeah we need to select by field and now
we have the top 10 number of Lights some
yeah we need we need the top 10 flights
so let's select apply we needed top one
but why not top 10 you will select top
10 for that now we have the scatter plot
on my sheet right now
so let's kind of arrange it in the
descending order this shows the uh
highest number of flights or okay
we need
to change this value to sum
yeah it is some
so uh yeah I got to know where we made a
Mystic show inside analysis we were
supposed to aggregate the measures so
that we can get the sum of number of
flights now we have the total number of
flights now let's quickly arrange this
now we have the
3166 3200
3295
yeah so 3295 happens to be our
you know a busiest day in the year 2020
that is the sixth March which had the
maximum number of flights taking off so
we can actually make a set of these
the set of these which happens to be in
the March so March happens to be the
busiest month for San Francisco airport
so with that we have finished the second
query now let's create a new sheet for
our third query let's get back to the
presentation and the third query it
reads that what are the total number of
flights per day in a month so for that
let's get back to w
let's try to rename it
total
flights in a month
so for that let's select date and drag
it to columns and
let's make it to
month
let's remove this
let's remove this
let's remove this as well now let's
check it to day
and now number of flights
so automatically we have a line chart
and we have the flights taking off from
March 1st to March 31st which happens to
be the busiest month for San Francisco
airport now let's just take the show
Mark label so that we have the number of
flights taking off every day so as we
got the result in the previous sheet to
90 or 300
3295 flights on the date of sixth March
or is the third March maybe here that
have sixth much that happened to be the
busiest day of San Francisco airport now
let's get back to the presentation and
check the fourth query so the fourth
query reads what are the top 10 busiest
flash routes for that let's get back to
W again
let's rename the newly created sheet
busiest
now the shade has been replaced or
renamed now to find out the top busiest
routes we need a calculated field to
remove the effects of San Francisco
Airport first
so clean create a calculated chain and
we can name it as
busiest route busy
and now inside the calculated field we
need an if condition then
if
Route 1 split one is equals to
SFO
then
route
2
click two
else Route One
yeah the cancellation is valid let's
apply and okay
foreign
that into rows and now we'll drag the
number of flights to columns
so there we go we have the bar chart
over here let's um you know rearrange it
in descending order so that we get the
you know descending order now we needed
the top 10 or top busiest routes for
that let's drag busy into filters select
top and by field we have top 10 let's
just select apply and okay and we have
the top busiest routes from San
Francisco airport or SFO
now let's get back to the presentation
mode and in the presentation mode the
next query is which are the top longest
flight rules from SFO
so to find out the longest routes we'll
create a new sheet and rename it as
uh
business no not busiest longest longest
routes
yeah the sheet is renamed and you can
see that we have geometry coordinates
zero zero zero one one zero and one one
so these Z okay not zero one one and one
zero coordinates basically provide the
origin information and 0 0 and 0 1
provide the destination information so
we'll be creating a calculated field for
that now let's create a calculated field
so let's rename the calculated field as
origin and inside the origin we'll make
use of make point
and inside make point we'll write down
geometry
coordinates 1 1 and geometry coordinates
will need the geometry coordinates 1 1
and geometric coordinates one zero
separated by comma and then so we have
the origin now let's create another for
destination
we are creating a calculated field
destination
and inside destination we are going to
use the same make point and Geo
metric coordinates 0 0 comma geometric
coordinates 0 1.
and select apply okay
now the origin and destination are
created now we need to create another
calculated field for distance so we'll
write it as distance and inside that
we'll use the distance function
and we'll write origin
comma
destination and will represent
the distance so using kilometers
and select apply okay
now we have the newly created distance
measure in the measure section I will
drag the busy into columns and distance
into rows
okay uh we made something oh there's no
problem we can actually change the
orientation
and now let's rearrange it in the form
of uh descending order
and now we have the um
distance sorted in the descending order
but there is a small change we have to
change the sum
to average
so once you change that you want to
arrange it again now we have the blr
Bangalore as the farthest Airport from
SFO yeah now we might want to drag the
crazy into filters again
now we have the top 10 apply okay so we
have the top 10 longest routes from SFL
so with that we have finished our fifth
query let's get back to presentation
mode and the sixth query represent the
flights flying outside SFO towards
different parts of the world yeah that
can be done let's get back to W again
now for the six query let's create a new
sheet let's name it as
map
flights from SFO
okay so for that let's select the
latitude and longitude and select a map
[Music]
so we have the map right here
now let's change that to map
yeah it's in the map section by default
let's create a calculated field
called lines so we are basically using
lines to represent the flight sticking
from SFO so I'll name it as nine
or we can name it as flights line
okay and inside the calculated field
let's type in
make line and so inside the field let's
make use of make line function and
inside that let's write an origin and
separate it by comma destination
and the calculation is valid apply ok
now we have the newly created flight
line over here
now we'll drag that flat line to detail
now once we drag that flight line to the
detail we have the lines or flights
taking off from SFO to different parts
of the world now we can make it look a
bit more appealing or more informative
by
dragging
the routes are
yeah
into detail
so we have the details of roots and
we can even drag the distance into
detail so when we hover over to the line
we'll have the root and the distance as
well yeah so that's how it is done now
we're basically done with all the
queries now let's create a dashboard
so now let's um you know kind of arrange
the dashboard size convenient to our
monitor so I'll increase it to 1320
width and decrease the high to 760 so
that's the proper size what I'm first
looking for now we'll drag the
details
into the sheet
longest roots
we have the flight sticking off busiest
routes longest route
and total flights
into here
now it looks more readable fine so we
have the busiest routes we have the
longest rules we have the flight
sticking off and the month of March the
busiest month was the March and the
busiest day was 6th of March I don't
know what was so special on that day if
you know it please let me know in the
comment section below
and yeah so totally we created a
dashboard now let's rename the dashboard
as
SFO flight data dashboard
and we are done so we're done with the
second project now let's get back to our
presentation and let's check the last
project that happens to be the space
missions data set
so now we are in the third project which
is based on Space mission's data set so
using this particular data set we're
going to get some insights which are
based on the queries on my screen right
now so we're going to find out what are
the average temperature details of the
launch sites what are the average wind
speed details of the launch sites what
are the average humidity details of the
launch sites so we need all these to uh
you know before launching a satellite or
a rocket into space everything needs to
be in ideal condition so followed by
that we have what are the different
varieties of launch vehicles used by
different companies so there are a lot
many companies if you are from Garmin
sector where you are from private sector
for example
USA military satellites belong to
government and private satellites like
SpaceX yeah and few others next we have
what is the mission status of the
company so we have a list of satellites
launched already right so we need the
emission status of that particular
satellite is it a success successful
launcher was there some failure record
or something like that next at the last
query we have the track records of
launch sites so what are the track
records so what are the successful
launches what are the failure launches
what are The Satellites launched by
different companies etc etc we'll have a
complete track record of that of all the
loan sites which are available in our
data set now without further Ado let's
get back to table you and start the
project
so we are on Tableau now we're going to
extract the data set so the data set we
need is the space missions data set you
can get this in the kaggle or you can
even have the access to this data set
from the description box below select
open to open the data
so yeah the data got successfully loaded
again use The Interpreter and it's a
good habit of using the interpreters to
clean your data and make everything
understandable or look understandable
show all the answers everything is fine
so we're good to go with the data set
what we have in our W right now
now with that let's get back to the
first sheet
now let's check the first query that we
have in our presentation what are the
average temperature details of launch
sites so for that and let's create a new
sheet yeah it's created rename it as AVG
temperatures
or
launch site
temperatures
so now we need the launch site and
select the temperature
and hover over to the show me tab and
let's select the bubbles chart
so now you can see the temperature is in
the sum but we don't need the sum here
we need to change that to average now we
have the average temperatures of the
launch sites now let's kind of Select
label show Marks here
so we can do one more thing we can drag
the temperature onto the
label now
we have the temperature here now let's
again change the measure to average now
we have the average temperatures of the
launch sites in Fahrenheit
yeah that's pretty well
now let's get back to the presentation
and the next query is what are the
average wind speed details of the launch
sites let's get back to Tableau again
let's create a new sheet
launch
site
wind speeds
now let's drag the launch site into
columns and wind speed from measures
into rows and you can see automatically
we have a bar chart but to make it a
little bit more readable let's select
the boxes and viscous chart yeah you
know what to do now go to analysis
uncheck the aggregate measures options
and let's drag the launch site again
onto columns now we have the different
box and whiskers for different sites so
let's kind of arrange it yeah so the
wind speeds at Kennedy Space Center are
here 20 miles and 23 at Vandenberg
and Marshall at nine
yeah so this is the wind speeds at
different launch sites now let's get
back to the presentation mode and now we
have to find the humidity details of
launch sites
so let's get back to tablet we are back
on Tableau let's rename it you mean
launch site
now let's select the repeat now let's
select the launch site and humidity
then a pie chart
the pie chart is really small so we can
select the entire View
now we have the sum of humidity but we
need the average humidity
and now let's
um track humidity onto label and launch
site to label now we have the detail
humidity
no we need to select the
measure to average again and here to
average again
yeah so we have the humidity percentage
of launch sites
on the password over here so with that
we are done now let's get back to
presentation again now our fourth query
which states that what are the different
varieties of launch vehicles used by
different companies for that let's get
back to tableau
now let's create a new sheet
launch vehicle
details
yeah
now this query is pretty straightforward
select company and
vehicle type and we should be done
so there we go we have the company name
and vehicles used for the launching of
satellites process now let's get back to
the presentation mode Let's select the
next query what is the machine status of
companies now let's get back to tableau
let's create a new sheet and rename it
as mission status
now we are back on Tableau now let's
select the company
drag that to columns and the mission
state is to columns and we'll select one
parameter from
measures so that we can get a
good
bar chart side by side bar chart
and now we can drag the company to color
so that we can have different colors for
different companies
so we have the mission details so
SpaceX found a maximum success in the
recent days and a little failures and
yeah Boeing phone good success as well
and some failures so these are the
machine status of different companies
and different satellites as well so we
have even US Air Force here faced some
satellites here some failures and some
satellites it's okay
so now let's get back to presentation
mode
now the sixth query is track records of
launch sites
okay we had the payload as sum so we
change it to count distinct count so now
we have a better observation of failures
and successes over here so as we
discussed in the sixth query now we need
to find the track records of launch
sites
now let's create a new sheet rename it
as track records
and now let's drag the company to
columns and Mission state is to columns
again and now let's drag the
launch site yeah
I think we might want to drag the
mission status to rows
let's create click on
text now let's drag the space missions
count to color
and space mission counter labels
now let's use this one yeah
now we have the stay stats or the
traffic costs of different space centers
or launch sites and we have the failures
and success rates over here
Yeah so basically we have done the last
sheet or last query executed now let's
create a new dashboard
as we always do change the resolution
according to the
monitor we have so I'm going to use
1030 p
and height as 760. now let's drag the
sheets
so we have the launch temperatures
launch wind speeds and launch site
humidity at one place
now the launch vehicles used
mission status
and the track records
which will kind of
drag it here
and this one over here
this little bit over here
and this one over here
so now we can actually you know
select
the track records of Cape Carnival we
have the site temperature we have the
site humidity we have the site wind
speed and the track records of that
particular site and launch Vehicles
launched Mission state is everything on
one single dashboard also if you're an

pin comment today we'll be going over
answers
answers shins for Tableau Plus
opposite first question is what are the
data types supported in Tableau we have
string date date and time numerical
Boolean so true or false and
geographical in Tableau you can tell
what kind of data type you have so when
you're on the data source tab you can
see that this is numerical and this is
string here we have a date we don't have
any date times here that would have the
little clock icon and we also have
geographical these are set by default
and you can change them by clicking on
the icon and say we wanted row ID to
allow text so we'll change it to string
and you can see the icon changes there
the next question has to do with how
will you understand dimensions and
measures so a key thing to remember is
that dimensions are qualitative and
measures are quantitative and if you can
remember those particular words it helps
convey what the interviewer is looking
for so dimensions are qualitative and
you can use them to categorize your data
so for example you can categorize your
data by what country it comes from and
measures are quantitative and can be
aggregated so you can do a sum of sales
or you can do the average profit did you
know that Tableau automatically assigns
each field a data type and a role and
that automatically Aggregates your
measures using some but you can change
what the default aggregation is question
three what do you understand by discrete
and continuous in Tableau so we have
discrete values continuous values
discrete is represented as blue and
continuous is represented as green so
let's look in Tableau when we go to our
worksheet you can see that all of the
dimensions are automatically blue and
all of the measures are green however
you can have a continuous Dimension and
you can have a discrete measure so we
have discrete Dimensions which is a blue
Dimension but also continuous dimensions
and data is a good example of that let's
take a look so we pull on order date we
right now have year and it's making
categories instead of a continuous axis
so it's making a finite list there but
we can change it to be
you can see now it's marked as
continuous here and it's green and we
change it to be an axis instead of
different categories it would be a
continuous axis
so you can also have discrete measures
which are blue measures and continuous
measures in the green so for example
let's say we had a visualization that
had the region and sales
and profit
instead of having an access for profit
maybe we just wanted to have a number
for The Profit listed right next to the
region and then we could have the sales
visualization so what we could do is
change it to a discrete value and put it
next to region and now it's part of the
labels and that's an example of having a
discrete measure
did you know that continuous is infinite
and discrete is finite those are some
key words that you could use also to
describe the difference between
continuous and discrete and also just
remember that discrete is blue and
continuous is green the next question
number four is what are filters and name
the different filters in Tableau so
filters are a way to restrict the data
that allows you to only see the data
that you want to see in your workbook or
dashboard and there are these different
types of filters and they also have a
specific order so if you can remember
the different filters that's helpful but
also if you can remember what order they
apply in that'll get you some definite
bonus points in your interview we have
extract filters that filter the data as
it extracts and it will affect how big
your extract is we also have data source
filters here which will filter the data
out of the data source however the
extract will still be the same size so
let's take a look at this handy
visualization
that Tableau has on their website we
have the order of operations and in blue
we have our filters so extracts is first
and it filters down your extract to just
what you've selected then we have data
source filters that will apply to the
entire data source so any visualization
that uses that data source will have
these filters we also have context
filters which are next which come before
some of these level of details that's
the major difference is that it applies
before some of these sets and
conditional values and then you will do
dimensions and then measures so any
filters that happen on Dimensions happen
before any measure filters the last type
of filter we have is a table calculation
filter which happens after all of the
rest of them and basically just applies
to your visualization just the one
visualization question number five there
are three customer segments in the
superstore data set what presented the
total profits is associated with the
corporate segment perfect so in some
table interviews you may be asked to
build a visualization for our examples
here we'll be using the superstore data
set and if you don't have access to the
superstore data set just comment below
and somebody on the simply learn team
will help you get access to that also
this is a fun opportunity to pause the
video and then you can work on this on
your own and then come back and see if
what you did was the right thing or how
we did it differently also you can
comment below on what your answer is and
we'll see if we can all get the right
thing so let's build this three customer
segments in the superstore data set what
percent of the total profits total
profits is associated with corporate
segment great so we're going to bring on
our segments and we have consumer
corporate and home office and let's
bring on our total profit so I just did
that by double clicking and now it's
just bringing on the sum for each of
those by default but we want to figure
out what percent of the total each of
these are so we can change this to be a
table calculation we can click add table
calculation or we can do a quick table
calculation and find percent of total so
let's go back to our question we wanted
to know the percent of total profits
associated with the corporate segment
and the corporate segment has 32.12
percent of the total profits and here's
our solution with 32.12 so did you get
it right comment below if you got that
what are the different joins in Tableau
give an example so in tableau
you can join your data so if we wanted
to look at orders and tie it to people
we could pull on people and it will give
you this visualization and you can see
all the different joints here and we'll
discuss those in just a second you also
have the opportunity to Union
information which would be if we had
maybe two Excel sheets that had orders
information perhaps one of them had 2012
and one of them had 2013 then you could
take your orders and pull it so you see
that pop-up drag table to Union and
that's another way to add more data and
so those are all worth mentioning let's
take a look at the different kinds of
joints we have our inner join which will
only give you the values that have
matches in both tables are left joined
that will give you all the values in the
left table and its matches in the right
table
and then the right join which will give
you all the values in the right table
and its matches in the left table
the outer join also known as a full
ladder join will give you all the values
in the left and the right table and then
as we discuss the union you can see it's
represented by a more vertical join and
what it does is it adds
adds all the rest of these are about
adding more
but this will add more rows in the same
columns that you had before
if you have the opportunity to draw out
the answer to this question and make
these Venn diagrams it's a really
helpful way for you to explain your
point and it really portrays that you
know what you're talking about what is
the difference between a join and
blending in tableau so I just showed you
how to make a join here and we are
joining an Excel sheet to another Excel
sheet all within the same connection to
that Excel file so when you're joining
data we'll look over here at the joining
side that's when you're bringing two or
more tables within the same data source
and that's how you join it and so um
we're all inside of a data source here
which when I go to sheet1 just has one
data source here called orders whatever
we wanted to call it and that is all
within one data source however let's say
we already had two different data
sources in Tableau and we wanted to
bring together two of them so in this
case it's an oracle table and we brought
in an oracle table and we made a data
source and then also an Excel table that
had a second data source and you can
blend it together to get your combined
data set so the major difference what
you're going to really want to take away
from this is that blending is from two
separate Tableau Data sources
that joining is all within one data
source and it ends up just being one
data source in the end in blending each
data source contains its own set of
dimensions and measures and when you
join it will combine it into one set of
dimensions and measures so let's go back
to our example here let's bring on
people it is automatically said we're
going to join it on region and we're
going to do an inner join that's fine by
me and so we come here
and now we have just one set of
Dimension and measures under orders
however if we were to add a second data
source which we will it'll be an Excel
file and it will be based off of this
rank example
we'll open that up and now when we go to
sheet1 we have two data sources
and if we were to blend this data
together we would still see two separate
sets of data only we would be able to
pull in from this set some information
and we'd pull in from this set some
other information so that's a visual
difference between blending and
question number eight is what is the
difference between a live and an extract
so first we'll talk about live and we'll
say that your dashboard is connected
live to a database and so a live
connection will query that database
every time you open up the dashboard or
visualization so that you're getting the
most recent information each time and
it's useful for if you need information
that's a little bit more real time
however it can be slower especially if
your queries are complicated with an
extract it will run the query beforehand
and store the information on Tableau
server or on your local machine and so
that it's faster to get to however it is
not real-time information so if you had
a refresh of your extract that runs
every day in the morning and then during
the day somebody is made a change to
your database they won't see that change
on your dashboard until the next time
the refresh run
Tableau you can set
if you want the connection to be live or
extract when you first are making your
data source and this is the Tableau
desktop in Tableau public you don't have
that option did you know that that the
reason that extracts are faster is
because Tableau doesn't need to access
the database each time it fills the
visualization and did you know that you
can set up a refresh schedule on Tableau
server in order to be able to see your
extracted data update question nine what
is a calculated field and how will you
create one so if we look at our data set
here
we have the opportunity to see the
difference between order date and shift
date so to create a calculated field
you click create calculated field with
this drop down arrow at the top or you
can right click in white space
create calculated field then you give it
a name and we're going to call it
shipping delay
and we are going to do
a date diff so if you don't see this
dialog box here you can click this Arrow
to see that our date part is day the
start date is order date and the end
date is ship date so to remember how to
create a calculated field it's by
clicking this down arrow and clicking
create calculated field
and then writing your query here
and a calculated field is an additional
field made up using the data that you
already have so we've made a new field
here and it has the equal sign at the
beginning that might be worth mentioning
how to tell if it's a calculated field
or if it was an original field and then
we can bring shipping delay
share and we can see the number of days
that it took between the order date and
the ship date we could also
duplicate a calculated field so now we
have shipping delay copy
and we're going to call this
average shipping delay
and we're going to encapsulate it
inside an average function
and now if we take off the order ID the
order date and the ship date
it's automatically summing up those days
but we can bring on our average shipping
delay
and you can see on average how many days
it took
and let's change
our number here to include decimal
places
so a calculated field is a new field
made from existing data it can be used
to create more robust visualizations and
it does not affect the original data set
for example we made our average delay
function here using data from our
original data set question 10 how can
you display top five and last five sales
in the same view you can show top five
and last five sales for a same Dimension
by creating a set
so let's take a look at doing that here
we have our customers so let's bring on
customer name
and we're going to do it based on profit
so now that we've done it on profit we
can see these are our top five profit
and I've sorted it by profit and here's
our bottom five
and we can create a set by coming and
clicking on the dimension that we want
the set to be based on we'll right click
there and we will
come to create and click set
very nice call this top customers
top buy field top five
sum of profit
now we have a set it makes a set section
here
now we're going to make a second set
off of customer name
create set
bottom customers
bottom
five by sum of profit we'll hit okay and
now we're going to combine these two
sets so I'm going to control click and
then we have both of them selected and
we're going to click create combine set
top and bottom
now we're going to have it include all
members of both sets
and now we can pull top and bottom
customers onto filters and you can see
our top five and our bottom five so if
we control drag profit onto color
then it's colored by that as well so key
thing to remember is that you can use it
sets to create to show both the top and
the bottom in the same visualization and
that you can combine those sets is there
a difference between sets and groups in
Tableau the answer to this is yes you
can describe a group as being simpler
and using only one dimension to
determine the group whereas a set can be
more complex so you could say sets are
more complex and you can use conditions
to create the sets and you can also use
multiple dimensions and measures to
create the sets for example here we
create a group of subcategory so we grab
all of these things together and can
group it and that will be we'll have
copiers and envelopes and then we'll
have one group of all of these together
over here you can create a set that
looks at sales and profits to create a
set so the best way I can describe this
is by looking at what we did here and so
we were able to use dynamic
filtering here to create our sets and
where we'll look at the top five or the
bottom five and let's do the same thing
we did there but use a group so for a
group we could see that these we've
sorted it and we can say one two three
four five this is the top five so we
could create a group that's this paper
clip here and now we have a group of the
top five and it's added that group it
makes a new group customer name group
and it put it on the color for us now
let's go to the bottom and we're going
to go one two three four five and we'll
create our group
so now we have a top five group a bottom
five group so let's name them that and
we'll do that by clicking edit alias
top customers
okay and we'll come here and we'll
rename that
bottom customers
okay and we'll put our top customers on
top and then let's hide all of the
others so we'll click exclude there and
now we have a similar visualization as
we had before for our sets
top bottom however a key difference here
is that we had to go through and select
the top five and the bottom five so
let's say that maybe Cindy all right
let's say Henry Goldwyn has suddenly had
much more positive profit associated
with
it if that changes he's gonna still stay
in our group this group is just using
these customer names to determine who's
in the group so the group is Henry
shirelle Luke Grant and Cindy no matter
if their data changes so say tomorrow
all this data is different it's still
going to put these people into the group
however the sets as you saw before is
based off of The Profit the sum of
profit and who has the top five and who
has the bottom five if Raymond suddenly
has a lot less profit and falls out of
the group then the groups won't pick it
up but the sets will so that's one thing
to remember is that it could be based on
conditions and then you saw how we took
two sets and put them together into our
combined group you could also have a set
that is based off of two different
dimensions or two different measures and
that's how you could put those two sets
together and get Dynamic sets so the
major differences as we saw is that a
group is just based off of one dimension
and a set can have conditions and be
based on off of other dimensions also
you need to know that groups cannot be
used in calculated Fields but set s can
question 12 what is a parameter in
Tableau and give an example a parameter
is a dynamic value that a customer could
select and you can use it to replace
constant values in calculations filters
and reference lines so for example here
we determined we wanted bottom five and
top five customers but let's give them
some options so we'll create a parameter
and we'll call it select
number of
top bottom customers
and we're going to
let it be a range
with a minimum of five and a maximum of
20
and a step size of five so we'll let
them go five at a time
okay
now if we click show parameter control
we can see our parameter control and you
can do 5 10 15 or 20 but since it's not
in any of our calculated fields or sets
or filters then it's not making any
difference so let's put it inside of
these we'll edit our set and instead of
top or bottom five we'll click bottom
select number of top bottom customers so
now it's taking our parameter and
inserting it in
to our set there we'll do the same thing
with top customers
okay and now right now we see top five
bottom five if we change it now we see
top 10 bottom 10 15 and there's our 20.
so it replaces a constant value and
allows the end user to select the value
question 13 what is the difference
between tree maps and heat Maps so let's
first talk about what each of these are
heat Maps compare categories using size
and color I think the biggest thing
about heat Maps is the color sizes
somewhat optional so let's build this
visualization quickly
so
we have region category
and subcategory
and we're making a heat map so we want
to bring profit onto color
and you can see we've got hotter and
colder in this case for a heat map we
might want to change
so in this case what it's doing is
hotter is negative but we could reverse
that and then hotter is positive and so
hotter maybe means this is where more
activity is
we can also double click on profit
we can also bring profit onto label and
we'll change this to square and now it's
marked at what everything is so a heat
map we'll use color to draw your eye to
the places where there's heat or maybe
activity we could also use size in this
case so it's not just defined by color
necessarily maybe we want the size to be
defined by sales so we get things that
are bigger but they're blue which means
that they are bigger in sales but their
profit is negative and it draws your
eyes to technology so machines in the
South are doing a lot of sales but
they're not having positive profit
necessarily also you can see some things
that have darker colors but are smaller
so high profit but not a lot of sales so
that is a heat map a tree map is used to
represent hierarchical data now
hierarchy is the term you need to
remember when you're talking about the
difference between the tree map and a
heat map in the heat map none of these
boxes have to do with the hierarchy with
each other whereas with the tree map you
can see that this box has a thick white
line between it and the other ones and
that means that that section are all
connected so these are all technology
and the bigger this section is that
means the bigger the let's see size is
based off of profit so this bigger
section means that technology has more
profit than Furniture so let's build
this one when I build tree Maps I like
to use our show me tool so here's tree
map and it says one or more Dimensions
or one and one to two measures so we're
gonna grab category and we're going to
control quick subcategory we're going to
control click profit and sales and we'll
click on our tree map perfect and so the
darker the color that means the more
sales there is and that's pretty similar
to our heat map over here so the color
indicated in this case it was profit so
the color indicates the difference and
the size indicates the difference and
that's true over here the color
indicates a difference and the size
indicates a difference however there is
a hierarchy to it over here you can see
that there is
um hierarchies because we have furniture
and then that puts that all together
under furniture and then here's the
subcategories however if you were trying
to compare Furniture to office supplies
it's really difficult to tell which one
has more sales but if we go over to
sheet 7 that has our tree map on it you
can see really quickly that office
supplies has much more sales than
Furniture in this case office supplies
has much more profit than Furniture
biggest difference is that tree maps
have the hierarchy question question
number 14 what is the difference between
twbx and twb so these are all Tableau
file formats and the twbx contains all
of the unnecessary information to build
a visualization so it's called a
packaged workbook and it compresses it
all together however the twb just
contains instructions about how to
interact with the data source so when
it's building a visualization Tableau
we'll look at the data source and then
build the visualization with an extract
it contains all of the information that
you need so all the data is wrapped up
inside of there and there's no
connection that has to be made between
Tableau and the data source because it's
all right inside whereas with the twb it
has to connect to the data service or
else it doesn't have the data to build
the visualizations it just knows it has
the instructions of what to do with that
data so the biggest difference is twbx
has the data inside of it whereas at twb
only has the instructions question 15
explain the difference between Tableau
worksheet dashboard story and workbook
perfect here's a breakdown and
explanation of each of those and in
Tableau this entire thing that we've
been looking at all these sheets is a
workbook however this sheet 7 is just
one worksheet all of them together is a
workbook and Sheet 7 is a worksheet the
big difference between worksheet and a
dashboard is that the worksheet is just
one visualization and so it is only one
set of columns and rows here and a
dashboard could contain multiple
visualizations so if we wanted to see
our heat map and our tree map on the
same page that would be a dashboard and
then a story is somewhat similar to a
presentation mode and so you can have
different pages and so we could say here
is our heat map and then we could make
another page and look at our
tree map
and then look at our heat map
and then we can duplicate that page and
we could say let's focus on furniture
so we're going to highlight furniture
and then so if we were to go through
these one at a time
we would say here's your tree map and
then we would look at information there
and we would say here's our heat map and
then the next screen we'll say let's
focus on furniture and you can see that
it highlighted furniture for me when I
went to the next seat so a story can
show you things one at a time it's like
a presentation mode so the differences
are the workbook contains the sheets and
the dashboards are the stories the
worksheet is a single view dashboard is
multiple views and a story is a sequence
a sequence is a good keyword to remember
when you're describing a story and did
you know that the only place that you
can access the dimensions and the
measures and custom Fields we've made is
on a worksheet so when you're looking at
a dashboard
so on a worksheet we see dimensions and
measures when you're looking at a
dashboard you no longer see dimensions
and measures what you do see are all of
the worksheets similarly when you look
at a story you no longer see on any
dimensions and measures but you do see
all the worksheets and the dashboards
question 16 what do you understand by
Blended access with a blended axis you
could use two measures that share an
axis and that means they necessarily
have the same scale so let's build
something with a blended axis
so we can make a visualization that
looks at
sales over time we'll bring on order
date
and
let's just do order date by
there we go so we can see sale
say we wanted to
also see profit this is two
visualizations that have two different
axes but if we wanted them to have the
same axes and just the same marks card
you see how I made two different marks
cards we could bring on measure values
and take off all the measures that we
don't want
we just want
when we take them off here it's creating
this filter here for measure names
and let's take off these two extra
visualizations and now we have a
visualization that has a blended axis
for sales over time and profit over time
see that they necessarily have the same
axes there is no second axes what is the
use of a dual axis and how do you create
one perfect so dual access allows you to
compare measures and you can have two
different scales so if we had this same
visualization to that same information
that we wanted to see with again profit
and sales
over time
we'll do okay okay great and we wanted
them to have the same axes we could
right click on the second pill of the
measures and click dual axis and now you
can see that they do not
share the same access and you can see
profit is much higher here right there
and so the use of this would be
sometimes you need things to have
different axes if you come here and you
click synchronize axes you end up
getting a pretty similar visualization
but you do get two separate marks cards
so a key thing to bring up if you are
asked the difference between a blended
axis and a dual axis chart is one that
the Blended axis uses the same scale and
the Dual axis could have two different
scales and two a dual axis has two marks
cards so let's say we wanted our profit
to not be a line chart but to be a bar
chart that gives you that option when
you go to the Blended axis we only have
one marks card so we change it to Bar
everything is bar
but back over here we change it to
circles and we see the circles
so if we wanted to show sales by year
and profit ratio by year in the same
view that's where two different scales
could be handy let's build that
visualization so we'll make a new chart
and we'll bring on sales
and profit ratio
over time
that is profit I still did profit so
I'll drag profit ratio right over top of
profit there we go and you can see that
they can't use the same scale because
this is a percentage and so if we had
them on a blended axis twenty percent is
really 0.2 and it would just be so tiny
but if we wanted them on the same area
to add to apply to the same space here
with a dual axis it that you can still
see useful information there but
otherwise this would just be in such a
tiny tiny space so our profit ratio
would just show up right here almost
like a straight line
question 18 what will the following
function return left three comma Tableau
here's the question again and here are
the potential answers tab or Eau error
or none of the above so just take a
moment and see if you can answer this
question correctly go ahead and pause
the video and if you get the answer you
can comment below and then we will
discuss we've taken some time to answer
this question and let's go ahead and see
what the answer is the answer is it will
return an error that's because the
Syntax for our left is that the string
must go first first you say left then
you put the string and then you put the
number so let's talk about what left
does it returns a specific number of
characters from the left and if you had
done it correctly the left is this side
so if you had done the string first and
you said you want three the result would
be t a b there's also one called write
and that would come from the other end
and go Eau so that's where these answers
came from question 19 how do you handle
null and other special values Tableau is
unable to plot null values or zeros or
negative values on a logarithmic axis
and so it will display an indicator in
the lower right corner which looks like
this telling you that is unable to draw
those two points so when you click on
the indicator you can choose from the
following first you can choose to filter
the data which will exclude the null
values from the visualization or you can
click show data at the default position
so we'll look at both of these
so you click on your indicator and it
will say what do you want to do with
these two values if we click filter the
data then you can see that it has
filtered those that blank space and
drawn a line connecting
those dates in between even though there
is no point for the 29th or the 30th it
goes straight from the 28th to the 31st
so what's happening on eye visualization
is it's adding this filter if we press
the back button we see that filter
disappears if we come down and select
filter the data it adds a filter here
that then
only includes non-mill values
so those are all removed from our
visualization and up to this point you
can see that we have one point per day
the 21st the 22nd the 23rd 24th but then
when we get to the 28th we don't have a
29th or 30th and it just draws that line
to the 31st
assuming
that during that time period what we
want is a straight line now the other
option would be we could also make the
assumption that whenever there is a null
value that actually means zero sales
have happened during that time so that's
when you would click show data at
default position
and now it draws those two points at the
zero line
and when you hover it still shows sales
null
so and when you hover here you can see
the actual amount for sales during that
time
so if a null in your data means zero
then show a default position is good for
you and if it doesn't necessarily mean
zero
then you can
filter the data or you can leave it
disconnected like this question 20 find
the top product subcategories by sales
within each delivery method which
subcategory is ranked number two for
first class ship mode if you'd like to
pause the video and work on this on your
own and then see if what you did matches
what we did then you're welcome to now
at this time and comment below what your
answer is
okay
so we want to know by subcategory
and by ship mode which subcategory ranks
the highest for each ship mode so in
sales so if we take sales onto the
visualization we can see that by the
ship mode it's already split up and we
could see that maybe this one for
standard class it would be chairs you
can kind of look through and kind of oh
it's not chairs chairs isn't number one
because we have this one it's phones so
to make it easier we're going to change
some of sales to a rank table
calculation so we're going to come here
and click add table calculation
and we're going to change the
calculation type to rank and it's going
to rank them
in order of sales
so but we right now we can see that it's
highlighting that's called calculation
assistance helping us understand
how it's ranking US so if I and select
calculation assistance then it gets rid
of it but you can see right now it's
ranking it across the table so it says
accessories has most sales in standard
class then second class then first class
then same date
and that's not what we want to see we
want to see it up and down we want to
see for first class which subcategory
has the highest sales second highest
sales so let's turn back on our
calculation assistance and we're going
to click table down
and you can see now it's going up and
down within first class what are all the
subcategories ranked so that's what we
want now as soon as you click things in
the table calculation it applies it over
here so you don't have an OK button so
you can just close that out and you can
see now we have a rank up and down
for the subcategory so back to the
question was which subcategory is ranked
second for first class ship mode here's
first class let's find number two it's
chairs
question number 21 find the customer
with the lowest overall profit what is
his slash her profit ratio let's go
ahead and build this visualization
customer profit
and we're going to
bring all of our customers on
and then we're going to bring on profit
let's do it as a visualization so I'll
bring it on to columns and then let's
sort smallest to biggest so Cindy
Stewart
is the one who has our lowest profit
and now to figure out her profit ratio
we need to make a calculated field which
I've already made here
so in this calculated field we take the
sum of profit and divide it by the sum
of sales we do this so that it will sum
up all of the profit per row so for
Cindy we want to take all of her profit
over all of her transactions and divided
by all of her sales instead of doing it
row by row profit divided by sales
profit divided by sales and then summing
that up at the end so we'll take our
profit ratio and put it on the label and
we can see what her profit ratio is and
since it's a ratio here I have it in a
percent
if you don't have your profit ratio set
up as a percent it will look like this
negative 1.65 question number 22 what is
the rank function in Tableau we gotta
look at the rank function earlier when
we figured out our top product
subcategories by sales and what was
ranked number two so I'm sure you're
familiar with what ranking is which is
assigning something a position like
first place or second place usually
within a category and usually based on a
measure so Tableau is able to rank in
several different ways where you can do
rank or rank dense rank modified or rank
unique and we'll take a look at these in
a visualization here and talk about the
difference but if you are asked about
the rank function in Tableau it's worth
bringing up that there are several
different ways to rank and going into a
little bit of detail on those different
ways will be helpful for you so so let's
build off of this rank example instead
so we're going to bring on our store and
we've got store A B C D and E
and then we'll bring on our sales
and store a had ten dollars and he had
forty dollars
so
now let's create a calculated field
we're going to call it rank
we're going to do a rank calculated
field based on sales
we're going to do a rank calculated
field based on some of sales
perfect
okay
we'll double click on Rank and we can
see first place is the one who had the
most sales and fifth place is the one
with the least sales now we had a tie
here at 20 and it gave them both third
place and then it skipped fourth place
and went to fifth place and that's how
the basic rank function works so if we
duplicate it
and we edit our copy
and we're gonna make this one
rank dents
you know what let's do rank modified
second
and we bring on rank modified
let's have this happen in order so sum
of sales then rank then rank modified
now you can see it's similar to rank for
second but then it skips third and goes
to Fourth and then fifth so over here it
gave them higher number when there was a
tie and over here it gave them the lower
number when there was a tie
so if you could remember that rank gives
them the higher number and rank modified
gives them the lower number that will be
helpful
for your interview
now we're going to take a look at rank
dents
rank dense apply
and rank dense doesn't skip a number so
it goes one two three four and it
condenses the ranking
without any skipping any numbers and now
let's
do our last one
which is going to be
rank unique
okay
and with rank unique it refuses to give
two the same Rank and how it determines
when there is a tie is it will look at
the dimension that's in the
visualization and do whichever one comes
first in ASCII so it goes one two and
these are a tie and since capital B
comes before
lowercase C
then it's doing B first then C then a
so in your interview it will be really
impressive to talk about the different
versions of ranks and how they all work
question 23 how can you embed a web page
in a dashboard so we're just going to
build this and then explain it so I have
here my map by sales and we're going to
build a dashboard
we'll bring on first we'll change our
layout so I can fill up the screen then
let's bring on my map
and I've added the state name and the
sales on the map here
for
an embedded web page you can grab it
from the objects section the web page
and then you could put a URL right
inside of here and then that will embed
that page underneath
so if we wanted to do Wikipedia or
something we can hit OK and it will take
you to Wikipedia
but what we're going to do is make this
page Dynamic based on what state you
select it'll look up that Wikipedia page
for that state so you could maybe look
at some population data we'll close that
and we'll try again we're going to bring
on our web page it's going to ask for a
URL but we're just going to hit OK and
not provide it with a URL and then we'll
use this dashboard action
and create a URL action
that then contains our URL with our
state appended at the end which is how
Wikipedia formats their URL so we'll hit
ok oh I forgot one more thing let's do
it on select instead of on menu so
whenever we select something it will run
this okay okay and now when we select
Texas
it brings up the Texas Wikipedia page
when we select Nebraska it'll change
so the major points to know on how to
embed a web page is you bring it in from
the objects section and then if they ask
how to make it Dynamic you use dashboard
actions and a URL action
question 24 design A View to show
region-wide profit and sales
so one way you could do this is by
bringing on region and then bringing on
profit and sales
and that's a pretty simple view of
profit and sales by region however one
thing that interviewers may be looking
for when asking a question about region
is your mapping capabilities in Tableau
so what we could do is region is not a
geographic location so it takes a little
bit of creativity but if you bring on
state by double clicking it and it Maps
out the states
you can
make it a map here and it fills it in
and then you can bring region onto color
and that splits It Up by region
and then if you bring on profit
and sales on the labels
and let's also bring on the state onto
labels
and then you can look at your profit and
sales inside of their regions inside of
their states
and so um that is another view where you
could look at profit and sales by region
and it's a little bit more takes
advantage of some of the mapping
capabilities in Tableau it may be what
your interviewer is looking for so you
could discuss multiple ways to look at
it but here is one way that we could
recommend it question 25 how can you
optimize the performance of a dashboard
there are multiple ways to optimize the
performance dashboard some of the things
that you might mention is that you could
exclude any Fields you're not using from
your visualization just keep them off or
you can use extract filters and if you
recall extract filters will remove out
rows of data from the extract and so
only focus on the data that you need
another thing you can do is try and
limit the amount of filters that you use
and when you do use filters avoid using
quick filters and you can use action
filters and parameter filters instead
filters cause your queries in the
database to be a little bit more complex
and can keep them from running as
efficiently as they could use Min and
Max instead of average because average
functions require more processing time
than Minimax also you can try to use
Boolean and numerical calculations
because computers do better with
integers and booleans than they do with
strings so quick things to remember is
keep your data simple use fewer filters
and when you do use filters use Brown
your actions avoid using average use Min
and Max and avoid using strings by using
booleans and numerical calculations
question 26 which visualization will be
used in the given scenarios here we have
three scenarios of opportunities that
you might want to visualize and there is
no perfectly exact answer for these but
there are some visualizations that tend
better for certain types of data however
there sometimes could be different ways
to visualize it and it doesn't mean that
these are the very best ways however if
you want to take a moment go ahead and
pause the video and go through and
figure out what your three answers are
and comment below and we can discuss
what we think the best ways are so first
we want to show aggregated sales totals
across a range of product categories and
subcategories we want to show the
duration of events or activities and we
want to show quarter wise profit growth
so to show aggregated sales totals
across a range of products subcategories
and categories you could use a tree map
the reason we bring up a tree map here
is that they are known for allowing you
to show a visualization using hierarchy
so let's take a look at that we're going
to show aggregated sales totals across
the range of product categories and
subcategories so if we come here and
make a sheet
and we want to see sales across control
click
category and subcategory and then we
click a tree map what happens it's
showing it based on size and color and
so it shows the size the bigger the size
the more sales and the darker the color
the more sales and the reason we choose
a tree map over just a normal heat map
is that it makes a category here so we
can compare this box that has all the
technology in it see how all these are
technology to this box that has all of
the office supplies and you can quickly
see the technology
has more than office supplies but you
can also see that phones has more than
art and it breaks it up as a hierarchy
and breaks it up based on your sum of
sales and question two is show duration
or events a duration of events or
activities and you would use a Gantt
chart gun charts are used to show
duration
and each of these lines is a duration so
it's like it's got a start date and end
date basically and it shows you how long
everything takes and the last one is to
show profit growth and you can use a
waterfall chart and that looks like
this where you can see how the profit
changes across every period And if it's
going up or down and each one of these
show you how much up or how much down
they go but as we said there are
potentially other answers to this
question so if you have any questions
about why we didn't say this chart or
that chart go ahead and comment below
and we can start a discussion question
27 what would you do if some countries
or provinces or any geographical entity
is missing and displaying a null when
you use map view so when you start to
map the geographical fields that you
have sometimes Tableau is unable to map
them because their locations are unknown
or ambiguous meaning a lot of states
have a city called Springfield and I
won't know where to draw that City so
for example let's look at here so we've
taken city as our detail and it's drawn
a lot of cities however it's got a lot
of unknown values here so if this
question comes stuff you've got to
remember these three things you can edit
locations filter the data or show data
default position edit locations allows
you to correct the locations by putting
in their unique names I'll show you an
example of this filter the data means
just keep them off of The View and show
data default position means show it at
zero zero on the map
so edit locations here we can say here's
all of these cities that seem to exist
in multiple locations and we could say
well we know what state they're in as
well and that should help you answer the
question so you can choose a field that
will Define the state so here we're
saying the state is from the State field
and we hit OK
and then they can draw the rest of those
cities
sometimes you want to keep them off
perhaps maybe they spelled city names
wrong and you just want to exclude those
and the last one is show data default
position
which is zero zero 28 what is a level of
detail expression
a level of detail expression or an LOD
expression is maybe the lay level
presented to you and LOD stands for
level of detail so obviously it helps
you get to the level of detail that you
want in your visualization but it also
is used to run complex queries at the
data source level instead of all in the
Tableau interface
so we're going to take a look at an
example here which is adding a dimension
to an already calculated aggregate field
in our case we're going to exclude a
dimension from a calculator
so here we have a visualization that I
built and right now it's just looking at
sales by category and subcategory but
say we wanted to look at the total sales
for furniture
and not break it up by the subcategory
so if we take off subcategory then we
get the total sales for furniture but if
we want a side by side and so that you
could see the total sales for furniture
and you can see it broke it up by
subcategory you can use a level of
detail calculation this I already made
the field for it I've called it exclude
subcategory so that's right here right
now it just contains sales but we're
going to use the level of detail
calculation exclude
and we're going to tell it what to
exclude which is subcategory and then
we're going to do sum
of sales so that it will sum it up for
us
and once I apply these changes it should
change it here and our labels
perfect so now we can see that it's
ignoring the fact that this is chairs
and this is tables this is bookcases
it's just doing the total for furniture
and just ignoring these because we told
it to exclude so level of detail helps
you to be able to define the level that
you want to in your visualization
regardless of what else exists on your
visualization
it also moves some of the logic from
inside of Tableau to the actual database
and there are three level of detail
calculations this will be an important
thing to bring up in the interviews they
might give you brownie points when you
can remember all three of the level of
detail calculations which are
we looked at exclude
but we have exclude
include and fix
so include exclude are pretty easy to
remember and just always remember fixed
as well question 29 how do you calculate
daily profit measure using level of
detail here's another opportunity for
you to pause the video and take a look
at calculating a daily profit measure
using level of detail we are going to
get started
profitable level of details so we want
to have a daily profit measure and I
already made a place for it profit per
day
and we want to look at the profit for a
day regardless of what else is on the
visualization so we're going to use a
fixed
instead of an include or an exclude
which will only take into account
whatever you put in for include or
exclude fixed we'll take into account
everything it will ignore everything
else on the visualization and only look
at what's in your list here so we're
going to fix it by day
and you have to put a colon and we're
going to do a sum of profit for each of
those dates
close it off so now we have our profit
per day and we'll hit OK and now we're
going to make a kpi
which for our purposes if profit for a
day is greater than 2 000 then that day
is highly profitable if it's less than
zero then it's unprofitable otherwise it
is profitable so we're going to go if
our profit per day
is greater than two thousand
then
we're going to call it highly profitable
else if
we're going to do less than or equal to
zero
else
otherwise it is profitable
always have to end with an end
great
okay so now we're going to make
some visualizations and it's going to
look at it by year
now it all fits in one view we um can
rotate these labels to make it easier to
see and we're going to bring on
order ID
but now it's showing like a lot of
orders and so we actually want it to be
used as a measure and we're going to do
a count state
great so now we can see how many orders
were on each day and so that's helpful
for us to see how many orders are on
this day each day but we want to see
the orders on each day that are highly
profitable versus unprofitable versus
just profitable so we're going to use
our level of detail
and break it up in a different section
so we have highly profitable profitable
and unprofitable let's also bring this
on to our color
highly profitable profitable and
profitable and now we can see that the
profitable ones are going up
unprofitable ones seem to be going down
in 2015 and that's nice but they are
going up and highly profitable is not
very many oh in this case we did area
charts instead of just line charts to
make that change you change it from
automatic to area and that helps you see
some of that
spatially as well comment below if you
were able to make this visualization on
your own question 30 how can you
schedule a workbook in Tableau after
publishing it so when you publish a
workbook in Tableau if you've used an
extract you're going to need to refresh
that extract so in Tableau when you
create a Tableau Data source and it's an
extract version of the data source it
will no longer update if the data from
your database updates so somebody's made
some changes to your database or your
Excel file and you want to see that in
your Tableau visualization well you're
not going to see it but you can see it
if you make a refresh so you do that on
Tableau server and you can remember that
you have to get all the way to your data
source so you can go to your data
sources or to your workbooks and then
you look at the data source on your
workbook and you go actions extract
refresh and then you select schedule a
refresh so that looks like this you can
press these three dots next to it and
click refresh extracts or you can go to
actions and then here you click schedule
a refresh instead of refresh now and
then oftentimes in Tableau you'll have
several different options you can choose
daily at 7am or every 4 hours if an
interviewer is asking you about how to
schedule a refresh it might be
worthwhile bringing up the fact that you
only need to schedule a refresh if you
are using an extract on your data source

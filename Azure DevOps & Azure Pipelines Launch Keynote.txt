welcome to the launch of Azure DevOps my
name is Jamie cool I'm the director of
program management for the Azure DevOps
team we got a ton of exciting things to
talk about today here with me I have mr.
DevOps himself Donovan Brown thanks for
having me Jamie I'm really excited to
get started because some of the demos
we're gonna show today I'm really gonna
highlight the power that we have with a
chanela what I want to make sure people
realize is that you can also be a part
of this conversation it's not just the
two of us but if you're out there on
social media make sure that you use the
hashtag as your DevOps
and if you want to learn more about what
we think about DevOps here at Microsoft
make sure that you go to a sure com
forward slash demo right now we're gonna
be talking about DevOps you know for
this next hour I think it'd be important
for us to level set well we actually
mean when we said DevOps and I've been
led to believe that you might have a few
opinions on this particular topic a few
and it's really important to level set
because if you ask several different
people what DevOps means you're gonna
get several different answers so it's
really good to make sure that we level
said on what we believe DevOps is here
at Microsoft and we believe that it's
the union of people process and products
to enable continuous delivery of value
to our end-users the most important word
of that definition is value too many
people focus on just moving files or
automation but it's the value that
you're trying to deliver to your
end-users and what I've found is that it
takes the products to support the
process what your people have chosen
that's empowers your people to deliver
that continuous value what I think is
even more important than that is that
when you start to take that digital
transformation when you're on this
journey the gains that you get are
staggering and sometimes almost
unbelievable as I go and I visit our
customers all over the world those that
have started this transformation are
deploying sometimes like 47 times more
frequently than they were before and
historically there used to be fail fast
but they're not failing fast they're
succeeding fast because they have seven
times less failure eight yeah you know
when I hear some of those numbers on the
surface they just seem kind of
staggering and crazy when I step back
and I think about it I realized you know
what like I've experienced that you know
firsthand you know it wasn't that long
ago that a Microsoft you know the
average chip cycle was two years
sometimes longer you know now I look at
just last week last week we shipped
hundreds of changes just as your DevOps
itself
you do the math between a couple you
know a couple years and hundreds of
changes a week you get these big numbers
and it's not like the folks today are
just that much better than the folks ten
years ago it's that we've gotten smarter
we've learned we have better processes
we have better products and that's a lot
of what we're going to talk about today
and what I'm excited about because we're
now providing the products that we use
that we've invested in and bringing them
to you so you're going to be able to
take advantage of them and that's what
as your DevOps is as your DevOps are a
set of services that span the entire
DevOps lifecycle you can use them all
together for a full solution or if you
just need a one with a particular
problem you can use just that or you can
put it together with other tools that
you're already using that you want
regardless of how you use it it's going
to provide a lot of value for it for you
and I know that because inside of
Microsoft we get that value we see that
regularly just in the last month over
80,000 folks here at Microsoft have used
a shred of ops to deliver our products
to you from both the smallest all the
way up to some of the largest so let's
start by drilling in and what we
actually mean by ours our DevOps and
let's start with Azure pipelines so
Azure pipelines is really the heart of
the DevOps process it's a CI CD system
it's a continuous integration and
deployment system and you use this to
keep the quality of your application up
to make sure every change that you make
is taking you forward instead of
backwards and that's really the key
thing if you want to be able to ship
whenever you want to keep your code
quality high you can also use it as a
launchpad to get your code up into the
cloud whether it's our cloud Google AWS
or any other because as your pipelines
is a system that works for any language
any platform and any cloud we have
hosted pools and machines of Linux
Windows and Mac that we manage for you
so that you don't have to because
everything we're trying to do with this
is to make your life easier as a
developer and as your pipelines doesn't
stop with what we've shipped it's highly
extensible we have an ecosystem of over
500 extensions that have been
contributed for both the community and
from our partners from slack to Soner
cloud all right you know one of the
things that always excites me the most
is when I see a new extension showing up
and seeing what someone's been able to
to do and extend you know with
are with our product now you can use it
for any type of application in any type
of deployment mechanism but containers
are increasingly becoming that unit of
application deployment so as your
pipelines works great with containers
you can use it to build your containers
to test and validate your container to
publish it to whatever register you want
and deploy it to whatever service you
want including kubernetes now it's a lot
more interesting to actually look at it
then talk about it
so Donovan can you give us a walkthrough
of Azure pipelines so Azure pipelines is
the CI CD system that we have that can
build any language targeting any
platform and that's what excites me
about it as Jamie said earlier we give
you access to max to Windows machines
and to Linux machines there's nothing to
install you just give us code and we'll
build it for you Here I am on my
dashboard and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to click on this icon for this
particular spring MVC application this
is a Java app over here I happen to have
a no js' application again any language
in any platform clicking on this icon is
then going to take me to my build
results of some of the bills that I've
been running previously if we look over
here I can see exactly what branch I was
building I can see if I was actually
working on a pull request or not and
clicking on one of these builds is now
gonna take me to a summary page and a
log that I can quickly review as we can
see here I had an error on this
particular build if I go ahead and drill
in on here I can see this log file I can
see this great map on the right-hand
side and if I scroll down to this huge
palm file build you'll see that we
actually had some errors down here so
it's very easy for me to diagnose but
this isn't the only way that I can see
my test results and I'll show you some
other cool ways of doing that here in
just a moment another thing that we can
do is we can use this histogram at the
top and start to see other builds that
have already run and luckily we've had
some of whom that have succeeded and as
you can see here I have the same log but
better than that I also have this great
summary the summary here allows me to
see my test results it allows me to see
any associated work I can come down here
and also see any deployments that may be
running a matter of fact you've already
successfully deployed this build into
our dev environment and it's pending my
approval to go all the way into our QA
environment you get to see the real
power of our pipeline system when you go
back in and you start to look at editing
one of these it's a really nice
graphical user interface that allows you
to simply drag and drop town
again I want to highlight over here if
you look at this drop down here you can
see all the different hosted pools that
we give you what I mean by hosted is
there's nothing for you to install all
these resources are provided for you and
they come in a variety of different
platforms you need to build your iOS
application we have a Mac sitting in the
cloud ready to build that for you you
want to build your containers on Linux
we have multiple Linux images and
containers running for you
so you can go and build those images and
once they're build you can deploy it in
the docker hub or to ACR wherever your
images need to be stored in addition to
that where can you get your code you can
get your code from the most popular
source control systems your doing open
source work and you want to put your
code in github no problem you want to
have private repositories because you
want to secure your code and you don't
want anyone else to see it you can use
our get support as well you already have
your code in subversion or some other
form of source control don't worry about
it you can still use as your pipelines
to get your code wherever it exists
today and be able to start running CI
and CD against it again adding new tasks
is very simple you simply click on this
plus here and you can simply drag and
drop from hundreds of tasks that we have
available for you right out of the box
what I really like about the
out-of-the-box tasks is that they're all
open source you can go and see exactly
how we wrote all of these hundreds of
tasks and use this as a way for you to
learn how to write your own if you
already know nodejs or PowerShell you
know how to write these particular tasks
but before you go off and write your own
adriaen courage you to go and look at
our marketplace as jamie said earlier
hundreds of our partners have gone off
and written extensions that add a lot of
value and all you have to do is simply
click on it you get them for free and
add them to your pipeline and you know
you have new value not only in your
building your release but new hubs and
widgets and all other cool places that
you can extend our system now I love our
graphical user interface but I've known
a lot of people prefer to use yamo they
want everything in source control now
what's really nice about this is you can
just simply click on this link here and
we will export the handle for you so you
don't even have to write it what I
really like about this is I actually
keep both of these up because I want the
best of both worlds I love the visual
representation I love the ease of
editing I can come in for example make a
quick change to a particular task and
then export just the Amal
for that task I can copy this to my
clipboard I'll run over here to get hub
where my code is currently sitting I can
find that Yemma file that I created
earlier and I could edit it right here
inside of github so let's just go ahead
make a quick edit I'm gonna paste the
code I did I just want you to see that
we can have a really cool pull request
let's make some changes I'm gonna come
down here and save this into a different
branch because I want to show you some
cool stuff here so I'm creating a patch
branch for the change to my llamo file
and when I do this and create this pull
request I've wired up Azure DevOps to my
github repository sets that every pour
request that is submitted
will actually have to run that build and
succeed before I'm even notified as we
can see down here we now have a bill
that is queued it's currently in
progress now if I go ahead and click on
the details I will be able to jump right
back inside of Azure DevOps see the
pipeline that it actually started
running for me and in a moment here once
it connects to the agent I'll be able to
see a full live log of everything
running against my particular build that
way I can get quick verification that if
the pull request is good that it passed
my test and doesn't need the attention
of the moderators and the contributors
to go back in and review that particular
pull request another thing that I wanted
to talk to you about was the testing
that I mentioned earlier so if we to go
back to that definition let's pick this
one here for some fun and I'm gonna
click on analytics what analytics does
for me is it actually watches the test
results over the history of this
particular build and it gives me a
report letting me know how successful
our testing has been over the course of
a period of time if I click on this I
get to drill down into these analytics
and I actually identify the tests that
we need to go back in and verify there's
different ways that I can slice and dice
this data find out which of my tests are
taking too long so that we can focus to
get our build times down I can figure
out which tests are flaky
for example the about test was the one
that was broken and then and spend some
time going in and investing to make sure
that is safe once I know I have a high
quality output from my build the next
thing we have to do is release that code
and that's where our release product or
what we call pipelines as you'll see in
the navigation here is where we take the
output of the build and we run it
through a pipeline deploying it into
multiple environments and even allowing
you to do approvals between those
environments to make sure that your code
has
safely landed in the target environment
if I were to go back in for example and
look at one of these releases we'll be
able to see that I'm actually deploying
this application into kubernetes if you
wanted to use helm you could I'm a
newbie when it comes to using containers
in kubernetes so I just went ahead and
do some coop cuddle commands to get my
code into the cluster and as you can see
here I did a coop cutter will apply and
another coop cuddle set and then I was
able to deploy my code if I go back in
here really quick and edit it well
you'll be able to see here is that if I
go and look at my tasks I can see
exactly what it was that was doing
before I was playing with infrastructure
as code so I was actually able to take
an arm template and deploy my entire
kubernetes cluster into Azure before it
even existed which is really nice as
well I could come in here make some
really quick edits the tasks are so well
written that even your pool secret is
automatically handled for you again
allowing you to take your code from the
fingertips of your developers and
putting it into your hands of the users
using Azure pipelines so that just shows
you some of the power that we have
inside of Azure pipelines for any
language in any platform all right Jaime
show us some more stuff thanks Donovan
so over the last six years or so we've
been on a journey here in Microsoft that
we often talk about internally as the
new Microsoft and it really starts at
the top but at this point it's
percolated really all throughout the
entire company and it's someone that's
been here for 20 years this has been a
really exciting time to be part of
Microsoft you know a big part of what it
means to be the new Microsoft has been
the embrace of open-source and if you
look over the last six years you know
the amount of things that we've been
doing in this space continues to grow up
go up year after year after year you
know it starts with things like simply
making sure that we're embracing the
projects that the community has chosen
to embrace a great example of this would
be kubernetes on Azure another example
that I was directly involved with seven
years ago was get right it seems obvious
now but back then it wasn't such an
obvious question about whether we should
embrace git or whether we should try to
compete with it we chose to embrace it
and now seven years later almost all of
the development that happens at
Microsoft happens in gets
including windows and just step back and
think about that for a minute the
windows team uses the source control
system that line is built to build
windows it really is a very new
Microsoft another example is open
sourcing more and more of the products
that we deliver vs code and typescript
are great examples as your pipelines
itself has core parts of its
infrastructure open sourced so I'm
excited today because we're gonna a
bolide amiss list and that is free CI CD
with Azure pipelines for any open source
project that wants it this means any
open source project can use Azure
pipelines
you get unlimited minutes up to 10
concurrent jobs running at the same time
access to our Linux Mac and Windows pool
we use the same exact infrastructure for
open source that we use internally for
our own builds and that we use for our
customers this means open source gets
the same quality of service that we can
that we give to everyone we also want it
to be really easy for projects to get
started that includes open source and
really all of them since most open
source projects live on github as your
pipelines is now part of the github
marketplace this means that you can
discover configure and even pay for
Azure pipelines through the github
marketplace so if you already have a
billing relationship with github you
don't have to set up a new one with us
and again the key theme of all of this
is just about making the lives of
developers easier and if they got one
less payment vehicle to manage your life
just got a little bit easier I'd like to
show you that in action so let's switch
over here and I'm going to show you as
your pipelines as part of the github
marketplace so I'm looking at your
pipelines I can configure my plans or I
can set up a new plan we scroll down we
can see that you could configure a free
plan and like I said it's just free for
open source we also have a free plan for
private projects you get up to eighteen
hundred three minutes if you want to use
it for private projects you can add more
parallel jobs you can run more of them
at the same time you can do that for $40
each
and again you can configure this and pay
for it right through github itself let's
go ahead and choose the free offer and
let's set this up we're going to
configure this in the Raleigh labs
github organization and now what's going
to happen is we're gonna consent to
grants as your pipelines access to the
repositories it could be all the
repositories it could be just individual
repositories in this case we're gonna
just grant access to some repositories
and then we'll go ahead and create a new
Azure DevOps organization and what this
is going to do is it's going to set me
up with everything I need to use as your
pipelines and as your DevOps so it's
going to create our organization and
then it's going to set up our first
project and land me an experience where
I can configure my first pipeline on for
whatever repo that I want to in that
github organization so let's go use the
node container repository once I select
that we'll go and analyze that
repository to see what's inside of it
and we see that there's a node app in it
so we're suggesting a whole variety of
different node templates that we have
out of the box but we also saw that
there was a docker image so our default
recommendation is to use our docker
template now Donavan mentioned config is
code we're gonna use that in this
situation and this is the definition of
my build process and it's simply saying
it's going to use our abun to pool and
then it's going to go build our dock
it's gonna build our docker image I
could go and modify this process as part
of it but I'm just gonna use the default
state and now I'm going to save it
you
and we're gonna check it into a new
branch so what this is gonna do this is
gonna create a pull request when the
github repository to add this yamo file
to that repository which will then have
configured pipelines and ensure that all
changes that go into that repository
from now on are validated then it's
going to kick off the first build to do
the validation of the actual
configuration of pipelines being added
to this repository so as that kicks off
we can jump back over to the github repo
and we can see that there's now a pull
request
and go into that pull request
see the file that we're adding is the
actual pipeline yamo file to go back to
the conversation we can see that
pipelines is in the process of actually
validating this change itself we also
support the github checks API which is a
rich experience for showing the status
of a variety of check of all of the
sources that are hooked up to this
repository so here you can see as your
pipeline's publishing that status into
it so this just gives you a taste of how
easy it is to get started and you know
the type of integration that we have
with github as part of Azure pipelines
now as part of the run-up to the launch
of Azure pipelines we've been working
with a number of open source partners to
do some more early onboarding and we've
been really enthused with both the
feedback and the reception that we've
gotten so I thought it'd be interesting
if we invited some of them to come join
us so we have folks from a number of
from a number of them the first is
github desktop so we have Bill hack from
github and he's here with Donovan to
share his learnings Donovan thanks Jamie
so again we have Phil here from github
tell me what you do it github hi I'm
Phil hack a director of engineering at
github I and in charge of the client
applications team so we're the team that
builds all the software you use outside
of github such as get a desktop atom
which is text editor
electron which is a framework for
building cross-platform apps using web
tech okay and then we also have a team
that builds extensions to third-party
editors such as a visual studio just to
do code and unity awesome so I would
imagine managing that many products
something is crucial to CI has to be
important so what is CI really mean to
you and what does it bring to your
development I think one of the best ways
to understand CI especially when it
comes to open source projects is to
imagine a world without it and how
people would collaborate with open
source so imagine you know someone named
John is right and you know approaches
github see the repo says I want to
contribute to this fixes a bug pushes
the code up and now Egret you know who's
if one of the project maintainer comes
along and she notices that oh this
person submitted this
fix let me try it out so it pulls the
code down and hits the build and it
doesn't build and I'm like oh darn it
you know so Wright's comment you know
nothing you know good fix the build and
then the next day you know John's back
let sees that you know okay fix the
build pushes it Ygritte takes it down
the next day runs a test and and
realizes oh the tests fail because you
know maybe John only random in the dev
configuration not the prod configuration
and what continuous integration brings
is it really tightens that feedback loop
so that rather than you know John having
to wait for some human to look at it he
pushes up the code all the tests run in
all the proper configurations and it
gives immediate feedback it can run your
tests your static analysis your linters
and that way like you know you take the
grunt work out and really tighten a
feedback loop and then force your
project standards and all of that and so
that's one of the beauty of CI for
open-source project yeah I remember the
days when I used to come into work do a
get latest and the build was broken and
because someone left right and then that
person has to bring Donuts the next day
and when we had CI it was really cool
because it would point the finger at the
person who told us donuts but you knew
not to go do a get latest because you
had that signal saying the build is
broken which also protected us that way
as well yeah a lot of people would try
to do the whole traffic light thing
exactly in the office right now they're
doing raspberry pies with LEDs and like
you know if it's if it's okay or not so
there's a lot of CI systems out there
we've been doing CI for a while what is
exciting you about a sure pipelines in
particular I mean the thing that most
excited me about as your pipelines when
I first heard about it is the
cross-platform nature of it with
electron apps like I mentioned before
you're targeting Windows Mac and Linux
and that it means that you often will
have three different CI providers each
of them with a different yam will file
sure and it becomes a bit of a
maintenance headache and with that your
pipelines you know we could have one
provider with one Yamma file and have it
build on all three targets absolutely I
always get on stage and I'm saying any
language any platform and people think
I'm bluffing I'm like no look at our our
queues right there any platform you need
is in there for Mac
for Linux if you're doing mobile if
you're doing containers that's amazing
and I've it was interesting I was going
around github the other day and every
time I'd go into a repository I see
three and four llamo files like I don't
understand like why are people doing
this right don't they know that they can
get one yeah mole to rule them all and
get you all the platforms well I mean
that wasn't an option not too long ago
right that's true and it's particularly
nice the other thing about Azure
pipelines is you know through your
generosity you're all are offering it to
open-source projects are free so I think
yet we have millions of open-source
projects on github I think that's a
great option for them especially for
electron projects who really want to
target all this all three platforms cool
so you show me what you did yeah so here
we have get up desktop and this is our
git git and github GUI client okay and
it's an open source project we develop
it in the open and if I scroll down here
you can see that we have badges for our
builds and this is the azure pipelines
build and then you know let's take a
look at pull requests so you know these
are submissions by the core team as well
as people outside and so let's say you
know I'm looking through here and I see
oh here's a submission from an external
contributor and the build failed let's
investigate so I click on that you know
hey thanks Damon for contributing I'm
going to scroll all the way down to the
checks API and we can see that we can
see that for there's for failing checks
and when I expand that we can see you
know each of the individual checks and I
see that you know the azure pipeline's
build is failing so I can click details
and takes me right to logs for this
build you can see that you know it's
it's building on Windows Linux and Mac
and it failed for all three platforms if
I scroll down here on the right I can
see each of the steps of the build and
how long those steps take and here I can
see oh the linting had an error and if I
click on the error I get the full log
output so it helps me see that I needed
to leave
some strange characters from somewhere
and then you know I now know how to fix
my bill and if I want to go right back
to the pull request I click there and
I'm back where we started
awesome and this allows like I said I
don't have to as a I maintain open
source projects too and this just saves
me a ton of time as you mentioned
earlier just having to allowing them
they get the feedback from the system
and not having me stop what I'm doing
clone their repo try to build their code
find out it's broken like oh my god I
was like five minutes of my life I'm
never getting back again please someone
help me do this and now or sec the build
fails I don't even look at it
all right great that's someone you get
the same notification that I do go fix
that and then when you're ready I'll
finally go ahead and take a look at it
so yeah saved me a ton of time as well
that's exactly right
awesome Phil thank you so much for
coming and showing us how you at github
or actually using Azure pipelines all
right Jamie
go ahead and take it back you know what
really excited and resonated with me
from that conversation was the notion of
being able with one product with one
pipeline with one llamó file to be able
to validate across all three operating
systems and not have to deal with
managing any of those machines itself
it's a pain point I hear again and again
and again you know so the next project
we're gonna look at is in the Python
space so Steve dower is here with
Donovan Donovan so I want to go ahead
and address the elephant in the room I
just heard Microsoft and Python what in
the world that you do here at Microsoft
that has to do with Python I so I've
been here I've been here at Microsoft
for about six or seven years now and the
entire time being working on Python
stuff Wow so a whole lot of the visual
studio integration Visual Studio code
support for Python a whole lot of the
Azure services support for Python has
kind of come through my team or out of
my team so I've been working on that few
years and I'm also a core contributor to
Python itself so I'm one of the one of
the team of volunteers distributed
around the world that work on C Python
the reference implementation awesome
design and build a language so how did
you start to use Azure pipelines when it
comes to Python so I've been using agile
pipelines internally for years now say
all of our products are built on it as
we've already heard earlier Visual
Studio has been building on it for long
time now so I had a lot of experience
you know getting pipelines up and going
with that and then I saw the
cross-platform support was cured because
early on that wasn't there and now and
now it's here and I start looking at
that I'm like oh I could be doing a
Python builds on this across all the
platforms with a single setup right and
then the open source offer comes along
it's like oh yeah let's let's get pipe
and running on this so I just kind of
went out and started doing it cool and
just just to put a bit of context on
that I've got the the Python home page
up here we can see we've got three
badges going for the Linux Mac OS and
Windows build but Python runs on so many
more platforms than that if I run over
to this is our our existing build bot
site this runs tests against all of the
configurations that Python supports on
every single commit and you'll see this
is a really really long list sure and so
you know the the value and being able to
get off all of these manually configured
manually managed configurations onto
something that's you know cross-platform
continuous integration in a single
service is like really appealing ok and
so I did that for the main platforms and
so we have all of these pull request
builds and commit builds running now for
the main platforms and that was really
just I went to the dev guide that we
have we have all the instructions for
all the platforms on how to build we
have all the instructions for the
existing continuous integration systems
and I just pulled them over into that
visual designer that you showed earlier
sure and just got them running in their
view llamó exported out check it in and
now it's in the repository and we've got
all these builds running out of the
Python repository configured as code now
what I've noticed is that we offer a lot
of hosted agents and a lot of different
platforms but we don't offer all the
platforms you just showed there so how
did you tackle the fact that you needed
to run on even different platforms than
that
yeah so so so far this is not the
hundred different configurations right
we're not at that yet but the potential
is there because as your pipeline
supports private agents so I can set up
any machine anywhere I want virtual
machine and the cloud
physical machine on my desk old
Raspberry Pi sitting under the under the
chair wherever it happens to be put the
the pipelines agent running on it so
it's dotnet core anywhere don't
gotta run I can run that thing if it's
connected to the Internet I can start
running builds on that machine from the
edge of pipeline service that's all
still going through the one thing one
pleasure I'm already doing that it's
actually the windows release build so
one of my jobs for cpython is doing the
official releases so the the python.org
downloads for Windows built by me code
signed published all of that is is one
of my jobs as a volunteer and so you
know that's a manual process right I log
into a VM and type all these commands
and and you know sit there wait for it
to finish to the publish I want to
automate that so I put all of that into
a a pipeline build which you can see
here basically my commands this is not
running on one of the hosted agents
because it's got kind of some special
requirements to it we do profile guided
optimization on on every release build
so we want you know much more powerful
machine faster CPUs to get through the
training that much quicker gotcha
just to save us some time there's also
code signing so it's every single binary
and the Python package is signed with
authentic code certificate under the
Python Software Foundation name it's
valid on every Windows machine in the
world basically that's that's a high
value we don't want I I don't want that
you know bouncing over the internet
every time I do a build that's locked
down on a private virtual machine that I
have running on Azure here's my cue or
my pool you can say it's offline at the
moment I don't even turn the machine on
if I'm not building anything that's
encrypted at rest it's encrypted while
it's running it's BitLocker the whole
way through the machine and so I just
log into the azure portal start this
machine up queue up my builds let them
run shut the Machine down and we have
like a custom secured machine that no
one else has access to no one no one's
making one of those poor requests where
they just like download all your
certificates and send them off to their
own site absolutely because we never
even run poor requests against this
machine yeah so having that private
agent there as an option to be able to
expand beyond not only the platforms
that we provide but also very unique
secure scenarios like the one that you
just described where you're able to no
there's no way anyone's getting to that
file because there's only it only exists
in one place and that one place is
encrypted to the enth degree but I can
still use that machine to run my build
which is incredible yeah and so
as far as getting cpython building
there's there's integration steps more
to do like there's a whole lot of cool
features that we're not using on
pipelines yet but the flexibility is
there the potentials there and so I'm
really excited to keep building on that
I know I'm gonna be building on more of
this this week so if people log in at
the end of the week then they're
probably gonna see changes in this
already yeah but this is for what I
understand the engine that most of this
code is actually in see that actually
drives a Python but what if you actually
want to build a Python app is I mean are
you able to do that just as easily yeah
that's yeah one of the the newer thing
that's that's showing up in pipelines
with you know this you know being
released right now is a whole lot more
Python support and we actually reached
out and got a couple of projects on
board they were very excited to do it
talks pip pip End Python developers will
be familiar with this because they're
very well known projects there but I
want to have a look at talks actually
because it's one of the the more
thorough and complete integrations that
they've done and there's some really
cool aspects to it so ok
talks is actually a tool that is used in
CI systems people it lets you specify a
configuration file with all the build
steps and run that across all of your
full matrix of target platform ok so a
Python project is normally you care
about Windows Mac Linux you care about
Python 2 7 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 there's a big
matrix of C test against talks helps you
with that it lets you write one set of
instructions if I pull up their file you
can see there's a lot of environments
that they care about and they have all
of these steps and this was already
there ok this was already there in talks
like people have this file so when they
came came on board the pipelines and
started using it they set up a build
that like they wanted to reuse that file
you guys they didn't want to go oh we
have to rewrite everything in a
completely new form so if I pop open
their most recent build which I've got
here we can see that in fact let me jump
to there there yeah more file because I
made a yellow file 3 because that's you
know they want everything in code yep
and it's not it's not even as long as
the other one there's a few steps in
here but essentially all it does if I
look at one of these examples they're
picking a version of Python we have them
there we let you choose the version you
want at the start of
thing okay then they install themselves
they install talks and then and then
they use talks to test okay but what
they have done is they've actually
inverted it so normally you'd say run
talks run everything sure and it does
all of the platform's all the
configurations in one go
they've inverted this they're actually
using our multi version so our matrix
support okay so they have the matrix
here of all the versions and then they
use talks to run each one and let us do
it in parallel gotcha
so if I jump to the build and have a
look at the logs you can see all of
these jobs down the side which is every
configuration they care about all the
operating systems different queues for
each one of these so this one ran on Mac
this one ran on Windows different
versions each of these ran in parallel
yeah
because we'll run them in parallel each
one is running talks just a single
environments you're inside it so they're
actually getting the same result as they
would have if they were running talks on
a single machine but it's all come in
parallel some of the cool stuff they've
done here is they're using these guys
you know really good at using kind of
the standard tools that exist in pythons
so they use the standard code coverage
tool that most Python projects use this
generates a cobertura file okay which we
can upload and give you the summary
right here
and so that integrates nicely with
pipelines because we understand that
file format tests they run in PI test
which connects port j-unit perfect XML
they then push that up and we get the
summary here if I jump over to the Test
section we get all the results they have
good results right now so let me clear
that filter and all of the test results
for their process sorry about the size
here that's fine here we go we can see
all of the tests that have been run and
if any of these had failed then we'd get
the information from that so all they've
really done is taken their existing
build and test tools and switched it
over they've inverted the matrix a
little bit to run on pipelines and they
they get all this really nice
integration they haven't had to rewrite
their entire system to keep using the
standard Python tools that is already
out there and they're really just
bringing over you know what
what shell command should we run at each
step and it's really nice to not have to
learn something new yet you get this
really rich first-class experience like
you showed me the code coverage and the
test results and it's
integrated into your summary it's not as
if yeah we know how to run your stuff
but we don't know how to display the
results to you but we do which is really
amazing that you can now use it again
any language any platform but you don't
sacrifice anything when you do write we
don't care we whatever you want to bring
us we're gonna build it for you and help
you deploy it so I really enjoy and I'm
really glad that you came and shared
with us how Python is actually able to
leverage as your pipelines as well so
thanks again for coming and Jamie back
to you thanks Donovan so the last
project we're gonna look at is Visual
Studio code and I have Amanda silver
here with me from the Visual Studio code
team and Amanda everywhere I go I see
people using Visual Studio code
developers really of all types have just
embraced in an amazing way you must be
thrilled
yeah I mean I joined the Visual Studio
code team about two years ago and since
its release in 2016 it's actually become
one of the most beloved code editors
that's out there in the planet and part
of the reason for that is because we
have a really rapid cadence of updates
and releases that have new features and
the way that we can support that is we
have actually a lot of community
contributors we have over 4 million
monthly users of v/s code and we
actually have one of the it's one of the
most popular open source projects out
there on github in terms of people
contributing to it we've had about
15,000 non-microsoft contributors to the
vs code project wow that must take a lot
of work to take it out many
contributions yeah it is it's actually a
lot to manage and our development team
definitely says that that one of the
most challenging things to deal with is
actually code reviews and in fact even
when we interview other developers who
are users of our tools they also say
that code reviews can be really really
painful senior developers are just
bombarded with requests for reviews and
when they actually go in to do a review
it's really hard to figure out kind of
where to focus and even further you're
oftentimes using a web editor or
something that's kind of not your usual
tool set so we've been working with the
github team over the last couple of
months to see if we could address some
of these problems and actually we've
just released a new version of es code
that
some new API is in it and the github
team just released a new extension for
PRS that allows us to kind of have a PR
experience directly NBS code so that
should make it a lot easier awesome one
out sure okay so what you can see here
is I have my vs code at code editor
right here and you can see that I have
all the colors that I expect all the
theming that I'd like to see I have the
get like it lens extension here which is
a super popular community contributed
extension to the vs code community but I
might have a pull request to do and so
if you go to the source view right here
we can go right here and look at the in
addition to kind of seeing the usual
changes viewlet i now have a new viewlet
in here called github color pull
requests and i can further just go ahead
and expand that and see that there are
some new pull requests that are waiting
for my review so what I can do here is
expand that as well and even look at the
description now right in the context of
of BS code now what I probably want to
do is then actually go look at the code
changes so I can come in here and I can
see a dip few right here in vs code
which is pretty awesome and that allows
me to do that kind of you know first
glance a review that I might want to do
looking at the two deaths and but I get
the the color the colors and theming
that I'm used to you for the you know
typescript code that I'm looking at in
this case if I want to do a deeper
review though what I can do is go back
to the pull request here and go ahead
and check that out and what that's going
to do is it's actually going to switch
vs code into a code review mode and
bring all of those changes locally so
now I can go ahead and look at the
changes in that pull request go to the
files look at that same file and I'm
going to just expand this so that in the
full kind of view I actually get all of
those same extensions completely running
in this in this code editor right here
and so what you can see here is that I
actually get a squiggle and the reason I
get that squiggle is that because all of
the extensions are running on my local
copy of the power of the changes
the typescript compiler is actually
checking statically analyzing the code
here so if I mouse over this you know we
can see that we can see that this
variable is declared but its value is
never read so what I can do is then just
go ahead into the gutter here and just
add plus and make a comment looks like
this isn't used and go ahead and add
that comment and then the other thing
that looks really weird to me is that
these hard-coded values so again I'm
going to just add another comment here
and say hard-coded values and go ahead
and add that comment and then I can go
back to the description page for this
pull request and just go ahead and add a
top-level comment left a few notes so
add that comment and now what I can do
is actually go ahead and look at this
change directly in github and what you
can see is that the comments that I
added are still there just right here
hard-coded values looks like this isn't
used you know immediately what I what I
just showed is now in github now even
further if I go back to vs code what I
can then do is go ahead and just exit
review mode because I'm done with this
review and just go ahead and exit it and
just go back to my normal coding go back
to my normal view but now what I want to
do is go ahead and look at that look at
that pull request one more time just to
make sure that you know the build past
and that's really where as your DevOps
pipelines come in so if I look down here
what you can see is I can go directly to
the vs code build and this will bring me
directly into the azure devops pipeline
experience and what you can see here is
that we for the vs code project we
really have as your DevOps pipelines and
the reason is because it allows us to
build for Windows Linux and Mac OS all
simultaneously using all the same kind
of infrastructure all the same scripts
and so what we can see is that we have
all of those builds and
all unfortunately failed so let's just
go ahead and look at one of these
compiled sources and what you can see
down here is that yeah so we also have
the zoom level default is declared but
its value has never reached so you know
well that error would have been picked
up in the CI which add your DevOps
pipelines really would help with as well
you know now because I could run that as
part of my review it it might not even
get to that level I might actually be
able to to say hey you know before you
actually merge this you probably should
fix this error this looks really cool I
can see how a lot of folks are gonna get
a lot of benefit out of doing this and
it's going to make their their review
process and just a lot of what they do
every day a lot simpler and I'm happy to
hear that as your pipelines is able to
make the actual development of vs code
simpler in and of itself yeah we really
appreciate it and definitely our
development team I think is going to you
know feel super powered by having as
your pipelines behind them
if other folks want to try out the the
github pull requests review extension
it's actually available with the latest
vs code and in our extension gallery so
they just need to search for github pull
request awesome thanks a lot Amanda cool
thanks Jamie so we've talked a lot about
open source projects and you know the
thing about Azra devops is that it works
great for open source but really for all
types of applications from both the
smallest to the largest we have
organizations of all shapes and sizes
using it today shell is an example of a
large organization they have over 2,800
developers using average or DevOps all
over the world Hawaiian Airlines when
they moved to Azure DevOps was able to
increase their bill to improve their
build time by over 400% you know because
as your DevOps is a cloud hosted service
getting up and running is really simple
so Accenture is able to spin up new
projects in no time with Azure DevOps
now really the largest of all
organizations that use Azure DevOps is
Microsoft itself we have over 80,000
people that use it every month to ship
our saw
and the numbers are just staggering in
terms of the scale we do over 4 million
builds each month we do 500 million
tests executed every single day every
single day every we have over half a
million work items to get updated and
the number that I find the most
satisfying is that 78,000 deployments
are done with Azure pipelines every
single day which means there's a much
smaller window from when we write code
to when it gets to you which is better
for you and frankly it makes our
customers our developers happy too
because they have a much shorter wait
before what they've created gets in your
hands so I thought it'd be interesting
to actually show you how we use Azure
DevOps on a regular basis so of course
we use agile devops to build Azure
DevOps
so Donovan is going to give us a
walkthrough of our actual engineering
system the actual system that our
engineers are using right this minute to
build Azure DevOps so Donovan let's
taken us have a look thanks Jamie I love
that inception kind of work that we have
where you actually use the product to
build the product and we're not the only
ones inside of Microsoft that uses it we
obviously have the windows team some of
the Xbox teams and everyone's moving to
what we call our one engineering system
so what I thought it would be cool to do
is take you through like the day in the
life of an engineer on the azure DevOps
team and what they experienced to get
their work done using the product that
they build to build a product that they
use so here we have a dashboard imagine
you're coming into work and you see this
dashboard on your plasma screen or on
your surface and you can see exactly
what your team is working on what sprint
you're currently in how many days are
left you can go and see what work is
currently assigned to you how many bugs
you have out there you can see the
health of your builds your team members
what features you're working on and make
sure that you're focusing on the most
important things first this dashboard is
completely customizable yours can look
completely different have a great
library of widgets that you can use to
build it and what they're able to do
here very quickly is see exactly what
they're supposed to be focusing on so
that they can deliver the highest level
of value not only do we have great
dashboards but we also have product
backlogs backlogs are a priority list of
all the things that you want your
software
do you can simply drag and drop items
from here to assign them to a particular
sprint so you can start doing some
sprint planning as well I won't drag
anything now because as a Jamie pointed
out this is literally where we're
building the product and I don't want to
assign work to the wrong sprint I love
the fact that I can expand this and get
a really nice view of exactly all the
work necessary to turn one of these
ideas into a working piece of software
we also have the ability to have Kanban
boards this allows you to visualize the
movement of an idea from creation all
the way to being done and actually being
run in production and done for us means
it's actually being monitored in
production so that we can learn from the
telemetry and decide if our priorities
are in the right order and go back and
use that data we call it monitor and
learn again this is a very rich user
interface where we can simply drag and
drop these tiles are already assigned to
people and one of my favorite things
that we can do here is actually create a
branch right from the board for the work
that we want to go off and create so now
I'm using git we're using feature
branches I have a feature I want to go
implement I don't have to go off and
create the branch separately I can
create the branch right here from this
board and what happens up happening is
that work item now becomes associated to
that particular branch and that
traceability lives throughout the entire
course of this work so not only do I
have the branch tied to the work item
every commit is also associated every CI
build that is triggered every release
that is deployed is all traced back to
this particular work that I was doing
here I like being able to see every line
of code that I changed so I can do test
impact analysis and I don't have to go
running around to find it the system
actually gives that to me by simply
creating a branch once that branch is
created I go off and do my work and
here's our git repository and you can
see on the left hand side how all these
branches start to come back together
this allows me to visualize the branches
that were created the pull requests that
merge them back in the master to make
sure that we're delivering on our goals
we don't just go merging back into
master willy-nilly right that could be a
recipe for chaos so what we do instead
is we use a process called a pull
request a pull request is an opportunity
for our peers to review our code before
it gets merged back into master because
master is the law this is our golden
master and we want to protect that and
we protect it through a process called a
pork
if I were to come over here to the pool
request tab it shows me all the pull
requests that are currently running a
pull request is a chance for your
engineers to review each other's code it
also has the ability to run tests and
run builds against the code as well if I
were to drill in on one of these for
example I'll just pick a random one here
we'll be able to see everyone who's
involved in the commit we'll be able to
see everyone who has made changes what
lines they're on I could actually leave
comments on each individual line
discussing with the engineer what's good
and what's bad about these particular
changes if I wanted to I could see if
there's any conflicts the commits and we
also have policies applied to different
branches and the policy that we have
applied to our master branches you have
to survive a build and in that build we
run a lot of tests I believe if I
remember correctly
we're running somewhere near 83,000 unit
tests every single time you do a pull
request and if a single one of these
fails your entire pull request gets
stopped so we want to make sure there's
a lot of quality a high level of quality
because these are unit tests we can
actually run 83,000 of them in less than
20 minutes we're getting that signal
back to our developers very very quickly
and because they are supposed to pass
we've all had flaky tests in the past
and people start to ignore those we
worked really hard to make sure that
these are solid they're fast and they're
reliable such that if a single one of
them fails no one ignores that we go
immediately and figure out what failed
and we fix that code and we start this
process over again to ensure we only
ship the highest quality code to our
customers and to ourselves because we
are our first and biggest customer here
at Microsoft running all these unit
tests allow us to ship the highest
quality code to our end users and it
doesn't stop there we continuously run
tests against build after build release
after release to make sure that we only
ship high quality code and it behooves
us to do this because we're the first
people to get the code that we ship we
don't put it on to our customers unless
it survived time with us here at
Microsoft when you use the tool that you
build to build the tool that you use you
cannot risk having bad quality software
because it could stop everything that
you're doing as a matter of fact here is
our deployment plan and what's really
cool is we actually use safe deployment
here at Microsoft which means
we deploy two in a production
environment and we let the coat sit
there for 24 to 48 hours and it has to
survive our telemetry and our monitoring
and our daily use before we then allow
it to deploy to another environment this
first environment which is identified
here as ring zero is actually where the
Azure dev ops team actually works so
when we're pushing out new features
we're the first to fill those features
if we make a mistake or the only ones to
feel the pain of that mistake
we go back in and recorrect it after we
let it sit here and we monitor the
telemetry we check for any new work
items that have been logged for
particular bugs we make sure that it's
healthy and can sustain our traffic we
then promote it to the next string of
our deployment and we rinse and repeat
this until it gets all the way out into
production for all of our current users
so this is how we ensure and how we use
Azure devops to produce Azure DevOps for
our end users thanks Donovan now as you
saw as your DevOps is really a full
end-to-end solution across the entire
DevOps chain with great traceability
from the start all the way through to
the finish it's highly scalable from the
smallest team all the way up to the
largest team its Enterprise ready you
can run in whatever geo that you want so
you can keep the data close to home you
can run it in our cloud or we'll take
care of everything for you
or you can run it on premise with Azure
DevOps server which lets you install and
manage a cert the azure devops services
however you want you really have a
choice between a public and a private
cloud now Azure DevOps is the evolution
of visual studio team services which is
why we're able to capture so many of the
learnings and innovations that we've had
over the years and this evolution is
really based on the feedback that we've
gotten from customers and that cost that
feedback is about choice you know lots
of folks want to be able to use the full
end-to-end solution the way Donovan just
showed you but others want to have the
choice of just choosing a particular
part of it just using pipelines or just
using artifacts or just using boards and
putting them together however you want
and you're able to do that so you can
choose which parts of Azure DevOps you
want to use and assemble them with other
solutions so for example
if you wanted to use Azure boards to do
your planning and github to store your
source control and do your pull requests
but use Azure pipelines for your CIS CD
and take the artifacts that were
produced and put them in artifactory and
then use ansible to deploy them to AWS
or Google great you can do that you want
to mix and match you know however you
want if you want to use Azure artifacts
instead of artifactory and jenkins
instead of Azure pipelines
it's up to you you can assemble these
solutions in whatever form make sense to
you now this is really an evolution and
in a broadening of the azure ecosystem
so Azure DevOps now provide a juror with
a new set of services to help developers
make their lives better we're really
making a charade developer first cloud
as ur already has very broad support you
know there are hundreds of tools and
technologies many of them open source
that are part of that the azure
ecosystem from terraform to Jenkins to
chef to puppet you name it and Azure
itself has a whole set of first-class
services that are really important to
the DevOps lifecycle one category of
those is really focused on telemetry
analytics and insights
you know when Donovan talked about what
DevOps means to him and the definition
of it it's really clear that DevOps does
not stop with deployment you have to get
telemetry in your application you have
to know whether that application is
performing well how folks are using it
you know in this day and age data is
becoming a core part of how we build
software and asher has a whole set of
services that help you do that from
Azure monitor application insights and
log analytics they provide predefined
defaults so that you know what the
thresholds are you should be expecting
from a high-performing applications it
helps you visualize all of this data
it's coming in and customizable
dashboards and it has infrastructure to
help you separate the signal from the
noise because as we move into this more
data-driven world there's so much data
coming in it can often be hard to really
tell what the important signals are from
all of the different noise and of course
all of these services are highly
extensible and work with existing
processes and tools like ServiceNow
and this includes of course as your
DevOps so one of the really powerful
things that you can do is take all of
this telemetry insights and tie it in to
the actual workflow processes and in
terms of how you work and Donovan is
here to give us a walkthrough of how you
can do that
Donovan thanks Jamie like you said going
back to the definition of DevOps we want
to continuously deliver value you can't
just randomly copy files to a server and
assume that you delivered value if no
one uses them you didn't the only way
that you know is that you monitored the
application and here inside of azure we
have an amazing offering that allows you
to monitor not only the application
itself but the infrastructure upon which
it is actually running I can make sure
that my infrastructure is secure see if
there's any patches that need to be run
I can see my application health and I
can configure all of that using
application insights in addition to that
application insights ties in really well
inside of Azure DevOps and Azure
pipelines here I can go to our dashboard
that I've created this is the actual
application insights container or all
the data from an ojs application that
I've written is actually being pumped in
I'm able to see if I've had any failed
requests luckily I have not I'm able to
see what my server response time is if
that starts to go up or down I can go
back in and make adjustments to my code
ship out a new version and come back in
and check these numbers to make sure
that they're looking good I also have
availability tests running it's been
rock-solid since I deployed this I've
had a hundred percent success rate if
for any reason one of my applications is
unaccessible I will actually get a
notification saying I can no longer
reach your particular application and I
can actually test from several different
locations so it'll test from all the
different regions that we have available
for you from Azure to make sure that
your app is accessible from everywhere
and if not I'm able to go back in and
make it a fix for that what I really
like about this is that I can actually
incorporate this information back into
Azure pipeline so what I mean by that is
earlier I talked about how we use safe
deployment how we deploy our application
into a production environment and we
monitor it there well that monitoring
historically has been manual people
would go and run queries against our
work items to see if any new bugs had
been logged someone would go and look at
a dashboard like the one I just showed
you to see if there's any spikes in our
traffic or increase in the number of
we have but we want to automate
everything that we possibly can and
thanks to release management I can do
just that
I can come here and enable something
called a release gate a release gate is
an automated way for me to take those
tasks that I used to do manually and
verify them as I move through my
pipeline for her to add a node new gate
here you'll see there's several
different types I can run an arbitrary
function so this is an Asscher function
that can go off and do whatever it needs
to do and then send back either a
positive or negative response letting me
know that things are good or not I can
call a REST API
maybe I'm deploying a API myself and I
want to be able to call a few of those
api's beyond just normal testing but
specific API so let me know the health
of my particular system and this one I
like a lot is I can actually query
application insights that I just showed
you directly from Azure pipelines and
make sure that our we have my really
healthy deployment and that everything
is going as it's supposed to go and if
and only if it is move on to the next
environment I'll show you how to
configure one of those in just a moment
and also we have the querying the work
items this is the ability for us to go
back in and run queries and see have
there been any new bugs logs or new
issues logged against our software while
it's being deployed and if so you
probably want to stop our release and go
look at it right go ahead and click over
here on Azure monitor I just have to
configure a few things it's going to ask
me for my Azure subscription because
this is where my application insights
lives this is where the delet telemetry
is being collected and it allows me to
then find the exact application which I
want to monitor so I'll pick my Azure
account here inside of my Azure account
obviously have resource groups the
resource group I'm looking at that has
my kubernetes cluster in it and also my
application insights is expressed now I
want to look at application insights
information one more time I'm going to
tell the exact resource that I'm looking
at because I can actually have a
different application insights container
for every environment I don't want all
my telemetry going into the same place I
want to be able to know how my
production environments doing but might
be different than my QA environment and
or my development environment as I go
between one gate and another I can go
and review the previous environments
gates right here using application
insights then I'll choose a particular
alert and if I have any failure
anomalies during the deployment of my
code release Menace what we'll be able
to protect me and stop my release and
give me a signal letting me know that I
need to go back in and investigate that
this
is a potential bug that would have been
able to escape into the next environment
had I not had an automated way for me to
be able to monitor that information so
we're taking the monitoring and we're
automating that was the review of that
monitoring for you the final thing is
having that single pane of glass it's
great to have those really rich
dashboards in Azure but I want to be
able to bring the data that's being
collected by application insights
directly inside of Azure DevOps and I'm
doing that here with a dashboard that
I've been able to create as you can see
I have tiles here from my dev
environment my QA environment and my
production environment I can see how
many events have been triggered I can
see what my response time is and down
below I can see my team members the
health of my build and the health of my
release this again is taking all the
power and the data that we need to make
a good decision and have a really high
functioning piece of software and we're
surfacing it here right here in Azure
DevOps on a single pane of glass that we
can use so again I hope you realize any
language any platform and everything
that you need to turn an idea into a
working piece of software thanks Jaime
thanks Donovan so to pull all of this
back together
aser now has five new services that are
going to help you as developers to be
more successful to collaborate to ship
faster with higher quality they work for
any platform any cloud any operating
system you can use all of them together
or you can use them individually it's
all up to you they embrace open source
as your pipelines has free open source
for any project that once it
they work for projects of all shape and
size from the smallest up to the largest
and it's really easy to get started if
you want to get started you can go to as
recom slash DevOps and Donovan I think
that's about it did I miss anything
actually I have a few questions because
I'm gonna go on tour here soon and I'm
gonna speak bombarded with questions now
you said it's free for small teams but
what if I'm not a small team how do I
pay for this yeah so for Azure pipelines
you know if you're an individual doing
private build you get 800 3 minutes if
you'd like to grow up from that you buy
units of paralyzation you know you can
run more jobs at a time each one cost
$40 ok so if you buy a 10 new jobs you
can buy it run 10 jobs at the same time
$40 each gosh yeah most of the other
services you buy per user for about $6
you can go to the pricing page on our
website and get more details great so
obviously we've been using V STS for a
long time looks like the URLs are
changing like what is my experience
gonna be as a current V STS user moving
over to Azure DevOps yeah this is gonna
be a good thing for existing users the
transition is going to be seamless and
automatic the existing customers will
get to decide when they make that
transition so they can decide when the
right time to go do it for them is okay
if you're using all of the capabilities
of VST s all these as your DevOps
services like you showed work great
together they're not going to lose
anything they're just going to get more
choice
so if they want to set up a project and
only use it for planning and only have
as your boards on it for example they'll
have a much cleaner and better
experience for doing that sure yeah cuz
I've noticed that I've done that on a
couple I maintain a couple open source
projects and all I needed were pipelines
and it was really nice to be able to
streamline my experience right I mean I
and as the team gets bigger and as we
grow I think I'm gonna start turning
back on some of those other things but
for now is really neat to be able to
just streamline it and just let's just
focus on what it is that we want to work
on which is great but now we talked
about bsts but I always say that there's
a twin the bsts called TFS does how does
that transition work yeah so TFS is now
as your DevOps server okay it's still
the vehicle that we use to deliver all
the value we provide in the cloud one
premise the way that we ship it and
update it and the way you use it will
continue to be the same we'll continue
to update it on the same cadence that
been doing forever so it'll be again a
nice seamless transition for EFS users
as well right so that next quarterly
update I get it'll just gonna magically
change its name from one to the other
next major the next update of TFS will
be the azure DevOps server gotcha
awesome okay so the last thing I want to
talk about is just how do we get started
if I'm not an existing customer I'm
brand new I've seen this I'm excited I
see the value of cross-platform any
language any platform in one tool chain
how would I go and get started there's a
couple ways you know one if you want to
use as your pipeline and your github
user you can go to the github
marketplace like we looked at earlier
sure otherwise I suggest you go to Azure
calm slash DevOps pick the service that
you want to get started with and go from
there awesome well I thank everyone for
joining us but be sure and join us also
on September 17th we're gonna have a
live stream and a Q&A where you can ask
some more questions and interact with
those of us who helped develop this
amazing product and can answer your
questions and and make you productive on
your DevOps transformation thank you so
much for joining us thank you
you

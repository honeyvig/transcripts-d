hi everyone this is dr. Romney from Team
MDS conquer in this video we are going
to discuss that it is important points
from the topic of pharmacology point
number one atomic nervous system is also
called as visceral afferent number two
the autonomic system is divided into
sympathetic parasympathetic and in trick
number three in case of mid Rios's
contraction of dilated pupil a and
relaxation of spring tell people a
occurs whereas in case of meiosis
contraction of sphincter pupil and
relaxation of dilated pupil a occurs
number five receptors on skeletal muscle
and palate respond to acetylcholine and
nicotine number six alpha 1 receptor
prominently involves in vasoconstriction
point number seven
epinephrine when administered in IV can
decrease the blood flow to the skin
increased blood flow to the skeletal
muscle and increase the force and rate
of cardiac interaction number eight
muscarinic receptor mediates the side
effects of epinephrine in salivation
lacrimation urination and defecation
number nine the drugs that decrease the
motor activity and produce excitement
calmness and drowsiness are called
sedatives number 10 structure of gaba
receptor consists of two alpha to beta
and one gamma subunits point number 11
first benzodiazepine east chloride I see
boxes
number 12 try serum is short acting
hypnotic number 13 beta blocker without
local anesthetic least time alone number
14
peripheral side effects of levodopa
including nausea
hypotension cardiac arrhythmias can be
damaged by including carbidopa number 15
the anti-party narendra that cause
peripheral Raza spasm is
bromocriptine number 16 drug of choice
for treating decreased salivation a
company head and neck three radiation is
below carbon number 17 atropine toxicity
is treated by frieszo stigman point
number 18 rate limiting step for
norepinephrine synthesis is a tyrosine
judoka number 19
unpleasant side effect of salvia tamales
premise number 20 yurga no phosphates
inhibits aesthetic sight of Estelle
Collins number 21 drug commonly used in
narco analysis is scopolamine
hydrochloride number 22 botulinum toxin
produces skeletal muscle paralysis by
inhibiting release of acetylcholine
number 23 lumbar puncture is janet l3 l4
sight number 24 levodopa carbidopa enter
coupon combination of anti parkinson
drugs considered as appropriate therapy
number 25
ray Logan is metabolized in liver and
lung number 26 article has less
half-lives because of plasma
cholesterols number 27 they'd burn in
1967 proposed this style : theory number
28 the Estelle : theory stated that
Estelle : was involved in nerve
conduction in addition to its role as a
neurotransmitter at nerve synapses
number 29 the drawback of this theory is
there is no evidence that Estelle
Colleen is involved in neural
transmission along the body of neuron
number 30 succinylcholine which is a
depolarizing muscle relaxant is
metabolized by plasma cholesterols
number 31 approximately one out of every
two thousand eight 20 persons have an
atypical plasma cholinesterase number
thirty-two the patients have increased
risk of prolonged apnea if received
succinylcholine during general
anesthesia that's it for today's session
guys all the points discussed here are
very important from neat a names point
of view so keep on revising them all
there was thank you

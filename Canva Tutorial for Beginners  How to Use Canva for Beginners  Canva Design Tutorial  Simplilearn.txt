nature canva will sort you out so
without any further Ado then let's do
this okay so we will start off with
creating an account in canva and it's
completely free to begin with
um so you can sign up either with Google
with Facebook or traditionally with an
email address obviously I have an
account already so I didn't need to do
that so just
signing up and it's super easy and then
we will start designing all right
first
so in the top left you have got the main
navigation panel and you have got the
you know the returning of the home page
of course and then you have got the
templates and then obviously categorize
into different types you have got their
social media templates background
birthday marketing Educators so there
are various different templates for you
to browse and whenever you need
something you can just glaze through it
and see what they offer already in canva
you have got the features
let's see the features
section as well with the photo icons
print because canva now offers printing
as well
there are different apps you can have to
connect it with canva and some of the
use cases are there with different
Graphics charts video
teams you can invite your teams
different templates are there so there's
also the learn section which is super
important especially when you are a
beginner so after you watch this whole
video set up your account kind of get
the feel for what canvas I would highly
recommend you actually go to the learn
Tab and watch some of the kind of videos
um like how to create top designs logo
maker flyer maker
and then so that as a scene here you can
see how to learn how to connect and grow
your community here so they have uh give
you a quite few different features and
tips for you so the learn section is
really really important and I will
mention something at the very end of
this video as well a resource for you to
learn even more in depth then this video
is going to go but stay tuned I will
explain at the very end so this is what
the canva home page looks like there are
quite a few different areas to help you
navigate so I will explain each and
every one of those so that you can uh
you know where to go certain
functionalities over there so let's
start off with the top right panel uh
you have got your account so this way
you are and you can find a change of
your account settings you can set up
your profile photos as well and refer
your friend the things of that nature
then there is a create design button
which I will explain uh in a moment you
have got the setting in here the account
setting as well as there is a help
center so let's get back uh one minute
yes so and one of the most important
part is the search bar you can once you
have signed up for the free canva
account there are some difference
between the basic kind of free canva and
canva pro which I will explain at the
end of this video so make sure to watch
uh till the very end
um but at this point I'm just going to
use a free canva because this is what
the majority of people will use and need
so uh we'll just stick with it and then
at the very end I will explain it uh or
the details the first thing we want to
start off with is in the middle here's a
search bar and I have to say it's one of
the quickest way to find any template
any different design with specific
dimensions that you need to look for so
for example if I wanted to quickly
create an School poster so for that I
will go to create a design we'll take a
whiteboard
or we can
select okay I will select the Whiteboard
portrait
okay then after that we will
color the background first two decorate
it first we will take one frame for that
um
more about it
let's not to select a more designing
like let's select the simple one
or we can choose another one
after this uh we already taken the
Border like it is not that designy but
simple and so
not that much designy but simple let's
take a picture let's
find some pictures regarding School see
board
so as we know this is a poster for our
school so let's say let's write
um when adding course
maths
Olympia
quiz
let's change the font for this
now let's add some elements some images
that I have already installed I think
to decorate this poster for the school
let's take this metal
you can download these pictures from
Google and you can
uh actually paste it over here you can
download the pictures regarding your
topics whatever you are going to create
so these are some these are the
collection that I have
installed
like this you can create add all the
pictures whatever you have downloaded
you can add elements according to your
needs so
so this is how it looks
this is the final design for the scroll
poster for math Olympiad quizzer you can
add some if you want you can add some
more pictures over here you can edit uh
the color for the background you can uh
pick any frame regarding your posters
and your needs and I have add the medal
because it's Olympiad quiz and a bag as
a design for the school and some books
with the specs and pencil and it is a
all a bad quiz for the match so I added
the just uh uh to look attractive I add
this animation of math with the colors
and poster over here one Globe is there
and one pencil just to make it more
beautiful as it is a school poster so
this is the final poster for the school
math Olympiad quiz the next way we
create an advertisement in the Instagram
support so just go to create a design
once again and let's take this it's
already open source Instagram
poster for square
on portrait let's see how does it look
what is the size for this
okay this is perfect
let's
change the background color let's take
this
this
and just go to file and show margins
wait
okay
so after this
choose some elements to make the design
look you know so pre uh
ripping so now just choose some elements
to make your design look more attractive
and beautiful so we'll add some elements
um let's say Circle
we did in the mid
change the color for this let's take
okay change the color for the background
let's add one element over here
be a little darker in color and let's
suppose this
this
copy this
make a design with this let's make it
over here
you can add or just any elements
according to your needs so
a line over here
now and you can upload and choose any
image so as I've already downloaded one
image of a man
let's fix it over here fix it over here
okay
I just say image and
just make it look
stay image
and just
added the image with the saturation it
did be zero
after that
just add a text to your design
and suppose
and always keep in mind that always you
have to choose one font in any all the
design
so
you can adjust your letter size with
according to your design let's choose
one
take one one font for all the
list
okay
let's add another text over here
just adjust the size
adjust the size and it's
change the font for this two okay
foreign
[Music]
and always keep the same font
let's change the color for this
and let it be little darker
it's fine
now let's add another page
be this first
you can paste over here you can write
actually anything but for the design
let's
how does it look do you know then again
in
this actually we will keep it little
down over here
copy and paste it into down
as this is Effect one
so we'll
you can add a design to Carousel your
effect let's
an element again
you can copy from here
let's make a different color
foreign
foreign
say this as
just adjust the size and the alignments
of
the text
similarly you can add another page
with the same design with different
texts
they can
oh and again
you can add any other text away just for
creating and just want to show you how
does it work I'm just making this
change the color
you can add as many as you want
change the color for this also
yeah
so this is how does it
so this is how does it looks
so this is the final output how does it
looks
so next we will create a web page
so let's create a web design for the
game FIFA or the football let's create
it let's take a whiteboard
and let's take
side
nine
first we will choose a background color
let's give a theme so I have already
installed or downloaded one theme for
the
football
it's edit it and make it little
let's see more if it is there
yes
I want a background uh to be little
lighter so okay
this is fine a bit
it's good so we'll add elements first we
will upload a picture of a
man playing football one
on my first part let's
let's do this
and we'll create one
boundary first
let's give a background color as we have
foreign
to align it over here before that we'll
add a 100 rectangle
just as a margin
change the color for this
will be about section

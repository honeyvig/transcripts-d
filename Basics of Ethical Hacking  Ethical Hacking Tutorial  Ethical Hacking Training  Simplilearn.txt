foreign
ly digital world where technology has
become an integral part of our Lives the
importance of safeguarding our online
presence and protecting sensitive
information has never been a greater
enter the realm of ethical hacking a
field dedicated to identifying
vulnerabilities in computer system and
networks with the purpose of fortifying
their security they leverage their
technical expertise knowledge of
computer systems programming languages
and networking protocols to detect and
neutralize vulnerabilities ensuring that
organizations can proactively Safeguard
their digital assets however ethical
hacking goes beyond technical skills
alone
it requires a deep understanding of the
legal and ethical Frameworks that govern
the use of hacking techniques ethical
hackers must operate within legal
boundaries obtained proper authorization
and adhere to strict codes of conduct as
a result the increasing demand for cyber
Security Experts is apparent and
projected to grow in the coming years
Based on data from Glassdoor the average
annual salary for cyber Security
Professionals in United States is
approximately 92 000 and in India the
average annual salary is 12 lakhs per
annum and if you're an aspiring ethical
hacker then this ethical hacking Basics
course is just what you need to kick
start your Learning Journey this ethical
hacking basic course will cover the
following topics we will start with what
is ethical hacking with types of hackers
and who is an ethical hacker and moving
forward we will see ethical hacking
tools installing Kali Linux and the
basic commands Linux for ethical hacking
and so on with that in mind if you want
to embark on a successful career as a
cyber security professional then a
postgraduate program in cyber security
will be the right choice for you this
postgraduate program in cyber security
is designed to equip you with the skills
required to become an expert in the
rapidly growing field of cyber security
you will get foundational to Advanced
skills through industry leading cyber
security certification courses that are
part of the program fast track your
career in the field of cyber security
with this comprehensive curriculum
covering certification aligned courses
and the course link is mentioned in the
description box let's take a minute to
hear from our Learners who have
experienced massive success in their
careers hi I'm Philip I'm 61 years old
and last year I upskilled with simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security after working 30 years in the
I.T sector in various different profiles
I'm happy to tell you that I was able to
clear and pass my cissp and ccsp
certification exams on the first attempt
after taking the court of course I must
say was packed with practical examples
it was led by highly skilled certified
instructors I worked with many companies
before the security analysts and an
architect on a contract basis but I
needed some stability which I got with
the job I just started with Infosys as a
cyber security consultant happened after
I took the course be a learner first

let's talk about hacking and what
exactly hacking is hacking refers to
exploiting weaknesses in a computer
network to obtain unauthorized access to
information a hacker is a person who
tries to hack into computer systems now
here there are some keywords that we
need to understand first and foremost
exploit when you are exploiting
weaknesses weaknesses are technically
called vulnerabilities which are
basically design flaws misconfiguration
errors usage of default usernames and
passwords which have not been modified
so any misconfiguration or anything that
has been left behind by a Security
administrator that can be misused which
means exploited by a hacker to gain
unauthorized access so the next term is
unauthorized access something that you
are not allowed to do and when you say a
hacker is a person who tries to hack
it's basically a person with malicious
intent trying to gain access to a system
or a resource that they are not
authorized to access in the first place
how do they do it they find the
vulnerability that is a weakness or a
flaw and then they misuse it to gain
access to that particular Network so
here in the diagram you can see that a
sender on the left hand side is trying
to send some data to the receiver on the
right hand side the hacker would try to
gain unauthorized access to the
transmission that is being sent and
would try to capture the data packets
and read the secrets within let's look
at a business case scenario into hacking
now there is an organization everybody
is going around their own business when
they realize that their systems may have
been compromised now they're trying to
look at the customer data to ensure that
that has not been compromised Android
trying to assure their customers however
they do realize that some customer data
has been lost and even the company
reports have been modified as well now
this is the scenario where there have
been some security controls in place and
those controls have been identified they
realize that there is an attack that has
happened and based on that attack they
have realized that the data has now been
compromised and the records have been
modified uh by the hacker which means
that the data is no longer trustworthy
and thus cannot be used by the business
for any legal transactions so then the
hacker gives a call to the organization
or gets connected to the organization
demanding your answer for the data to be
replaced to be taken back into the
original state where it was trusted and
thus the organization can utilize it for
business transactions the organization
has probably no backup so they decide
that they want to pay the lump sum to
the hacker to restore that data so that
they can continue on with the business
does money exchanges and the hacker is
able to restore that data and the
business continues at as usual however
the activity here of a hacker trying to
Leverage The misconfiguration of the
weaknesses in the organization's
security thus being able to hack them
and make these ransomware demands so the
company then wants to figure out even if
having a security system in place how
was the hacker able to hack their
systems thus one of the employees comes
up with a brilliant idea of identifying
vulnerabilities in the network to
proactively search for any flaws that
have been left behind so that they can
plug those flaws and nobody can misuse
them thus they figure out that they want
to hire a ethical hacker who would help
them identify the security posture of
the organization identify the weaknesses
vulnerabilities and flaws and help them
remedy those flaws so that in future
scenarios these scenarios will not
happen so before we go into an ethical
hacker let's understand what are the
types of hackers so what are the types
of hackers hacker is a technically
skilled person who was very Adept with
computers they have good programming
skills they understand how operating
system works they understand how
networks work they understand how to
identify flaws and vulnerabilities
within all of these aspects and then
they understand and know how to pursue
use this flaws to get a outcome which
would be detrimental to the health of
the organization
so there's six type of hackers that have
been identified black hat hackers white
hat hackers gray hat script kitties
Nation spell sponsored hackers and a
hack twist so black hat hackers are
basically basically uh the malicious
hackers who have malicious intent and
have criminalistic Tendencies they want
to harm the organization by hacking into
their infrastructure by destroying their
infrastructure by destroying their data
so that they can gain from it from a
monetary perspective these guys are also
known as crackers the main aspect of
these people are that they have
malicious intent they try to do
unauthorized activities and they try it
for personal gain another important
aspect to remember is that a black hat
hacker will always try to hide their
identity uh they will spoof their online
digital identity by masking it by
spoofing their IP addresses Mac
addresses and try to remain anonymous on
the network a white ad hacker on the
other hand is also an ethical hacker or
a security analyst who's an individual
who will do exactly the same thing that
a black hat hacker would do minus the
malicious intent plus the intent of
helping the organization identifying the
flaws and remedying them so that nobody
else can misuse those vulnerabilities so
they are authorized to act on the
company's behalf they are authorized to
do that activity which would help the
company identify those flaws and thus
help the company mitigate those flaws
improving on their security posture so
these uh these kind of Security Experts
or ethical hackers would help
organizations defend themselves against
unauthorized attacks gray hat hackers is
a blend of both white hat and black hat
hackers so here they can work
defensively and offensively both they
can accept contracts from organizations
to increase their security posture at
the same time they can also get
themselves involved in malicious
activities towards other organizations
to personally gain or benefit from them
by doing unauthorized activity script
kiddies are people uh who are
technically not much aware about what
hacking is they rely on existing tools
that that have been created by other
hackers they have no technical knowledge
of what they're doing it's just a hit or
miss for them so they just get their
hands on a tool they try to execute
those tools if the hack works it works
otherwise it doesn't so these people are
basically who are noobs or newbies who
are trying to learn hacking or uh just
uh people who with malicious intent who
just want to have some fun or trying to
impress people around then we have the
nation or the state-sponsored hackers as
the name suggests these hackers are
sponsored by their government now this
may not be a legitimate job but most of
the governments do have hackers enrolled
in their pay on on their organizations
to spy on their enemies to spy on
various countries and try to figure out
uh the aspirations of those countries so
this is basically a spying activity
where you are technically trying to get
access to other countries resources and
then try to spy on them to figure out
what their activities have been or what
their future plans have been and then we
have the hacktivists who is an
individual who has a political agenda to
promote and they promote it by doing
hacking so these guys what is the
difference between a black hat hacker
and a hacktivist the black hat hacker
may try to hide their identity a
hacktivist will claim responsibility of
what they have done so for them it's a
political agenda a political cause and
they will try to hack various
organizations to promote their cause
they would probably do this by defacing
the website and posting the messages
that they want to promote on these
websites so what exactly is ethical
hacking then we have discussed the types
of hackers we have identified a
malicious hacker as a black hat hacker
with the intent of doing harm to an
organization's Network for personal gain
we have discussed what the ethical
hacker is so an ethical hacker would be
doing the same activity but in an
authorized manner so they would have
legal contracts that they would be
signing with the organization it would
give them a definite scope of what they
are allowed to do and what they are not
allowed to do and the ethical hackers
would function within those Scopes would
try to execute those at test scenarios
where they would be able to identify
those flaws or those system
vulnerabilities and then they would be
submitting a report to the management of
what they have found they would also
help the management to mitigate or to
resolve those weaknesses so that nobody
else can misuse them later on they might
use the same techniques and the same
tools that black hat hikers do however
the main difference here is that these
guys are authorized to do that
particular activity they're doing it in
a controlled manner with the intent of
helping the organization and not with
the intent of personal gains so who's an
ethical hacker again an ethical hacker
is a highly intelligent Highly Educated
person who knows how computers function
how programming languages work how
operating systems work they can
troubleshoot they're technically very
Adept at Computing they understand the
architecture they understand how various
components in a computer work they can
troubleshoot those components and they
can basically be very good with
programming as well now when I say
programming we don't want the ethical
hacker to be a good developer of
applications we want them to understand
programming in such a way that they can
create scripts they can write their own
short programs like viruses worms
Trojans or exploits which would help
them achieve the objective that they
have set out for so here you can see uh
the ethical hacker there are individuals
who perform a security assessment of the
companies with the permission of
concerned authorities so what is a
security assessment a security
assessment is finding out the exact
security posture of the organization by
identifying what security controls are
in place how they've been configured and
if there are any gaps in the
configurations themselves so an
organization will hire a ethical hacker
they would give the ethical hacker the
information about what information is or
what security controls what firewalls
the what idss ipss intrusion detection
or intuition prevention systems
anti-virus is already in place and then
they will ask the ethical hacker to
figure out a way to bypass these
mechanisms and see if they can still
hack the organization so let's talk
about a few of the tools that a ethical
hacker would you realize in the testing
scenarios to be honest there are
hundreds of tools out there what you see
on the screen as just a few examples of
them uh nessus is a vulnerability
scanner what is a vulnerability scanner
it is an automated tool that is designed
to identify vulnerabilities within hosts
within operating systems within networks
so they come with their ready-made
databases of all the vulnerabilities
that have already been identified and
the scan the network against that
database to find out any possible flaws
or any possible vulnerabilities that
currently exist on the host or the
operating system or on the network
similarly there would be application
scanners like akinetics or Arachne that
would help you scan applications and
identify flaws within those applications
as well now all of these are automated
tools the essence of ethical hacker is
when these tools churn out the reports
the ethical hacker can understand these
reports analyze them identify the flaws
and then craft their own exploits or use
existing exploits in a particular manner
so that they can get access or they can
bypass the access or security controls
mechanisms that are already in place how
can they do that with the tool called
Metasploit you see that Big M there on
the right hand side that M logo is for a
tool called Metasploit which is a
penetration testing tool what is a
penetration testing tool it is that tool
that will allow a ethical hacker to
craft their exploits or choose their
exploits for the vulnerabilities that
have been identified by nessus since we
are interacting with computers we will
always be interacting using tools right
so the first tool nessus identifies the
flaws and the possible list of
vulnerabilities we do a penetration test
using Metasploit to validate those flaws
and to verify that those flaws actually
exist and try to figure out the
complexity of those flaws and that's
where Metasploit helps us do that
Wireshark could be used in the
background while we are doing both the
activities using nessus or Metasploit to
keep a track of what packets are being
sent and by received on the network
which will help help us analyze those
packets so whenever I run an SS scanner
I would run a Wireshark in the
background it will capture the data
package and I can go through those data
packets and analyze that data package to
identify what nessus is actually trying
to do similarly when I try to attack a
machine using exploit on Metasploit I
will keep on Wireshark running in the
background to capture the data package
that have been sent and the responses
that I've received from the victim so
that I can also go through those packets
and analyze the responses and analyze
the attack whether it was successful to
what extent was it successful and
basically it will also give me a
validation of proof of the activity that
has happened nmap is another automated
tool that allows me to scan for open
ports and protocols so why would I use
nmap because Pro ports and protocols
become an entry point for a hacker to
gain access to devices for example when
we connect to a web server we connect
through a web browser but we
automatically connect to Port 80 using
HTTP and Port 443 is using https so if
I'm connecting to a web server using
https it is safe to assume that Port 443
on the web server is open to accept
those connections similarly there would
be other services that may be left open
on the web server because nobody thought
about configuring it or they
misconfigured the web server and they
left unwanted Services running so nmap
will allow me to scan those ports and
services and allow me to understand what
services are being offered on that
server so then I can start analyzing
that server identify those flaws within
those services and then try to attack
them if the application that I'm
analyzing is connected to a database and
I want to do a SQL injection attack or
if I if nessus tells me that there is a
SQL injection attack that may be
possible on that particular application
I can use an automated tool called SQL
map or SQL map that would allow me to
automatically craft all the queries that
are required for a SQL injection attack
and help me do that attack at the same
time so here I do not have to manually
create my own queries uh the SQL map
tool will automatically create them for
me what I would do is I would use nessus
to identify that particular flaw if
nessus reports that flaw I would then go
use the tool SQL map configure it to
attack that particular web server and
when I fire off the tool it will then
automatically start directing queries
SQL injection queries to the database to
see if those databases are vulnerable
and if yes what data can be retrieved
from those databases so all of these
tools in a nutshell would help me hack
networks applications operating systems
and host devices and this is what
ethical hacker does they use these kind
of tool sets they identify what attacks
they need to do they identify the right
tool for that particular attack and they
write their exploits they create those
attacks and then they start attacking
analyze the response and then give a
report to the management providing them
feedback about how the attack was
created or crafted what was the response
to that attack and whether that attack
was successful or not if successful they
would also give recommendations of what
to do to prevent these attacks from
happening in the future so when we are
doing these attacks or when we want to
launch these attacks what is the process
that we would follow so there are six
steps that we would do as an ethical
hacker if you are just a hacker you
probably wouldn't do the sixth step
which is a reporting step so the first
step that would be done is the
reconnaissance phase which is the
information gathering phase which is
very important from ethical hackers
perspective or a hacker's perspective
because if I want to attack someone or
something as a digital device I need to
know what I'm attacking I need to know
the IP address of the device the MAC
address of those devices I need to know
the operating system the build or the
version of that operating systems
applications on top the versions of
those applications so I know what I'm
attacking for example if I if I want to
attack a server I assume it's a Windows
based server and I use a particular tool
to attack it but it actually turns out
to be a Linux based server my attacks
are going to be on set successful so I
need to focus my attack based on what is
there at the other end so in my
information gathering phase I want to
identify all of that information once I
have that information done I'm going to
scan those servers using tools like nmap
that we just talked about and we're
going to try to see the open ports open
services and protocols that are running
on that server that can give me possible
entry points within the network or
within the device or within the
operating system at the same time along
with the scanning with nmap I would run
a vulnerability scanner the nasus
vulnerability scanner we talked about or
akinetics for applications and then I
would try to identify vulnerabilities in
those applications operating systems or
networks once I have identified those
vulnerabilities in the scanning phase I
would then move on to the gaining phase
where I would then craft my exploits or
choose existing exploits and start
attacking the attacking the victim at
this point in time if my attack is
successful I will probably have gained
access by either tracking passwords or
escalating privileges or exploiting a
vulnerability that I may have found
during the scanning phase once I have
gained my access I want to maintain my
access why because the vulnerability may
not be there for long maybe somebody
updated the operating system and hence
the flaw was no longer exist existing or
somebody changed the password that we
have I may have cracked thus I no longer
have access so what do I do to maintain
my access I installed Trojans or back
door entries to those systems using
which I can secretly in a covert manner
get access to those devices at my own
will at my own time as long as those
devices are available over the network
so that's where I maintain my access I
have hacked them now I want to maintain
my access so I install a software which
would give me a backdoor entry to that
device no matter what once I have done
this I want to clear my track so
whatever activity that I've been doing
for example installing a Trojan a Trojan
is also a software that would create
directory directories and files once
installed on the victims machine so I
want to hide that if I have access data
stores if I have modified data data I
want to hide that activity because if
the victim comes to know that something
has happened they would start they would
start increasing their security
parameters they might start scanning
their devices they may take them offline
thus my hack would no longer be
efficient the reason I'm clearing my
tracks is that the victim doesn't find
out that they have been hacked or they
have been compromised or even if they do
find out that they've been compromise
they cannot trace the compromise back to
me so I would be deleting references of
any of the IP addresses or Mac addresses
that I may have used to attack that
particular device and this is where I
will be able to identify where those
logs were created where those traces are
once I take off those traces the victim
would not be any wiser of whether they
have been compromised or who compromised
their system and if I am successful at
all of these stages or what to whatever
extent the success that I've achieved in
any of these stages I would then create
a report based on that and I would
report to the management about the
activities that we have been able to do
and whatever we have been able to
achieve out of those activities for
example we identified 10 different flaws
there were 20 different attacks that we
wanted to do what attack did we do what
was the outcome of that attack what was
the intended or or the expected output
of that attack I'll create a report
which would give a detailed analysis of
all the steps that were taken along with
screenshots and evidences of what
activity was conducted what was the
output what was the expected output and
I would submit that report to the
management giving them an idea of what
vulnerabilities and flaws exist in their
environment or their devices that need
to be mitigated so that the security can
be enhanced so these are the six steps
that the ethical hacking process would
take uh just going through this
recognizance is where you're going to
use hiking tools like nmap HP to obtain
information about targets there are
hundreds of tools out there depending on
what information you want then in
scanning again nmap next pose these kind
of tools to be utilized to identify open
ports protocols and services in gaining
access you're going to exploit the
vulnerability d by using the Metasploit
tool that we talked about in the
previous slides in the maintaining axis
you're going to install back doors you
can use metasquer at the same time you
can craft your own scripts to create a
Trojan and install it on the victim's
machine once you have achieved that
clearing tracks is where you're going to
clear all evidences of your activity so
that you do not get caught or the victim
doesn't even realize that they have been
hacked and once you have done all of
this we are going to create reports that
are going to be submitted to the
management to help them understand the
current security evaluation of their
organization so now let's see how we can
hack using social engineering now what
is social engineering social engineering
is the art of manipulating humans into
revealing confidential information which
they otherwise would not have revealed
so this is where your social skill and
your people skills come into the picture
if you are able to communicate
effectively to another person they would
probably give up more information that
they intended to give out let's take a
look at examples right if you see on the
screen phishing activity what is
phishing we receive a lot of frequents
on a regular basis we have always
received those emails where we have won
a lottery of a few million dollars but
we have never realized that we didn't
purchase a lottery to win a lottery in
the first place we have always had those
Nigerian frauds where the prince died in
some South African country and you out
of 7 billion people on the planet have
been identified where they want to
transfer a few hundred million dollars
through your account and they want to
give you 50 of that money in return as
thank you so some very basic attacks
where you go on to websites and there's
a banner flashing at you saying
congratulations you're the one millionth
visitor to this website click here to
claim your price all of these are social
engineering attacks phishing attacks
fake websites fake Communications being
sent out to users to prey on their
gullibility most of humans always have
that dream of striking it rich winning a
huge Lottery once and for all and living
their life lavishly ever after but sadly
in the real world that's not that
doesn't happen that that often and if
you're receiving those meals it is very
important that you first research the
validity of those those Communications
before you even want to act upon them so
why are humans susceptible to social
engineering because humans have emotion
machines do not try pleading with the
machine to give you access to a account
that you have forgotten a password to
the machine wouldn't even know what
you're doing try pleading with a human
sympathy or empathy where you could try
to create a social engineering attack
where you can plead with them saying if
I do not get access to this account
immediately I might lose my job and then
that would put my family into problems
somebody would feel empathy or sympathy
towards you and help you reset that
password and give you access to that
account it's how good the attack is and
how convincing you are for the success
of this attack to happen so what is a
familiarity exploit attackers interact
with victims to gain information which
will benefit the attackers to crack
credentials as passwords if we want to
reset our passwords what do we have as a
mechanism to resetting passwords we have
some security questions that we set up
those questions are nothing but personal
information that we would know but
through a social engineering attack we
it would be easily be able to gather the
information that you have set for your
security questions the security
questions can be as simple as the first
cool that you attended you probably have
that listed on your LinkedIn profile
where a per person can just go in there
and see your academic qualifications and
identify the school that you're in right
similarly it might also be a question
what was your mother's maiden name
that's a very good attack and that's uh
I mean if a person can interact with you
let's say they are trying to take a
survey and they approach you for a
feedback on a particular product that
you have been utilizing and they ask you
these questions you wouldn't think twice
before giving those answers as long as
the request sounds legitimate to us we
are able to justify that request we do
answer those queries so it's upon us to
verify the authenticity of the request
coming in before we answer it phishing
as discussed would be fraudulent emails
which appear to be coming from a trusted
source so in spoofing comes into mind
fake websites and so on so forth
exploiting human curiosity curiosity
killed the cat right so there was
there's so many physical attacks where
hackers just keep pen drives lying
around in a parking lot now this is open
a generic attack whoever Falls victim
will fall victim so if I just throw
around a few USBS in the parking lot
obviously with Trojans implemented on
them some people who are curious or who
are looking for a couple of freebies
might take up those pen drives plug them
in their computers to see what data is
on the pen drives at the same time once
they plug in there those pendrives on
their computers the virus or the Trojan
would get infected and cause harm to
their machine then exploiting human
greed we just talked about the Nigerian
frauds and the lotteries those kind of
attacks the fake money making gimmicks
now basically this is where you Prey
Upon the person's agreed kicking in and
they are clicking on those links in
order to get that money that has been
promised to them in that email so one of
the safest mechanism to keep data
private and to keep yourself secure is
using encryption now encryption can
happen through cryptography what is
cryptography cryptography is the art of
scrambling data using a particular
algorithm so that the data becomes
unreadable to the normal user the only
person with the key to unscramble that
data would be able to unscramble it and
make sense out of that data so we're
just making it unreadable or
non-readable by using a particular key
or a particular algorithm and then we
are going to send the key to the end
user the you end user using this same
key would then decrypt the data if
anybody compromises that data while it
is being sent over the network since it
is encrypted they would not be able to
read it so the encryption algorithm
would be something like this now if you
see uh the computer word once made into
unreadable format would look like eqor
xvgt for an end user it wouldn't make
any sense but the person who has a key
to unscramble that would be able to
convert it back to computer and then
understand the meaning of that word so
this is just a substitution Cipher that
is being shown on the screen so what is
the alphabet the key is alphabet plus
three so C plus three alphabets that
becomes e o becomes q m becomes o so the
key that is utilized to scramble the
data is the character that you are at
the third character from there would be
the corresponding key so the encrypted
message is also known as a cipher the
decryption is just the other way around
where you know the key now and you can
now figure out what that e corresponding
to by going back three characters in the
alphabet most of the times a certified
ethical hacker must decrypt a message
without knowing the secret key so let's
say a ransomware has affected your
organization or has affected a device
and you want to figure out uh or you
want to decrypt that data now as ethical
hacker you wouldn't be for paying a
ransom to the hacker would you so it is
now your prerogative of how you you're
going to work around and how you're
going to try to crack the encryption
mechanism how to crack the cipher to
decrypt that message and see what's
within it right decryption without the
use of a secret key that is known as a
crypt analysis Crypt analysis is the
reversing of an algorithm to figure out
what the decryption was without using a
key so Crypt analysis can be done using
various formats the first one is a Brute
Force attack second is a dictionary
attack third one is a Ringo table attack
a Brute Force attack is trying every
combination permutation and combination
of the key to figure out what the key
was it is 100 successful but may take a
lot of time a dictionary attack is where
you have created a list of possible
encryption mechanisms a list of possible
cracks and then you try to figure out
whether those cracks work or not rainbow
tables are where you have an encrypted
text in hand and you're trying to figure
out the similarities between between the
text that you have and the encrypted
data that you wanted to decrypt in the
first place so in the Brute Force attack
you're trying every possible combination
permutation of what the key would be in
dictionary attack you have a word list
that would tantamount to the key and if
you're you're trying to match all the
words listed in the text file or the
word list to see if any of those words
are going to work to decrypt the data
here in the rainbow table the ciphertext
is compared with another Cipher text you
find out similarities and then you try
to work a reverse engineer your way
accordingly so let's have a quick demo
on cryptography before we begin this
session so to begin with the demo of
cryptography we are on a website called
spammy.com which will help us scramble
the message that we created into a
completely uh format which would be
unrelated to the topic at hand so if I
say I want to encode a message I turn a
short message into spam so what this
does is you want to send across a secret
message you type in The Secret Message a
short one and it will convert that into
a spam mail you send it across so
whoever is reading that spam mail would
never get an idea of the embedded
message with in it so if I want to type
in a message here hi this is a secret
message the password is ASD at the rate
one two three four and I want to send
this out to people or to one of my
colleagues but I want to send it out in
a secret manner so that others are not
aware of this so when I press on encode
what the algorithm would do is it will
convert this message into a spam mail so
my message hi this is a secret message
the password is at the rate1234 or ASD
at the rate one two three four gets
converted into this now if you read it
dear e-commerce professional this letter
was specially selected to be sent to you
this doesn't make sense there is nowhere
or no reference to the actual message
that I've already sent so if I copy this
entire message and I send it let's say
via email to the recipient now the thing
is that the recipient needs to know that
I've encoded it using spam mimic the
algorithm needs to remain the same so
once they know that it is Spam mimic
what they can do is now in this instance
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open up a new browser and I'm going to
go to the same website and at this point
in time I am going to click on decode
when I click on decode I'm going to
paste the message that I have just
copied there we are and this message is
now being copied into a different
browser and if I decode this you will
see that it will convert it back to the
original message that there was so the
key is there at spam mimic and it is
embedded within the message so whenever
we paste the message in the decode
Factor it knows what the key was and it
can decrypt that message and give me the
actual message that was embedded within
it there we are the entire message this
is what we created in the Google Chrome
browser and in the Firefox browser we
decoded similarly if I want to protect
these kind of messages there is an
aspenencrypt.com website where let's say
we use text encryption and I want to
encrypt the same message this is a
secret message the the password is ASD
at the rate1234 and then I give it a
password to protect this message let's
say the word password and I use the
cipher to scramble this by using let's
say AES which is the strongest Cipher
right now and I say encrypt so this is
what the encryption would look like and
basically uh if I don't have the
password over here if I decrypt it you
would see that there it has occurred if
I type in the password over here and
then decrypt it it will be able to
convert that back into the unscrambled
text and it will give me what the
original message was this is a secret
message the password is ASD at the rate
one two three four so if I want to keep
my data secure from hackers I want to
scramble it in such a way that they
would not be able to crack it or it
would be very difficult from for them to
crack it and this is one of the first
mechanisms that would be recommended by
any ethical hacker to keep the data
secure so let's talk about a few of the
tools that a ethical hacker would
utilize in the testing scenarios to be
honest there are hundreds of tools out
there what you you see on the screen as
just a few examples of them nessus is a
vulnerability scanner what is a
vulnerability scanner it is an automated
tool that is designed to identify
vulnerabilities within hosts within
operating systems within networks so
they come with their ready-made
databases of all the vulnerabilities
that have already been identified and
the scan the network against that
database to find out any possible flaws
or any possible vulnerabilities that
currently exist on the host or the
operating system or on the network
similarly there would be application
scanners like acunetics or Arachne that
would help you scan applications and
identify flaws within those applications
as well now all of these are automated
tools the essence of ethical hacker is
when these tools churn out the reports
the ethical hacker can understand these
reports analyze them identify the flaws
and then craft their own exploits or use
existing exploits in a particular manner
so that they can get access or they can
bypass their access or security controls
mechanisms that are already in place how
can they do that with the tool called
Metasploit you see that Big M there on
the right hand side that M logo is for a
tool called Metasploit which is a
penetration testing tool what is a
penetration testing tool it is that tool
that will allow a ethical hacker to
craft their exploits or choose their
exploits for the vulnerabilities that
have been identified by nessus since we
are interacting with computers we will
always be interacting using tools right
so the first tool nessus identifies the
flaws and the possible list of
vulnerabilities we do a penetration test
using Metasploit to validate those flaws
and to verify that those flaws actually
exist and try to figure out the
complexity of those flaws and that's
where Metasploit helps us do that
Wireshark would be used in the
background while we are doing both the
activities using nessus or Metasploit to
keep a track of what packets are being
sent and by received on the network
which will help us analyze those packets
so whenever I run an SS scanner I would
run a Wireshark in a the background it
will capture the data package and I can
go through those data packets and
analyze that data package to identify
what nessus is actually trying to do
similarly when I try to attack a machine
using exploit on Metasploit I will keep
on Wireshark running in the background
to capture the data package that have
been sent and the responses that I've
received from the victim so that I can
also go through those packets and
analyze the responses and analyze the
attack whether it was successful to what
extent was it successful and basically
it will also give me a validation of
proof of the activity that has happened
nmap is another automated tool that
allows me to scan for open ports and
protocols so why would I use nmap
because Pro ports and protocols become
an entry point for a hacker to gain
access to devices for example when we
connect to a web server we connect to a
web browser but we automatically connect
to Port 80 using HTTP and Port 443 is
using https so if I'm connecting to a
web server using https it is safe to
assume that Port 443 on the web server
is open to accept those connections
similarly there would be other services
that may be left open on the web server
because nobody thought about configuring
it or they misconfigured the web server
and they left unwanted Services running
so nmap will allow me to scan those
ports and services and allow me to
understand what services are being
offered on that server so then I can
start analyzing that server identify
those flaws within those services and
then try to attack them if the
application that I'm analyzing is
connected to a database and I want to do
a SQL injection attack or if I if nessus
tells me that there is a SQL injection
attack that may be possible on that
particular application I can use an
automated tool called SQL map or SQL map
that would allow me to automatically
craft all the queries that are required
for a SQL injection attack and help me
do that attack at the same time so here
I do not have to manually create my own
queries uh the SQL map tool will
automatically create them for me what I
would do is I would use nessus to
identify that particular flaw if nessus
reports that flaw I would then go use
the tool SQL map configure it to attack
that particular web server and when I
fire off the tool it will then
automatically start directing queries
SQL injection queries to the database to
see if those databases are vulnerable
and if yes what data can be retrieved
from those databases so all of these
tools in a nutshell would help me hack
networks applications operating systems
and host devices and this is what
ethical hacker does they use these kind
of tool sets they identify what attacks
they need to do they identify the right
tool for that particular attack and they
write their exploits they create those
attacks and then they start attacking
analyze the response and then give a
report to the management providing them
feedback about how the attack was
created or crafted what was the response
to that attack and whether the attack
was successful or not if successful they
would also give recommendations of what
to do to prevent these attacks from
happening in the future so when we are
doing these attacks or when we want to
launch these attacks what is the process
that we would follow so there are six
steps that we would do as an ethical
hacker if you are just a hacker you
probably wouldn't do the sixth step
which is a reporting step so the first
step that would be done is the
reconnaissance phase which is the
information gathering phase which is
very important from ethical hackers
perspective or a hackers perspective
because if I want to attack someone or
something as a digital device I need to
know what I'm attacking I need to know
the IP address of the device the MAC
address of those devices I need to know
the operating system the build or the
version of that operating systems
applications on top the versions of
those applications so I know what I'm
attacking for example if I if I want to
attack a server I assume it's a Windows
based server and I use a particular tool
to attack it but it actually turns out
to be a Linux based server my attacks
are going to be unsuccessful so I need
to focus my attack based on what is
there at the other end so in my
information gathering phase I want to
identify all of that information once I
have that information done I'm going to
scan those servers using tools like nmap
that we just talked about and we're
going to try to see the open ports open
services and protocols that are running
on that server that can give me possible
entry points within the network or
within the device or within the
operating system at the same time along
with the scanning with nmap I would run
a vulnerability scanner the nasus
vulnerabilities scanner we talked about
or acunetics for applications and then I
would try to identify vulnerabilities in
those applications operating systems or
networks once I've identified those
vulnerabilities in the scanning phase I
would then move on to the gaining phase
where I would then craft my exploits or
choose existing exploits and start
attacking the attacking the victim at
this point in time if my attack is
successful I will probably have gained
access by either tracking passwords or
escalating privileges or exploiting a
vulnerability that I may have found
during the scanning phase once I have
gained my Axis I want to maintain my
Axis why because the vulnerability may
not be there for long maybe somebody
updated the operating system and hence
the flaw was no longer exist existing or
somebody changed the password that we I
may have cracked thus I no longer have
access so what do I do to maintain my
access I installed Trojans or back door
entries to those systems using which I
can secretly in a covert manner get
access to those devices at my own will
at my own time as long as those devices
are available over the network so that's
where I maintain my access I have hacked
them now I want to maintain my access so
I install a software which would give me
a backdoor entry to that device no
matter what once I have done this I want
to clear my track so whatever activity
that I've been doing for example
installing a Trojan a Trojan is also a
software that would create directory
directories and files once installed on
the victims machine so I want to hide
that if I have access data stores if I
have modified data I want to hide that
activity because if the victim comes to
know that something has happened
happened they would start they would
start increasing their security
parameters they might start scanning
their devices they may take them offline
thus my hack would no longer be
efficient the reason I'm clearing my
tracks is that the victim doesn't find
out that they have been hacked or they
have been compromised or even if they do
find out that they've been compromised
they cannot raise the compromise back to
me so I would be deleting references of
any of the IP addresses or Mac addresses
that I may have used to attack that
particular device and this is where I
will be able to identify where those
logs were created where those traces are
once I take off those traces the victim
would not be any wiser of whether they
have been compromised or who compromised
their system and if I am successful at
all of these stages or what to whatever
extent the success that I've achieved in
any of these stages I would then create
a report based on that and I would
report to the management about the
activities that we have been able to do
and whatever we have been able to
achieve out of those activities for
example we identified 10 different flaws
there were 20 different attacks that we
wanted to do what attack did we do what
was the outcome of that attack what was
the intended or the expected output of
that attack I'll create a report which
would give a detailed analysis of all
the steps that were taken along with
screenshots and evidences of what
activity was conducted what was the
output what was the expected output and
I would submit that report to the
management giving them an idea of what
vulnerabilities and flaws exist in their
environment or their devices that need
to be mitigated so that the security can
be enhanced so these are the six steps
that ethical hacking process would take
uh just going through this recognizance
is where you're going to use hiking
tools like nmap HP to obtain information
about targets there are hundreds of
tools out there depending on what
information you want then in scanning
again nmap next pose these kind of tools
to be utilized to identify open ports
protocols and services in gaining access
you're going to exploit the
vulnerability by using the Metasploit
tool that we talked about in the
previous slides in the maintaining
access you you're going to install back
doors you can use meta square at the
same time you can craft your own scripts
to create a Trojan and install it on the
victim's machine once you have achieved
that clearing tracks is where you're
going to clear all evidences of your
activity so that you do not get caught
or the victim doesn't even realize that
they have been hacked and once you have
done all of this we are going to create
reports that are going to be submitted
to the management to help them
understand the current security
evaluation of their organization so now
let's see how we can hack using social
engineering now what is social
engineering social engineering is the
art of manipulating humans into
revealing confidential information which
they otherwise would not have revealed
so this is where your social skill and
your people skills come into the picture
if you are able to communicate
effectively to another person they would
probably give up more information that
they intended to give out let's take a
look at examples right if you see on the
screen phishing activity what is
phishing we receive a lot of frequents
on a regular basis we have always
achieve those emails where we have won a
lottery of a few million dollars but we
have never realized that we didn't
purchase a lottery to win a lottery in
the first place we have always had those
Nigerian frauds where a prince died in
some South African country and you out
of 7 billion people on the planet have
been identified where they want to
transfer a few hundred million dollars
through your account and they want to
give you 50 of that money in return as
thank you so some very basic attacks
where you go on to websites and there's
a banner flashing at you saying
congratulations you're the one millionth
visitor to this website click here to
claim your price all of these are social
engineering attacks phishing attacks
fake websites fake Communications being
sent out to users to prey on their
gullibility most of humans always have
that dream of striking it rich winning a
huge Lottery once and for all and living
their life lavishly ever after but sadly
in the real world that's not that
doesn't happen that often and if you're
receiving those meals it is very
important that you first research the
validity of those Communications before
you even want to act upon them so why
are humans susceptible to social
engineering because humans have emotion
machines do not try pleading with the
machine to give you access to a account
that you have forgotten a password to
the machine wouldn't even know what
you're doing try pleading with a human
sympathy or empathy where you could try
to create a social engineering attack
where you can plead with them saying if
I do not get access to this account
immediately I might lose my job and then
that would put my family into problems
somebody would feel empathy or sympathy
towards you and help you reset that
password and give you access to that
account it's how good the attack is and
how convincing you are for the success
of this attack to happen so what is a
familiarity exploit attackers interact
with victims to gain information which
will benefit the attackers to crack
credentials as passwords if we want to
reset our passwords what do we have as a
mechanism to resetting passwords we have
some security questions that we set up
those questions are nothing but personal
information that we would know but
through social engineering attack it
would be easily be able to gather the
information that you have set for your
security questions the security
questions can be as simple as the first
cool that you attended you probably have
that listed on your LinkedIn profile
where a person can just go in there and
see your academic qualifications and
identify the school that you're in right
similarly it might also be a question
what was your mother's maiden name
that's a very good attack and that's uh
I mean if a person can interact with you
let's say they are trying to take a
survey and they approach you for a
feedback on a particular product that
you have been utilizing and they ask you
these questions you wouldn't think twice
before giving those answers as long as
the request sounds legitimate to us we
are able to justify that request we do
answer those queries so it's upon us to
verify the authenticity of the request
coming in before we answer it phishing
as discussed would be fraudulent emails
which appear to be coming from a trusted
source so email spoofing comes into mind
uh fake websites and so on so forth EXP
providing human curiosity curiosity
killed the cat right so there was
there's so many physical attacks where
hackers just keep pen drives lying
around in a parking lot now this is open
a generic attack whoever Falls victim
will fall victim so if I just throw
around a few USBS in the parking lot
obviously with Trojans implemented on
them some people who are curious or who
are looking for a couple of freebies
might take up those pen drives plug them
in the computers to see what data is on
the pen drives at the same time once
they plug in there those pendrives on
their computers the virus or the Trojan
would get infected and cause harm to
their machine then exploiting human
greed we just talked about the Nigerian
frauds and the lotteries those kind of
attacks the fake money making gimmicks
now basically this is where you Prey
Upon the person's agreed kicking in and
they are clicking on those links in
order to get that money that has been
promised to them in that email so one of
the safest mechanism to keep data
private and to keep yourself secure is
you using encryption now encryption can
happen through cryptography what is
cryptography cryptography is the art of
scrambling data using a particular
algorithm so that the data becomes
unreadable to the normal user the only
person with the key to unscramble that
data would be able to unscramble it and
make sense out of that data so we're
just making it unreadable or
non-readable by using a particular key
or a particular algorithm and then we're
going to send the key to the end user
the you end user using this same key
would then decrypt the data if anybody
compromises that data while it is being
sent over the network since it is
encrypted they would not be able to read
it so the encryption algorithm would be
something like this now if you see uh
the computer word once made into
unreadable format would look like eqor
xvgt for an end user it wouldn't make
any sense but the person who has a key
to unscramble that would be able to
convert it back to computer and then
understand the meaning of that word so
this is just a substitution Cipher that
is being shown on the screen so what is
the alphabet the key is alphabet plus
three so C plus three alphabets that
becomes e o becomes q m becomes o so the
key that is utilized to scramble the
data is the character that you are at
the third character from there would be
the corresponding key so the encrypted
message is also known as a cipher the
decryption is just the other way around
where you know the key now and you can
now figure out what that e corresponding
to by going back three characters in the
alphabet most of the times a certified
ethical hacker must decrypt a message
without knowing the secret key so let's
say a ransomware has affected your
organization or has affected a device
and you want to figure out uh or you
want to decrypt that data now as ethical
hacker you wouldn't be for paying a
ransom to the hacker would you so it is
now your prerogative of how you're going
to work around and how you're going to
try to crack the encryption mechanism
how to crack the size effort to decrypt
that message and see what's within it
right decryption without the use of a
secret key that is known as a crypt
analysis Crypt analysis is the reversing
of an algorithm to figure out what the
decryption was without using a key so
Crypt analysis can be done using uh
various formats the first one is a Brute
Force attack second is a dictionary
attack third one is a rainbow table
attack a Brute Force attack is trying
every combination permutation and
combination of the key to figure out
what the key was it is 100 successful
but may take a lot of time a dictionary
attack is where you have created a list
of possible encryption mechanisms a list
of possible cracks and then you try to
figure out whether those cracks work or
not rainbow tables are where you have an
encrypted text in hand and you're trying
to figure out the similarities between
between the text that you have and the
encrypted data that you wanted to
decrypt in the first place so in the
Brute Force attack you're trying every
possible combination permutation of what
the key would be in dictionary attack
you have a word list that would tend to
mount to the key and if you're you're
trying to match all the words listed in
the text file or the word list to see if
any of those words are going to work to
decrypt that data here in the rainbow
table the ciphertext is compared with
another Cipher text you find out
similarities and then you try to work a
reverse engineer your way accordingly so
let's have a quick demo on cryptography
before we begin this session so to begin
with the demo of cryptography we are on
our website called spammy.com which will
help us scramble the message that we
created into a completely uh format
which would be unrelated to the topic at
hand so if I say I want to encode a
message I turn a short message into spam
so what this does is you want to send
across a secret message you type in The
Secret Message a short one and it will
convert that into a spam mail you send
it across so whoever is reading that
spam mail would never get an idea of the
embedded message within it so if I want
to type in a message here hi this is a
secret message the password is ASD at
the rate one two three four and I want
to send this out to people or to one of
my colleagues but I want to send it out
in a secret manner so that others are
not aware of this so when I press on
encode what the algorithm would do is it
will convert this message into a spam
mail so my message hi this is a secret
message the password is at the rate one
two three four or ASD at the rate one
two three four gets converted into this
now if you read it dear e-commerce
professional this letter was specially
selected to be sent to you this doesn't
make sense there is nowhere or no
reference to the actual message that
I've already sent so if I copy this
entire message and I send it let's say
via email to the recipient now the thing
is that the recipient needs to know that
I've encoded it using spam mimic the
algorithm needs to remain the same so
once they know that it is Spam mimic
what they can do is now in this instance
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open up a new browser and I'm going to
to go to the same website and at this
point in time I am going to click on
decode when I click on decode I'm going
to paste the message that I have just
copied there we are and this message is
now being copied into a different
browser and if I decode this you will
see that it will convert it back to the
original message that there was so the
key is there at spam mimic and it is
embedded within the message so whenever
we paste the message in the decode
Factor it knows what the key was and it
can decrypt that message and give me the
actual message that was embedded within
it there we are the entire message this
is what we created in the Google Chrome
browser and in the Firefox browser we
decoded similarly if I want to protect
these kind of messages there is an
aspenencrypt.com website where let's say
we use text encryption and I want to
encrypt the same message this is a
secret message the password is ASD at
the rate1234 and then I give it a
password to protect this message let's
say the word password and I use the
cipher to scramble this by using let's
say AES which is the strongest Cipher
right now and I say encrypt so this is
what the encryption would look like and
basically if I don't have the password
over here if I decrypt it you would see
that there it has occurred if I type in
the password over here and then decrypt
it it will be able to convert that back
into the unscrambled text and it will
give me what the original message was
this is a secret message the password is
ASD at the rate one two three four so if
I want to keep my data secure from
hackers I want to scramble it in such a
way that they would not be able to crack
it or it would be very difficult from
for them to crack it and this is one of
the first mechanisms that would be
recommended by any ethical hacker to
keep the data secure now let's talk
about downloading and installing Kali
Linux along with that we'll also be
looking at the basic commands that are
required for Kali Linux all right so
I've opened my browser and we want to go
to the Kali website so we want to go to
kali.org you can directly type in
kali.org and go to the website I can
just do a Google Search and say Kali
download and it will give you the same
website but it will directly take you to
the downloads pages so either here and
or you can go to the home page cookies
are being installed on your machine so
see which cookies you want to allow I'm
only going to use the necessary cookies
to support this site and you can see
that this gives you the latest Kali
Linux news and tutorials gives you the
latest release what is in that release
and gives you a lot of documentation
which will help you understand what
tools have been developed and what
functionality has been given in the
latest version if you want to download
you can directly go here and you can
download Kali Linux now Kali Linux is a
2.6 gigabyte download so it's going to
take time the latest version being
2019.4 and we click over here I'm using
a download manager to manage all these
huge downloads and you can see it's
pointed to the operating systems folder
and it is going to be a 2.57 and GB
download so you click on download and in
the background you can see this is going
to be downloaded and we're going to
minimize this and it will take a few
minutes for that to download but this is
an ISO image so we need to install it on
a virtual machine so what we need is we
need to use a hypervisor which will
allow us to create virtual machines so
we can either use VMware Workstation
which you can download from here however
this is paid version so you can see it
is around 250 or something for this
software but it is a very good software
to have so if you click on download now
it is going to start the download it's a
30-day trial period if you want to use
it after 30 days you'll need to enter
the key which you will get after
purchasing the software if you do not
want to utilize this the free version
that you have you can either download
VMware Player but there are some
limitations for VMware Player that you
might want to look at does you want to
compare these products before you want
to purchase them right otherwise you can
download Oracle virtualbox which is a
free hypervisor it's not as robust as
VMware Workstation but it does the trick
right so the the free version 6.1 is
free and you can then create your own
virtual machines over there and install
operating systems on them what I do have
I already have a VMware Workstation
installed so I'm just going to open that
up and that's my VMware Workstation as
you can see I already have a lot of
virtual machines created over here what
we're going to do is we are going to
configure a virtual machine for the Kali
Linux operating system that we are
downloading which should be somewhere
here let's see it's at 43 percent so all
halfway there till then let's create the
virtual machine so I click click on file
create a new virtual machine I am going
to customize the machine so click on
next this will be default we don't want
to change that and then we want to
install the operating system later we
don't want to point it out right now so
I'll just click on I will install the
operating system later click on next we
want to install Linux now in the drop
down you would not see Kali Linux over
here however you can choose Ubuntu
64-bit that's what I'm going to choose
there it is next what is the name that
we want I want to give it Kali Linux
without the typo and I want to store it
in one of the folders that I created by
default it stores on the C drive which
is not a good place to store you don't
want to run out of space on your C drive
so I'm going to click on this PC and
this is my data and in here I'll have a
folder called virtual box a virtual
machines there it is within which you
can see the other softwares that I
already created I'm going to create a
new folder and call it Kali 2019 l l for
is latest for me because you can see
already have a Kali Linux so I'm just
going to identify this folder with the L
at the end I'm going to select it and
click on okay you can see the path being
changed over here click on next it's
going to ask you how many processors now
depending on the processor that you have
you can see I've got the 8 core i7 so if
I give it 16 cores or 16 processors
that's not going to work I cannot go
beyond what the physicality already is
so for this machine One processor with
one core is more than enough if you're
going to use a lot of tools at the same
time you might just want to give it two
cores so you're given it two cores it
will ask us for Ram to be provided for
this Virtual Machine by default 2048
megabytes that's 2GB of RAM is more than
enough if you require more we can change
this later on so click on next we want
to use Nat for now leave this default
next whatever is recommended keep it the
way it is we do not want to change it
next create a new virtual hard disk for
this machine and it is going to ask us
the size 20 GB is more than fine store
it as a single file we don't want to use
multiple file options click on next and
then click on browse wherever you want
to store the vmdk file or the virtual
hard disk file and we go back again to
the same folder that we had created
virtual machines and we look at the Kali
Linux Kali 2019 L and we want to store
the vmdk file over there once we save it
we want to click on next and then we
want to click on finish so this is the
virtual machine that has been created
right here right now this is the basic
configuration now where are we at with
the operating system and you can see the
operating system has been downloaded and
it is stored in this particular folder
so we go to e Drive so we're looking for
the sub the operating system that we
have downloaded we downloaded in the
operating systems folder and if we go in
here you can see the current one the
Kali Linux 2019.4 ISO right here so what
we do we go back to the Kali Linux
machine that we have created edit
virtual machine settings and we point
this virtual machine using the CD DVD
and then we point the iso the one that
we downloaded over here so we go back to
e Drive we go back to OS and we click on
Kali Linux 2019 click on open so now
when this boots up it will boot up with
this ISO and then it will allow us to
install the operating system so click on
OK then we click on power on this
virtual machine it will start powering
on it will boot to the iso and it will
start giving us the booting options so
I'm just going to enter the full screen
mode over here for this to be better
visible and we don't want the live mode
what we want is we want to use the
graphical install and then we highlight
that we press enter and you can see the
setup starting up we'll wait for the GUI
to pop up there it is which language do
we want for now we want English click on
continue where are we located click on
continue and the configure your keyboard
we want the US keyboard American English
continue it is going to detect the
hardware so as you can see on the screen
it's attempting a auto configuration for
most of these settings the network with
DHCP it has identified the network cards
Hardware like the processor that has
been provided or is asking for a host
name we're going to leave it at default
we're going to click on continue domain
name team I'm not joining this into a
domain as yet there's going to be a
standalone machine so I can leave this
blank click on continue now it is going
to configure the network it is asking
for a password at this point in time the
root password type in any password that
you want ensure that you remember the
password now by default the username for
the account is the name is the word root
we are just creating the password for
the root account and then we want to
click on continue setting of The Clock
looking at the hard disks now here it
asks us do we want to use the entire
disk the 20 GB virtual hard disk that we
had provided or do we want to give it a
manual configuration or a guided one
where we want encryption and a logical
volume management coming into the
picture we're just going to use the
first option guided you use entire disk
don't worry it's only going to use the
virtual disk that we had created click
on continue it will give us that it's a
21.5 GB VMware virtual disk that we had
and click on continue all files in one
partition that's what we want
recommended for new users whatever it is
we don't want to change these folders
continue and this is what we have
configured once we click on continue it
is going to say you are you sure you
want to make these changes click on yes
click on continue and it will start
installing Kali Linux on your device now
this is going to take a few minutes for
the installation to work all right so
that's the installation that's completed
now it's asking us to configure a
package manager a network mirror can be
used to supplement the software that is
included on the installation media this
may also make new versions of software
available you want to use a network
mirror we can click no for now and then
click on continue now this is going to
install the grub bootloader this might
take a few minutes as well install the
group grub loader to the master boot
record yes click on continue click the
hard disk that you have just utilized
this is the one click on continue it
will install the grub bootloader running
through the last phases of the
installation and now it says the
installation is complete we want to
click on continue finishing the
installation and then it will do a
reboot all right and here you can see
this is starting up so we are going to
use you just wait out the boot and now
it started the booting sequence just
going to maximize the screen and you can
see it's asking me for the password this
is the one that we created now that's
the that's not the password that's the
username that's the root and the
password that we had created at that
point in time and then click on login
and this is your screen uh now what we
need to do here is we need to install
VMware tools which will help us manage
the screen and help the virtual machine
to be a little bit better integrated on
the system so that's not mounted yet so
we're just waiting for it to Mount there
it is and what we want to do here is
open VMware tools of Creator all right
so what we want is we want to extract or
we want to use this openx archiver and
once we do that we'll see the VMware
install.pl double click on that all
right we've got the VMware tools here
what I've done is we have extract to and
have extracted that on the desktop right
so what we just did was click on the
desktop over here open and this is what
it will do and click on extract now
there is happening because I've already
extracted this open this up we want to
run this VMware install dot PL so what
do we do we open up the terminal window
which is the command line interface over
here and now this is where some of the
commands come into the picture so for
example PWD will show us the present
working directory LS will show us the
list of the folders there there so the
folder that we have is on our desktop so
we'll just change directory to desktop
press enter do an LS that will show us
the list and you can see VMware tools
this trip that's the folder that we have
right here right so we want to go into
that folder CD VMware at this point you
can just click on Tab and it will
populate everything over there press
enter do an LS and we want the VMware
hyphen install dot p L to be executed
all right so we tried executing that
command we had an error over there so
what we need to do is we need to execute
this command so dot slash VMware in a
hyphen install.pl and we'll start
creating now it will ask you for your
input installing VMware Tools in which
directory do you want to install the
binary files uh by default it is going
to see you slash USR slash bin if I just
press enter it is going to use the
default as you can see the input over
here what directory do you want the any
directories I'm just going to press keep
on pressing enter for the defaults to
come in this part does not exist it is
going to create it default yes defaults
everywhere and then it tries to start
initializing it to maximize the screen
and this is where it is installing and
you can see by just installing that it
automatically existed the screen and now
we got a full screen of Kali Linux right
here right and that is what VMware tools
does for us once we have installed the
operating system and now you can see see
the entire screen on here you will see
the tool sets that are given here now
why are we using Kali Linux in the first
place because this comes in with a
bundle of thousands of softwares that
are ready to be utilized for ethical
hacking right and they have been
categorized over here for information
gathering vulnerability analysis web
application analysis and so on so forth
so you can see for forensics on Goods
reporting tools and as you scroll down
you can see your development tools
Graphics coming in Internet and the
system configuration coming into the
picture these are your settings for your
operating system so these are basically
your tools we are right now on the
favorites if I click on the information
gathering you will see that other tools
for information gathering start
appearing over here for vulnerability
analysis we have got scarter in map
fuzzing tools web application analysis
we have got comics skip fish SQL map
database assessments password attacks
and so on so forth so if you just go in
the favorites this was the terminal
emulator that we utilized this is the
command line that we saw we use the CD
command to use the PWD command we did
the ls command as well to give us the
list of the directory that we are in
similarly there would be commands like
cat so let's go to CD downloads let's
see what the uh what's there you can see
this case sensitive so if I type in a
capital D and then do a tab LS there's
nothing over here on download so CD dot
dot will take us back One Directory now
you can see we are back from downloads
to root if I want to go to desktop this
is how I go to desktop do a LS you can
see the VMware tools uh folder over
there CD VMware tools and we go into
that folder LS which will give us the
list of all those files now you can see
install is a file that we had edited
back then so if I do a cat install you
will see the cat basically is the
command that will help us look at the
contents of the file all right without
opening up the file or without editing
the file so you can see just if I scroll
up this is where we give the cat command
it then printed the contents of the file
over here and then it exited and gave me
back to command line right here right
now if I want to copy this CP root
desktop VMware install and if you want
to copy it to root downloads and press
enter now what we are going to do is we
are going to see if this file the
install file that we just edited over
here has been copied to the downloads
folder so we do us we are currently in
the VMware on the desktop VMware tools
District folder video CD dot dot that
takes us down One Directory so we are
still in the desktop do a CD dot dot now
you can see we are back in the root and
now we are going to do a CD downloads
run LS and you can see the copied file
right here so if I do a cat install you
can see the same content of that file
coming in so these are some of the
commands that we would need to learn as
we go ahead the remove command is let's
say we've got install we do a man RM man
is the manual page command point that
gives us the pages with the description
of how that particular command is to be
utilized so our image remove files or
directories synopsis the description the
options hyphen f for Force hyphen I for
prompt hyphen capital I prompt ones
before removing more than three files
and so on so forth if you want to exit
this you can press Q to exit and you
come back to this page so if I say RM
install LS you'll see that the install
file has now been deleted so in Windows
we use the Del Dell command in Linux it
is the RM command so this is what we
wanted to look at the demo for Kali
Linux how to download it how to install
it and some of the basic commands that
we can utilize
python is a computer programming
language often used to build websites
and software
it can also be used to automate tasks
and conduct data analysis
python is a general purpose language
meaning it can be used to create a
variety of different programs and isn't
specialized for any specific problem
this versatility along with its beginner
friendliness has made it one of the most
used programming languages today
a survey conducted by industry analyst
from Red monk found that it was the most
popular programming languages among
developers in 2020
python is commonly used for developing
websites and software task automation
data analysis and data visualization
since it's relatively easy to Learn
Python has been adopted by many
non-programmers such as accountants and
scientists for a variety of everyday
tasks like organizing finances
it has become a staple in data science
allowing data analysts and other
professionals to use the language to
conduct complex statistical calculations
creating data visualizations build
machine learning algorithms manipulate
and analyze data and complete other data
related tasks
python however is mostly used to create
scripts rather than full-scale programs
a python script the file containing the
commands is structured to be executed
like a program these files are designed
to contain various functions and import
various modules
python interactive shell or the
respective command line is used to
execute the script to perform a specific
task a script is structured by defining
the set of function definitions and then
stating the main program used to call
the functions
program consists of numerous tasks these
tasks can be executed with the help of
scripts unlike libraries scripts can be
used without importing and are less code
intensive
python variable assignment is different
from some of the popular languages there
is no Declaration of a variable just an
assignment statement when we declare a
variable in C or C plus plus or any
other unlike languages this sets aside
an area of memory for holding values
allotted by the data type of the
variable the memory allocated will be
interpreted as the data type suggests at
compile time initial value will be
checked
so we cannot mix the data types in
between but python is a dynamically
typed language it doesn't know about the
type of the variable until the code is
run so the Declaration is of no use what
it does is it stores that value at some
memory location and then binds the
variable name to that memory container
this makes the contents of the container
accessible through that variable name so
the data type does not matter
it will get to know the type of the
value during runtime
python also offers multiple options for
developing GUI or graphical user
interface out of all the GUI methods
decanter is the most commonly used
method it is a standard python interface
to the TK GUI toolkit shipped with
python python with decanter is the
fastest and easiest way to create GUI
applications
Python programming languages is widely
used by companies around the world to
build web apps analyze data automate
operations via devops and create
reliable scalable Enterprise
applications
many companies do not even realize they
are using python across their
organizations for example if a company
is a Java only company but they use ibmf
sphere as a web application server then
they have to use Python to script the
server's configuration
python has a habit of getting in
everywhere regardless of whether the
usage is intentional
big names like Microsoft Netflix Google
Uber and Dropbox regularly use python in
the software framework development
now that we understand Python's basic
functionality let's cover some of its
advantages when compared to Industry
counterparts
when it comes to third-party modules the
python package index also known as pypi
contains several third-party modules
that allow python to communicate with
the majority of other languages and
system
it has functions that are separate to
the python code base and has many extra
capabilities that can be activated later
on
python also contains a vast standard
library that covers topics such as
string operations internet protocols web
services tools and OSI interfaces
many joint programming tasks have
already been coded into the standard
Library considerably reducing the amount
of code that a new developer must write
python is open source due to a lack of
official technical support which has
driven the establishment of communities
that increase the Resource Bank for the
language's continuing growth and
acceptance its source code development
is partnered with multiple coders and
receives Community feedback well
features are often shared with the
community to Garner feedback before
pushing them onto the main branch
python includes built-in data structures
such as lists and dictionaries that may
be used to create quick runtime data
structures furthermore python has added
benefit of dynamic high-level data
typing decreasing the support code
length required
data structures are the set of data
elements that produce a well-organized
way of storing and organizing the data
in the computer so that it can be useful
for example the data structures like
stack queue linked list Etc are mostly
used in the field of computer science
artificial intelligence and Graphics Etc
we have now covered all the features
python offers and the basic
functionalities
let's write some real-time python code
that can crack passwords using Python's
libraries
in this demo we will write two blocks of
code both of which offer a unique way to
break passwords the first one is a Brute
Force attack the other is a dictionary
attack
the difference with Brute Force attack
is that in brute force a large number of
possible key permutations are checked
whereas in the dictionary attack only
the words with the most possibilities of
success are checked and are less time
consuming than Brute Force
so let's jump into the code editor now
the code editor we are using today is
spy charm
pycharm serves as an IDE for running
Python program specifically and can be
downloaded for free as a community
Edition
now the first thing we are going to
start is by importing some libraries
the first one would be
the random Library
this one would be necessary to generate
the random choices from which the
password will be guessed
next we're going to import another
Library
known as P by Auto g y
this is necessary to generate a
graphical user interface where the user
will be asked to enter the password to
be cracked
next we're going to create a variable
called as
cache
this will hold the number of characters
it will store all the characters which
can be used in our password
so we're going to start with
all the alphabets
and just to be safe we're going to add
all the digits as well from 0 to 9. now
this can be expanded further to include
special characters but we're going to
skip that for this example
next we're going to turn this variable
into a list this is necessary so that we
can Traverse the list accordingly
so we're going to create a new variable
All Care
and convert this into
a list
and there we go
regarding the user they are asked to
enter a password that needs to be
cracked the password will be entered
into a graphical user interface and can
be stored in a variable
let's take it as PWD
we're going to use the py auto gy
function to generate the GUI
the type of input will be a password
input so that the values entered are not
visible
we're going to write a message such as
enter a password
okay that's it
let's skip the semicolon over here
the user will see this message on the
graphical user interface and can then
enter a password
now the passwords that are being guessed
need to be stored somewhere so we're
going to create a sample
PWD password
and just enter
a null value to go with
now we're going to start generating
random values that need to be checked
for that we're going to use a while loop
and the condition that we are going to
run is sample password which will be our
guest password should not be equal to
PWD which is the original password now
this Loop will run as long as the values
are not same the moment the sample
password which is the password guest and
Generator randomly becomes equal to the
original password this Loop will be
closed and the program will be over
so we're going to start generating by
assigning the value of sample PWD is
equal to going to use the random dot
choices function
and the arguments we're going to pass as
all cap which is the list of all the
values that need to be checked or more
like all the characters that can be used
to Generate random choices and for the
length we're going to assign a value of
K which will be the length of the
original password
the original password which is entered
we're going to check the length using
the Len function and make sure that the
random choices function generates
passwords of that lens specifically now
we can skip this so that it checks for
all the possible variations and all the
different lengths but that will take
time so we're going to stick with
something small for this example
next we're going to print out a message
where we can see the number of values
that are being checked
we can put up a simple message
such as this
we're going to check the string value of
sample PWD
and we're going to close the message
that's it
now this is the one that generates the
random choices we also have to check the
choices with the original password so
we're going to set up an if condition
over here
and we're going to write if sample PWD
is the same as PWD or we have to use the
list version
of PWD since sample PWD in itself will
be a list
if it is true we're going to print
the password
is
going to put up a space
and we're going to join
the new one
uh
this will display the guest password
we can break over here so that we run
out of the if condition and the loop now
let's run this code once
to run mean
okay as you can see we have missed a
colon sign over here in the while
function
so we're going to run it now
as you can see we have the GUI that is
asking the password for us
now we can give a small password so that
we can see if it's working or not
we're going to write
PC2 and since we have given the data
being input as dot password it's not
going to show what is being entered over
here
I have entered the password of a b c 1
so press OK and you can see it's going
to check the combinations of four digit
passwords now this doesn't follow a
specific order
so this works on generating random
choices we can create programs that goes
a specific order as a single permutation
like we're going to start from zero zero
zero and move on to zero zero zero one
that's typically how normally Brute
Force password crackers work but this is
easier to examine and we can see how the
program is being worked on using this
if we're going to stop it for now
and give it another try
going to run mean
I'm going to try something else
and you can see it keeps running up the
same program and this time I ends enter
the password of abc2 and you can see in
one of those random choices it did find
out my password like I said we can do
this using a systematic method where it
goes from the first option to the very
last one but this is more easier to
explain and more easier to visualize as
a first program
now regarding our next program which is
going to be a dictionary attack a
dictionary attack uses a word list a
word list will cons will have a list of
passwords that can be used or a list of
possible outcomes
we're going to start
by importing some libraries on its own
here we need to use only import hashlip
because the password that we are going
to enter will be a hashed version we're
not going to give the plain text
password in an input like we did in the
previous program so to work on those
hash and the functions that are
necessary to work on those hashes we're
going to use this Library
we also want to set up a counter
of pass found
this is necessary to know if the
password has been found or not when we
do find the right password we can change
the value of this counter and the
program and the inter filter will know
that our program has been completed
the password that the user will enter
needs to be in a hash format so we're
going to keep it in a variable known as
let's say I hash
we're going to ask the user for the
input
enter the
hashed password
and there we go
next
we're going to use the word list over
here to use the word list we need to
open it how can we do that let's take up
a variable known as P dock
we're going to ask the user for an input
going to move on to the next line using
the backslash n command and write
enter
password file name
including path
so what we are asking over here is we're
going to ask the user for a particular
path in the local system where the file
has been opened up
once the user gives the file name path
we can open it and store it in a file
let's say p file
and we're going to use the file option
functionalities of python okay
okay now it is of python
we're going to use the path stored in
pdoc and open in read mode only
next we're going to set up our Loop
which is going to check every single
password with the hashed password we're
going to use a for Loop we're going to
carry out every word in the open file
over here foreign
next as we know we have received a
hashed value of the password we need to
convert it into standard terms before we
can start comparing
first what we have to do is we have to
encode the hashed password into a common
variable known as the utf-8 standard now
there's a good chance that it is by
default in utf-8 encoding but running
this line helps us in being sure that
the next few lines work correctly
we're going to store another variable
known as hash word
this is after the encoding
where we're going to use another hashlip
function which is the md5
so that we can convert the value
found in ENC word
and keep it in a hashed format
now that we have made it clear that we
now the hash can be read and run by the
computer we're going to get the final
hash digest of it now to strip the hash
digest we're going to store it in our
value let's say of name Digest
we will use the value generated above in
hash word
and right
hex Digest
this will generate the hash digest of
the password and query store it in this
digest variable now
we have the digest so we can start
comparing it to the password file that
we have found we're going to write a
loop such as if digest is equal to the
input hash which is the hashed password
that the user input
then
we can just print
password
found
which we can then
show
using whatever value has been extracted
right now from the password file or the
word list
we're also going to change the variable
of the pass found counter to 1 and we're
going to break
now let's say that we do not find a
password
we have to inform the user that the
password is not found in the particular
word list so we're going to write
another loop let's say if not
pass found
now think of it from a systematic way
the default value of pass found is zero
let's say we do find a password in the
word list the value is getting changed
to 1. so at this point of time the value
of password should be 1 if the password
has been found
if not 1 which basically implies if 0
since 1 is considered as true and 0 is
considered as false if it is 1 this part
of the if condition will not be executed
this part will only be executed if no
password is found and by default the
value of pass found is 0 so if not 0
will turn it to F1 which is supposed to
be true and the following lines will be
executed
so the next few lines we're going to
print that the password was not found
and we can start running the program
foreign
password we're going to use an online
tool and as the md5 hash generator.com
now let's say our user password is the
same as the one we used in the last
program which is abc2
we're going to generate the hash if
we're going to copy the md5 hash over
here we press on copy
and we're going to paste Ctrl V and
press enter now this password file name
is asking for the location of the word
list now I have stored the word list in
my D drive with the name of P1 dot txt
this file has a list of passwords which
also include the word abc2 in there
so go to press enter
as you can see it has found the password
abc2 after doing the hash
functionalities over here
now if you were to remove it
let's say we're going to use our wrong
password for example
if you're going to create a new value
such as of ABC 5.
and take this new hash value
we're going to rerun this program
and we're going to use a new hash value
which is not present in the current word
list
as you can see we are now getting the
expected password node Pawn
functionality
so this way the password has been
cracked open with two different types of
attacks using a brute force and a
dictionary attack since this type of
methodology works on a word list this is
known as a dictionary attack as it has a
source of passwords where it can check
the possible outcomes from
or discus who is a certified ethical
hacker what makes a certified ethical
hacker what skills would be required and
what would be the expectation what is CH
version 10 and how would this
certification help you become a
certified ethical hacker what is new in
version 10 so what's the difference
between the previous versions and what
has been introduced in this version that
is going to benefit us more then we're
looking at the roles and
responsibilities that are required of a
certified ethical hacker and why would
people want to become a certified
ethical hacker in the first place what
are the career options and what would
they be required for and then we're
going to look at the exam we're going to
look at an overview we're going to look
at how the exam is structured what
domains are there in their exam what
weightage these domains have and we are
going to look at a sample questions as
well we are going to discuss those
questions and we're going to discuss the
answers and why those answers are
correct uh why the other options in
those answers are not then we'll be
looking at Job rules after CH version 10
which you would be eligible to apply for
and based on on the knowledge that you
have you can get these kind of job roles
and these job roles will also help you
understand what kind of requirements
there are in the marketplace as well so
you can study from that perspective and
then we'll be looking at what kind of a
salary to expect from a certified
ethical hacker now let's begin with who
is a certified ethical hacker a
certified ethical hacker is a person
who's also known as an ethical hacker an
ethical hacker is just the opposite of
an hacker a hacker is a person who with
malicious intent tries to misuse
vulnerabilities that they have
identified in an organization structure
and then gain access to unauthorized
data whereas an ethical hacker does the
same thing they try to locate the
weakness they try to look at the
vulnerabilities and they see how they
can be misused however the intent is
completely different and that is what
differentiates a hacker from an ethical
hacker hacker would be a criminal with a
malicious intent who would try to misuse
and personally gain by doing criminal
activity from that political activity
that they have done whereas a ethical
actor would try to have of the
organization in an authorized manner so
that's where the permission comes into
the picture the ethical hacker has
permission from the organization to
conduct some activity that would
identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses
in the information technology structure
of that organization and then once they
have been identified practical hacker
would then help the organization to plug
those vulnerabilities rather than misuse
those vulnerabilities so any person who
completes CH version 10 certification is
known as a certified ethical hacker so
there's a certification once you
complete that once you pass the exams
you can essentially call yourself as a
certified ethical hacker and you're
going to get a certificate with the same
terminology so as you can see in the
diagram your responsibility would be as
a certified ethical hacker would be with
the proper permission of the
organization with the authorization
coming in with contracts coming in you
would legally help the organization to
identify those weaknesses and
vulnerabilities and once you find them
you're going to report them to the
organization and you're going to help
the organization with remediation plan
which should help them remediate
mitigate and resolve the vulnerabilities
that you have identified thus making the
organization's security structure a lot
better based on which black hat hackers
or malicious hackers would be unable to
attack the organization so what is CH
version 10. now this course was
initially introduced in September 2015
and I think if you look at the
versioning this is the 10th version that
is there in the market so essentially CH
or the certified ethical hacking course
as the course itself has been for a long
time in the industry it's a very well
accepted course and it's a well-renowned
course the current version as it is was
introduced in September 2015 and is one
of the toughest certifications in the
cyber security field this includes a lot
of information that you have to learn
that you have to know before you can
attempt the certification you will
master all ethical hacking methodologies
that are used in penetration testing and
ethical hacking situations what does
that mean that means that CH version 10
is a structure course that will help you
look at all the phases that are used in
ethical hacking all the terminologies
that are utilized all the tools that are
utilized in such a manner that you can
penetration test or a vulnerability
assessment and identify and test the
vulnerabilities for their complexity and
this course once you complete the course
you would have mastered all the ethical
hacking techniques that are required
there are two exams one is a written
exam and the other is a practical exam
now you can opt for either or the
written exam is basically a multiple
choice question exam where they'll ask
you scenario based questions and you
have to answer those questions that is
something that we are going to look into
during this video the Practical exam is
basically a simulation exam where they
give you a scenario and you have to
complete some complete those tests and
prove that you are a good ethical hacker
based on the report that you give if the
report tallies to what the test was you
would be clearing that exam so practical
exam is a little bit tougher it's more
Hands-On it tests this actual skills
that you would perform in a hacking
scenario a ethical hacking scenario does
the Practical exam going to be that much
tougher the written exam to give it
Credence tests you a lot on your
mentality on your thought process on
your judgment characteristics so they
will give you a scenario and ask you
what do you think is happening what does
this attack tantamount to or would be
then what what would be the next step in
the particular attack that they are
describing does it's more of an
intellectual test where you're when your
thought processes are being checked and
you are giving those examples so what
would be the difference between these
exams in a practical exam you would be
conducting all those steps yourself and
you would be reaching a conclusion so
here essentially you're being tested on
the skills that you have developed on
the execution part of it and to see
whether you can execute a test end to
end whereas in a written exam you will
be put in the middle of a test where you
have to assume something where you have
to understand what the steps would have
been performed in the in the previous
steps and what would be the expected
result and you're supposed to analyze
that and and then come to the correct
answer so if there's a question which
which exam is better written or
practical the answer to that is from
intellectual perspective a written exam
would be a lot tougher than a practical
exam and from an execution perspective a
practical exam would be tougher than a
written exam so it depends on us which
exam we want to give both of them are
widely accepted and well respected in
the information security field so it's
just the option that we choose which
exam we want to give now this course the
version 10 course is purely attack based
course okay it is an offensive course
there is no defensive mechanisms so if
you're looking for questions of how to
secure yourself on the internet how to
securely configure operating system or
how to securely configure a server how
to configure a firewall this is not the
certification this basically talks about
attacking those devices so if you come
across a firewall how would you test a
firewall how would you identify
vulnerabilities in those and how would
you bypass a firewall similarly if you
come across a server how are you going
to attack and hack the server Let It Be
Windows online based so this basically
becomes attack based course you're
looking at offensive mechanisms over
here and not defensive ones at all so
what's new in this version in this
version there's a new module for iot
Internet of Things it focuses on
emerging attacks vectors like Cloud
artificial intelligence and machine
machine learning it basically talks
about smart devices and it talks about
the vulnerabilities the risks that the
smart devices face in today's world for
example it will tell you about the
industries that are utilizing all these
smart devices why are they utilizing it
for what kind of devices they are
utilizing and what are the risks within
those devices it will also give you a
lot of tools for you to practice upon to
identify such iot devices what would
constitute an iot or Internet of Things
device any device which has an IP
address and can connect to the internet
and create data so even your smart watch
your smartphone your cars that have
internet connectivity nowadays uh your
Google homes Amazon Alexa's all of these
devices would come under the iot
umbrella and have you ever wondered
about about sitting at home having a
Wi-Fi having all of these devices even a
smart TV if you will connected to the
Wi-Fi and have you ever questioned how a
hacker would then be able to access your
home through all of these devices record
information and basically just spy on
you similarly an organization where
they're utilizing iot they would be
vulnerable for the same vulnerabilities
and this course does include iot
security to a certain extent where we
talk about vulnerabilities and how to
identify those vulnerabilities in iot
then there's a new vulnerability
analysis module where it gives you risk
assessment it talks about CVSs scoring
systems it talks about how to do a
vulnerability Management program in the
first place what are the steps required
in a vulnerability Management program
how should it be reputable and how it
should be measurable as a program and
what should be the outcome so basically
it will give you a structured way of how
to do a vulnerability management
assessment and how do you want to
achieve the end goal thus leading you to
a penetration test so all the modules
are leveled up what do you mean by
leveled up that means have been updated
to the latest tools latest standards
latest Technologies so we've got
cryptographic attacks you have got
attacks on applications like SQL
injection we will be talking about
packet sniffing using various tools all
of these are upgraded which means they
are up to the latest operating system so
even when we do this course you'll be
looking at operating systems like
Windows 10 Windows 8 Windows Server 2012
Windows Server 2016 Kali Linux machines
Android machines and Ubuntu desktop as
well so all of the operating systems are
latest the tools are latest and you will
be interacting with these tools and then
there's a mobile security toolkit as
well which will help you do a
penetration test on a mobile device so
these are what is new in version 10. now
let's talk about the roles and
responsibilities that ethical hacker
should have when they actually go into
the world now what are the
responsibilities roles what are the
capabilities that we should have that we
should be able to look at scripts that
would test for vulnerability so for
example a SQL injection attack it's a
screen base attack let's say cross-site
scripting attack that is again going to
be a script based attack so we uh maybe
we want to go ahead a little bit look at
Windows systems and do a Powershell
attack and know about partial scripting
a little bit if you look at Linux
Windows there's a bash shell where there
is Bash scripting and you'll want to
learn that scripting as well now the
course doesn't include all these
scripting languages it does help you
understand what these scripting
languages are and it does have some
basic introduction to how these
languages can be utilized to create
those scripts then we also want to
develop tools to increase security you
want to look at those commands that are
utilized on all operating systems you
want to look at the capabilities of the
operating systems of how to create
security parameters and ensure the
operating systems and applications
devices are secure uh you should be able
to perform risk assessment now when you
say risk assessment risk assessment is
the likelihood of an attack being
actually executed on an organization
based on the threats and the
vulnerabilities that we have identified
so risk assessment is something that you
find out about vulnerability and then
you try to figure out in a hypothetical
manner of what is the likelihood of that
vulnerability being exploited by a
hacker if they find that vulnerability
and if they do execute that what is the
impact that is going to happen on the
organization and what is the penalties
or the repercussions that the
organization is going to face if that
vulnerability is exploited that's what a
risk assessment is then we should also
be able to develop security policies a
set of security policies and Implement
them to ensure that the security
mechanisms are standardized and are
consistent and then we should also look
at training staff for network security
to ensure that they are aware of these
vulnerabilities and they know what the
responsibilities are to maintain some
semblance of security in the
organization so why do we want to become
a certified ethical hacker now since
you're watching this video it's easy to
assume that we all are interested in
security we all are interested in
hacking but hacking is not a real job
for us to get a job in the industry on a
security parameter or information
security parameter we want to become a
certified ethical hacker so if you look
at the popular hacking cases that have
happened in 1990s there was a national
Crackdown in criminals Microsoft NT
operating system was hacked now this was
back in the 90s when security wasn't
that much evolved and there were a lot
of attacks back then uh that crippled
infrastructure that crippled Banks when
they started realizing that Computing
isn't as easy as it seems of course if
you use a computer the functionality is
always there but if the functionality is
not properly configured you're just
exposing yourself to cyber criminals
where they're going to steal information
and your organization may just go
bankrupt because of that in 2013 an
example Adobe reported 2.9 Million
accounts as stolen in 2016 Cash Plus key
which is Internet Security firm uh
announced that there was 758 million
malicious attacks that occurred
worldwide imagine that 758 million
malicious attacks that were identified
and reported in 2018 Facebook reported a
loss of 30 million ends to accounts that
were stolen 2018 again quora reported
100 million customer accounts being
stolen and in 2018 again Marriott 500
million Travelers accounts stolen and
manipulated now when you see a
conference tool and how does it affect
the organizations now first and foremost
if those accounts were stolen that means
usernames and passwords were cracked and
those accounts may have contained credit
card information or may have contained
some personal information that would
identify the personal uh the person and
does make them gullible for a social
engineering attack or an identity theft
attack so it has a cascading effect if I
would have been affected or you would
have been affected with these attacks
the repercussions would have been
catastrophic your credit card
information being stolen that means
somebody else would have misused it and
you would have seen a huge bill come to
you come your way now you can go back to
the bank and dispute that but that
that's again a dispute that you're
trying to have with the bank for
something that you didn't do which
requires a lot of energy and a lot of
time and at the end of it somebody has
to pay for that particular loss now in
this scenario the bank would have had to
Bear the loss but then that's a loss for
the bank and bank doesn't want to do
that and that's where they would try to
hire certified ethical hackers who will
try to test these vulnerabilities and
plug them in so that the end consumer is
also secured the bank is also secure
right in this case uh Marriott there
were 500 million Travelers accounts that
were stolen a lot of credit card
information uh was uh leaked out email
email accounts were hacked and
compromised and thus there was a lot of
replication that happened now the thing
is that there are also laws that these
organizations need to adhere to that
tell the organizations how to keep their
information secure and also have
penalties in place if the organization
gets hacked and the penalties are pretty
severe so organizations do not want to
get hacked or do not want to get
compromised not only from the customer's
perspective where they would be losing
customers losing reputations and then
thus facing losses but also from a
legislative perspective where they would
have to pay fines to the government for
the frauds that have happened so these
are some of the popular hacking cases
that have caused these organizations
quite a lot of money and thus uh they
have a lot of security in mind uh if you
look at the news uh in BBC News there
was something reported from a French
police that there was a virus that
infected more under 850 000 computers
worldwide now on the similar lines if
you remember ransomware's and if you
look at Wanna Cry that happened in 2018
or 2017 it also cost the world 4 billion
dollars in losses during that just one
small month of its infection then Apple
Google basically disclosed that a large
scale hacking effort was targeted at
Apple devices and this has been it has
reported that there was a sustained
effort to hack iPhones over a period of
at least two years which means that
there's a specific Target towards Apple
consumers and they are at a higher risk
of getting hacked than others then the
Texas government organizations hit by
that somewhere attack so hackers have
infected 23 organizations connected to
local government in the U.S state of
Texas with ransomware that means that
their databases have been encrypted the
government themselves do not have access
to that database the databases could
have been compromised by the hackers and
that means that whatever Services were
being provided to the users based on
that database May no longer be available
to the end users because of the
ransomware now moving on with these why
won't do we want to become a certified
ethical hacker increase attacks lead to
more job openings now if you look at
ransomware the wannacry attack that
happened in 2017 there was a knee-jerk
reaction given by the rest of the world
for it security suddenly budgets or
started opening up Suddenly people
wanted more ethical hackers on their
payrolls to test for vulnerabilities in
UK and Europe we have gdpr which is
again another law that imposes CVO
penalties on organizations that get
hacked and for not having proper
security and our assessment and
penetration testing program in place so
that leads to a lot of job requirements
as well where organizations look at
people with this special skill set to
help them mitigate the vulnerabilities
to keep to safeguard them and their
customers from hackers and also from
penalties from law enforcement and
governments so does the demand keeps on
increasing for ethical hackers which
automatically means that the salaries
are going to increase as well so more
the demand lesser the supply higher the
salaries that's plain economics then
challenge hacker with malicious intent
so from ethical hackers perspective it
is our duty to safeguard an organization
which means that will be pitched against
hackers and we have to ensure that those
hackers would be challenged to the
maximum limit before they even try to
get access to any of the resources that
we are trying to protect it offers a
boost in your career so more uh efforts
that you put in more vulnerabilities
that you find the better the career
prospects that you have and the better
job aspect that you're going to get and
this also lets you keep yourself updated
on the latest technology as the
technology progresses as we evolve on
technology Security will also evolve and
the ethical hacker would need to keep
themselves updated on these Technologies
so this is what is a plus point to
become a certified ethical hacker now
let's look at the exam that you might
have to give for the CH version 10
certification so ceh stands for
certified ethical hacker the current
version is version 10 uh like in this
case there are two different exams one
is a written exam and when we say
written you don't have to actually write
something down it's a multiple choice
question so you'll be asked a question
you'll be given four options you have to
choose the correct option according to
your knowledge and then you will be
judged whether the answer is correct or
not the governing body who issues this
certification is known as EC Council
which is a globally well accepted
Authority exam has 125 questions and the
minimum passing question is around 60 to
85 percent now there are no marks per se
as such but the grading happens on a
percentile methodology so the scoring is
set by using statistical analysis and
the scoring changes based on the
difficulty of the questions that you're
being asked so if the questions are less
difficult your passing rate is going to
be 85 percent out of a possible 100
percent and if the questions are going
to be difficult then it may be around 60
percent so it may vary a little bit so
I've seen people clear at 73 percent I
have seen people flunk at 75 percent
based on the questions being asked so
the questions are asked you answer them
and the results are out immediately so
once you submit the exam the exam tells
you how you have paid in uh in the exam
and whether you have cleared or not in
the Practical exam there are 20
practical challenges that are given to
you with real world scenarios so this is
where you start executing those aspects
and so they basically would let's say
give you a basic uh challenge saying you
know what you're in a subnet you're
using Kali Linux or using a particular
software and you have to scan and
identify the live machines that are
there in that particular subnet and then
you try to do icmp paying it may not
work you may you might want to do a
different sort of things to identify if
the information that you're collecting
is correct and then you create a report
and submit that so in this scenario uh
you basically exhaust all the
possibilities that you tried that you
have learned about and then analyze the
response that you've given and then you
create a report about uh which live
machines were there and if that is
correct you would be clearing that exam
now here again uh we are talking about
I'll just give you an example about what
those practical exams would be like but
expect something Advanced as well
whether they have given you an
application and you want to do a SQL
injection attack and they want you to
identify those vulnerabilities test
those vulnerabilities and create a
report on what you have attempted what
was the response that you have created
and so on so forth so if it is a
hackable application they would expect
you to go through the entire exercise
and give out the report now the report
comes with screenshots and proof that
you've actually executed that as well
right in this exam there would be 70
passing that is required to clear the
Practical exam so if you look at it the
theoretical exam would test you on your
intellect to see how much knowledge you
have about Technologies about scenarios
and how you're going to conduct the
ethical hacking test also with the
effectiveness of which tools you're
going to utilize the Practical one would
be where you're going to execute those
tests and you're going to create a
report the exam fee for either or we
won't be giving both of them together so
it's either or each exam would cost you
around 500 from the EC council's website
the exam duration for the return exam is
four hours uh the types of questions
that will be asked to you are multiple
choice questions so they'll give you a
scenario a question and then there would
be four options which you need to choose
from to identify which is the correct
answer and you'll have 125 such
questions that you need to answer within
four hours now four hours is 240 minutes
so we assume that 240 minutes and we got
125 questions so we've got a lot of time
however the questions are scenario based
are quite lengthy you have to read the
question understand analyze the question
analyze the answer and then try to try
to give the correct answer so here the
more knowledge that you have the more
Hands-On knowledge that you have the
more analytical mind you're going to
develop right so this would require a
lot of practice as well you cannot just
read a few documents and say you've
become an ethical hacker and start
giving an exam so you need Hands-On even
for this exam you need to know what
exactly happens during a hack or what as
the executed command what should be the
output of it and based on that you
create a certain knowledge base in your
mind which can help you analyze these
questions and answer them the exam is
only available in the language in the
English language and it is an online
exam it is a proctored exam so you would
have a webcam watching you to ensure
that you are not cheating it is not an
open book exam leader can you use Google
so these are the aspects in which you're
going to be tested in the theoretical
exam these are the seven domains with
their percentile as far as the weightage
is concerned uh in the exam so 125
questions 23 of those questions would be
towards security 22 percent would be
networking and background information
analysis and assessment would be 12
percent ethics would be at three percent
29 would be tools systems and programs
nine percent on procedure and
methodology and two percent on
regulation and policy now let's start
with networking and information
background So when you say Network and
communication Technologies we are
talking about how networks work how
computers communicate with each other's
the IEEE 802.3 standards ethernet and so
on so forth then information security
threats and attack vectors on networks
themselves and the Technologies in the
information security so let's have a
look at a couple of questions and see
what these questions would be like so
networking and information background at
which layer of the OSI model does a
proxy operate so if you look at it you
first need to know what OSI model is the
open systems interconnect you need to
know that there are seven layers in the
OSI model and you need to know their
functionality so what happens at the
physical layer what is the network layer
what is the data link layer and what is
an application layer right and which
protocols work on which layer so at the
data link layer for example for hacking
as far as we are concerned we need to
know that the data link layer takes care
of Mac addressing the network layer
would take care of Ip addressing and
routing ports physical lab would
basically be the physical layer where
your RJ45 your network interface card
your cabling comes into the picture the
packet gets converted into electronic
pulse and gets sent over the wire the
application layer is where applications
interact with each other using some
different protocols So when you say a
proxy a proxy generally operates at the
application layer it allows an
application to connect so this is some
knowledge that we need to understand we
need to analyze now again this is a
basic question is an example question in
your exam it's not going to be as
straightforward as just a single line
question there would be a few but not
many so let's move on to the next one
which of these protocols is a connection
oriented protocol so we're looking at
FTP UDP TCP and POP3 now here we need to
understand what these Protocols are all
about and which protocol works at which
layer and when we say connection
oriented protocol what exactly does that
mean so when you say connection oriented
protocol as far as this question is
concerned we are looking at two
protocols TCP and UDP which work at the
transport layer of the OSI model and TCP
stands for transmission control protocol
UDP stands for user datagram protocol we
need to remember that TCP is a reliable
protocol it is used for reliability
cause and to ensure that the data has
been transmitted and has been received
correctly does the reliability which
makes it a connection oriented protocol
UDP or user datagram protocol is a
connection less protocol which means
that there are no established sessions
that the protocol is going to maintain
and it's just going to dump data So when
you say connection oriented protocol TCP
will maintain sessions with the end
points and regular data coming in and
going through those sessions for that
particular session that's going on right
and that's the knowledge that would have
to evolve with and develop as far as CH
is concerned so the correct answer here
is TCP the connection oriented protocol
then let's look at the next domain let's
talk about analysis and assessment so
information security assessment and
Analysis and looking at information
security assessment processes what kind
of database is used in addition to
relational database now that's a
confusing question right they are
talking about what kind for database is
used in addition to relational database
I have seen users getting confused where
they say what kind of database is used
in relational database and they start
arguing the question may not be correct
and this is where those certain keywords
that we need to identify in the exam in
the questions in that exam come into the
picture so they're talking about apart
from relational databases what other
kind of databases are there and they
have given you four options I
hierarchical databases SQL databases
odbc databases and structured databases
now this is where the knowledge comes
into the picture where we know the types
of databases SQL or structured query
language is basically a language that is
used to interact with relational
databases odbcs are drivers that allow
applications to connect to databases and
relational database is a structured
database so the only option that is left
is an hierarchical database which is a
kind of database apart from a relational
database there can be some similarities
over here but this is what the question
is about the types of databases so if
you look at it you can change this to in
addition to relational databases there
are also what kind of databases and the
answer to that would be a hierarchical
database then the next question Dash is
used to audit databases so when you go
to audit databases there would be a lot
of tools out there but we need to
restrict ourselves to the four options
that have been given here ping ipconfig
trace route and SQL ping now ping is an
icmp ping that is that is utilized by
administrators to look at connectivity
between two devices ipconfig reveals the
information of the IP configuration of
that particular device traced route
allows you to trace how a packet is
going to travel from one point to the
end point and SQL ping is the utility
that is used to audit databases and
that's the correct answer so out of the
four options which is the most
appropriate answer somebody who would
argue that even ping can be utilized to
look at auditing databases which would
give us the connectivity between the
database server and the application
server true but that's the connectivity
that's the network based connectivity
between the two devices a SQL ping would
actually ping to that database and see
if the database is responding or not now
let's look at the next domain ethics
ethics of information security
information security policies laws and
act there would be as few Acts or laws
that would be covered in the training as
far as the exam is concerned for now
let's just look at which of the
following prerequisites does an ethical
hacker requires to start evaluating a
system so if I structure this question
what is the expected thing that I want
out of the activity I want to start
evaluating a system and they're asking
me what are the prerequisites that a
ethical hacker requires for that
activity to happen so is it a training
is it permissions is it planning or is
it nothing now nothing cannot be an
answer right if I want to evaluate a
system and have nothing that's not going
to help me so training training is a
prerequisite but but it is a
prerequisite to become an ethical hacker
not to start evaluating the system
planning planning is a stage that you go
through when you're an ethical hacker
where you look at how you can evaluate a
system and then you've got permissions
without permissions you cannot start a
planning exercise because if you plan to
hack something without permission that
means you're not an ethical hacker you
are a hacker so the key word again what
does an ethical hacker requires a
prerequisite to start evaluating the
system so planning is out of the
question because planning comes at a
later phase you have been trained so
what is the most probable answer over
here permission which is correct because
without permission I as a ethical hacker
cannot start evaluating the system what
is a Code of Ethics so when we say code
of ethics what would it translate into
is it a law for expected behavior from
an ethical hacker is it a corporate
policy that is created by Organization
for a ethical hacker is it a description
of expected Behavior or is it a standard
for civil conduct now it cannot be a
corporate policy because corporate
policies differ so if I go into one
organization I cannot have a different
code of ethics from another organization
that I'm working in it has to be
standardized it has to be consistent it
is not a law because it is not
implemented by a government it is not a
standard for civil conduct because again
there is no government standards coming
into the picture so the most appropriate
answer here is it is a description of
expected Behavior a behavior that is
expected from an ethical hacker that
they need to adhere to so for example if
I come across a vulnerability with the
expected behavior from me is that I
report that vulnerability to the
organization and I do not keep it aside
with the malicious intent to misuse it
later on so the code of ethics will
basically describe what would be an
acceptable behavior from an ethical
hacker once they have started exercising
their rights or start executing their
jobs then looking at tools systems and
programs so information system security
systems will not talking about
Information Security Programs and tools
that would be utilized for ethical
hacking now it is important that you
have Hands-On on these tools as well
even if this is a theoretical exam
because we want to know what kind of
commands are used by these tools what is
the output of that command how we can
analyze that command to reach a
conclusion because in the exam you're
going to be straightforward asked about
the conclusion at this point so what
does hashing Preserve in a relation to
data Maybe in a practical exam they
would ask you how to Hash data and then
you have the expertise you hash that
data and you provide the hashing
mechanisms they might give you a
curveball saying we want to use a
particular hashing algorithm and we want
it in a particular Manner and then we
want to store it in a certain way in a
theoretical exam they're just going to
ask you about the concept what does it
achieve what does hashing Preserve of in
relation to data what is hashing used
for was it confidentiality repudiation
availability and integrity so we first
need to know the definitions the
technical definitions of all four from
ethical hackers perspective
confidentiality means that the data
needs to be available to authorized
users as and when they require it
repudiation is the non-deniability of a
transaction being happened and all the
parties being held responsible for the
transaction availability is the
availability of that data when somebody
wants to access it and integrity is the
trustworthiness of that data which
ensures the person who's authorized to
access it that the data has not been
tampered with and has not been
manipulated by any unauthorized activity
and that is where your integrity
verification comes in so when we say
hashing preserves what hashing is
basically used as an exercise to
preserve the Integrity of that data that
means the trustworthiness of that data
then moving on to the next question
which one of the following is an example
of a server-side scripting language so
we know that JavaScript is a scripting
language you know PHP is a scripting
language structured query language SQL
used for databases and HTML hypertext
markup language that is used for your
websites now which of this is server
side and which of this is client-side so
SQL is used for databases at the server
side of the application converts that
language but it's not a scripting
language HTML is again not a scripting
language so there are only two scripting
languages over here JavaScript and PHP
JavaScript is a client-side scripting
language PHP is a server-side scripting
language that's the answer to this
question would be PHP then moving on to
the next domain let's talk about
procedures and methodology from our
information security procedure
standpoint and as a information security
assessment methodology so the first
question here symmetry cryptography is
also known as what so the Assumption of
this question is we know what
cryptography is all about and we know
the types of cryptography so there is
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography a
symmetric cryptography is basically
using the same key to encrypt and
decrypt and a symmetric is using public
key to encrypt and a private key to
decrypt so if you are using the same key
to encrypt and decrypt that means that
this is known as a shared key
cryptography where you're sharing the
key with the intended user so that they
can use the same key to decrypt it then
you've got asymmetric encryption so an
asymmetric encryption is also referred
to as which kind of a following shared
key public key hashing key or block key
so based on the topic that we have
discussed and what you would learn in
the ethical hacking perspective you will
know that this is also known as a public
key methodology moving on to the next
one talking about security information
security controls information security
attack detections so the first question
physical security can prevent which of
the following so first and foremost from
ethical hackers perspective the first
confusion comes in would ethical hacker
be responsible for physical security and
the answer to that is yes why because if
there is a firewall on a server but the
server can physically be accessed by a
hacker and they can input a USB device
in it which may have a Trojan or a virus
or something like that that's going to
circumvent any of the firewalls that you
have placed on the system so so physical
security is an important part of ethical
hacking as well and we need to know what
part of physical security mechanisms can
be implemented from a hacker's
perspective so the four options that we
have given is a DDOS attack FTP
tailgating or cracking cracking is
password cracking FTP is a protocol DDOS
is a voluminous attack based on traffic
that is created and tailgating is
actually a person killing a person in to
an organization so that is where the
physical security comes in and
tailgating is the activity like I said
where a person till gets another person
and uh basically let's say there's a
there's an authorized person who's who
has the authority to access a particular
server room they swipe their swipe card
on a lock open the door and walk in but
they do not close the door behind them
and while the door is open another
person sneaks in without the knowledge
of the first person and does a
tailgating attack happens so physical
security at that point in time can
prevent tailgating whereas you can say
instead of the swipe lock or up apart
from the swipe block you may have a
guard over there or a CCTV camera over
there who is going to monitor something
which of the following is a good defense
against tailgating and picky backing so
we've just discussed what tailgating is
piggybacking is another exercise where a
person would ask would impersonate
someone and ask assistants to get access
to a particular resource so that they
can conduct their job now in this
scenario camera would make no difference
because a camera is basically a
detective mechanism it is going to
detect information and if you're
monitoring it well and good if not then
it wouldn't work guards it is easy to
fool guards turn Styles turn styles are
those devices where you put in a coin
and there are three extensions to it it
revolves around and allows one person to
go through but they are easily bypassed
Man Trap is a scenario where there are
two doors the first door opens there's a
ccdb camera monitoring everything there
are other security mechanisms coming in
the first door closes until then you
have to identify yourself for the second
door to open again till the first door
closes the second door cannot open so
you are trapped in between those if you
don't have proper authentication for the
second door even if you do a tailgating
or a piggyback attack on the first door
you will not be able to bypass the
second door thus the answer to this
question would be man traps now those
are the examples of questions that you
may be asked or the types of questions
that you may be asked in your exam and
you can see that these are quite
descriptive questions if you will the
description the Assumption being the
knowledge that is required where you
understand all the options that have
been given to you identify the keywords
in the question map them accordingly and
then try to identify the most
appropriate answer that has been given
in that particular options menu so this
calls upon a lot of intellect it calls
upon a strong analytical mind that in
very small amount of time can analyze
the question come and reduce to the
reduce the correct answer and then move
on to the next question understand 240
minutes for 125 questions if you go back
and see how much time we have spent in
just touching base on each of the option
and just identifying what it means you
would basically then realize how much
time it would take for your brain to
analyze crunch all of that and come to
the conclusion so it takes a lot of
practice then let's move on to job roles
that are going to be possible once you
become a certified ethical hacker first
and foremost there would be a network
security analyst this job will involve
taking out weaknesses in your
infrastructure and finding creative ways
to protect your company so when you say
Network you talk about switches you're
talking about routers you're talking
about firewalls utms idss ipss and
that's all the knowledge that you'll
have to develop to understand how
networks work how Communications work so
we started off with the OSI layer we
then we need to understand which uh how
many layers are there what layers these
uh what protocols work across these
layers and so on so forth and then we
need to understand how routing is done
how the data packet is crafted how a
hacker would create a malicious data
packet what kind of attacks are possible
on those Network Works based on the
protocols the data package and the
inputs that have been allowed and thus
you your job would be to identify the
weaknesses of the current configuration
and then tweak that configuration to
prevent those attacks from happening
then there is a security specialist this
protect local state and federal
infrastructure in the event of a
disaster or terrorist attack so this
would be a government job where you are
looking at government infrastructure and
critical infrastructure from the
government perspective we are going to
secure that infrastructure then a
penetration tester what is the
difference between here the penetration
tester is basically a specialist who
knows how to hack and their specialty is
just creating those attacks to see if
there are if those vulnerabilities that
may have been identified can be
penetrated can be misused can be
bypassed can be anything right so here
you're going to attempt to breach a
computer via a network vulnerability or
an application vulnerability or a host
based vulnerability and try to get
access to unauthorized information then
an ID auditor an auditor is responsible
for the internal controls and managing
risks to a company's technology Network
now the first thing is even if I've
implemented a firewall I need to audit
the firewall for the effectiveness of
that firewall and I need to do it on a
continuous basis because if I create one
firewall today 10 days down the line the
firewall may not be as effective because
of the ever-changing scope of
Information Technology New Ports being
opened up old ports being closed down
the firewall rules keep on changing
there are requests coming in from
employees for different permissions to
be allowed or to be for restrictions to
be implemented and thus an auditor needs
to be in place where they're going to
audit all of the security mechanisms
that we have in place and ensure that
they are effective enough and then
there's a security Engineers job role as
well where they are supposed to set up
security measures to monitor protect
data and systems from hackers and cyber
attacks so this is the defensive
mechanism where where it comes in where
you identify where firewalls can be
placed what kind of firewalls can be
placed how to configure them and secure
the infrastructure most of the
organizations in today's world that are
IIT organizations or ID dependent
organizations or it enabled
organizations whichever way you look at
it any organizations that uses
information technology for their
business to be executed will be looking
for certified ethical hackers to audit
to penetrate to test or to secure that
infrastructure all right so there would
be multiple job rules and these are some
of the organizations on the screen that
you see that hire ethical hackers most
of your major organizations like Google
Facebook Apple Dell all of these
organizations have a very robust
security teams and they are on the watch
out for ethical hackers on a regular
basis so once hired what is the salary
of ethical hacker like what would you
expect so in U.S the pay scale now this
is a source from payscale.com and the
payscale photo certified ethical hacker
it would be around 70 000 odd US dollars
per annum in India it would be five and
a half lakh rupees per annum and it
starts from there so it can move on to
depending on the experience that you
have depending on the knowledge that you
have depending on the achievements that
you have achieved during your career the
salary should Skyrocket this is the
average salary that is paid for a ceh in
the US and in India ethical hacking has
found its place among the most lucrative
Industries in the world for budding
professionals recent Trends side effects
of a global pandemic and cyber security
statistics reveal a huge increase in
hacked and breach data from increasingly
common sources in the works place these
can be mobile phones iot devices among
other things
on top of this covid-19 has stamped up
remote workforces making inroads for
cyber attacks
this kind of growth would not have been
possible if not for several Reliable
Tools and services
from scripts that can find intricate
details of companies the softwares that
can Brute Force servers with a single
command today's lesson is about a tool
that can gather information about as
many exploits as possible for a
vulnerable system
Metasploit has been a staple in the
ethical hacking industry for decades and
we will learn how Metasploit functions
as an exploit chain
the metasplot framework is a very
powerful tool that can be used by cyber
criminals as well as ethical hackers to
probe systemic vulnerabilities on
networks and servers because it's an
open source framework it can be easily
customized and used with most operating
systems
with Metasploit the ethical hacking team
can use ready-made or custom code while
introducing it into a network to probe
for weak spots as another flavor of
threat hunting once these flaws are
identified and documented the
information can be used to address
systemic weaknesses and prioritize
Solutions
once a particular vulnerability is
identified and the necessary exploit is
fed into the system there are a host of
options for the hacker depending on the
vulnerability hackers can even run root
commands from the terminal allowing
complete control over the activities of
the compromise system as well as all
personal data stored on the device
a big advantage of Metasploit is the
ability to run full-fledged scans on a
Target system giving a detailed picture
of the security index of set system this
also lists the necessary exploits that
can be used to bypass the firewalls and
the antivirus software
having a single solution to gather
almost all the necessary points of
attack is very useful for ethical
hackers and penetration testers as well
now let's use the Metasploit tool to
break into a Windows 10 machine and
Garner root access or the administrator
privileges of the system
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1 000 Plus hours of
video content for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
next we have to learn about what is
metasploying
the Metasploit project is a computer
security project that provides
information about security
vulnerabilities and AIDS in penetration
testing and IDs development
we can open up the terminal here
we're going to allow root access
and to open up Metasploit the keyword is
msf console
it's going to take a little bit of time
to start it up
now the Metasploit console has been
loaded
from here we can decide what type of
attack we want to launch and what kind
of exploits we can launch against
vulnerable targets
for example like we already discussed
I'm running this virtual machine on a
Windows 10 host machine so if I open the
command prompt from my Windows 10 over
here
if I need to check the IP address once I
go with ipconfig
here you can see the IP address of this
local machine
moving on
if we have to attack that machine let's
say we want to see what kind of exploits
are going to work over there
now we already know that Windows has
some common vulnerabilities one of those
vulnerabilities is the HTA server
vulnerability HTA is supposed to be a
HTML application but when past the right
payload it can be used to open a back
door into a system
to start off with the Metasploit and
accessing such applications
we're going to use the command use
exploit and the name of the reverse HTA
server is this windows
for miscellaneous
HDA server
as you can see it already found this one
all right now there are some options
that we need to set for this exploit to
go through for example you can see some
of the options over here there is the
payload the payload is supposed to be
the malicious file that we are going to
send on the HTML application which
allows us to give the back door
for example right now the payload which
is the malicious file is a Windows meter
printer reverse TCP
completely understandable now let's set
the L host
L host and R host and SRV host should be
the one where we are going to launch the
attack from for example if we launched
another tab of this console
and we just press i f config
the IP address is 192 plus 168 72 130.
so we're going to set the L host as
192.168.72.130
and we're going to do the same thing
with SRV host
yeah
we're going to set a port
where we need to capture the back door
axis
next the payload has already been set
this payload will launch a back door and
give us meter printer access to the
system meter printer is can be
considered as an upgrade of a normal
command prompt shell
we will look into it once we get the
access in the first place
now that we have set the commands we can
press on exploit and press enter
now you can see we have a URL over here
we're going to copy this URL
once the URL is copied we take it into
the browser and paste it
this will ask us to download this file
now as per browser security settings
this file should be blocked by default
we can decide to keep it and with the
correct formulation of this malicious
package even the website browser
antivirus softwares will not be able to
detect good payloads we're going to save
this file
and we're going to open it
publisher could not be verified if we
press run
and we go back to our meter beta access
over here
you can see it has already captured a
URL of an HD server and it is writing
delivering payload
just have to wait for a few seconds so
the payload is delivered
it has sent this much amount of data
meter Peter session one is opened
and we should get the access soon
there we go now to understand where is
the session set
we can write sessions minus I
as you can see it has a meter beta over
here we're going to write sessions minus
I
recession ID is one so we're going to
write one and we have the meter beta
access now to get a fair idea of the
system
we're going to write Source info and
it's going to the computer name the OS
architecture all these things we can
write the help command to see what are
the things that we can get out of the
system we can take screenshots we can
control the webcam and start a video
chat
we can take a lot of things over here
there are other commands as well where
we can change the file directory like
the cat command CD command there are so
many things that work in the normal CMD
which we can run on the meter beta as
well now if you want to access this
command prompt of the system directly we
can go with this we have to write shell
and there we go we are in the downloads
folder right now to see if this is the
same computer or not we're going to
write ipconfig
as you can see it is our victim machine
with 192.168 or 29.171 we can just press
exit and we're back with the meter beta
access
this is how we can use metafreter and
Metasploit to gain access to a Windows
10 machine
next let's take a look at how we can get
to root access from a Windows 10 system
we just learned how we can get a meter
beta access from a system
we can background this meter Builder
session by writing background and
pressing enter
we can still see the shares sessions
minus I it's still present over here
now
these kind of access are not
administrative axis these are the kind
of back doors that can be created for
standard users but to get a complete
access of a system including the program
files the windows documents we need to
have root access or administrative
access
through that we're going to use another
exploit
reminder that the meter beta session of
the standard access is already present
and we're not messing with it right now
we're going to set up another session
albeit with the same machine
that exploit name is
use exploit windows
local
bypass USC
Event Viewer
and there we go now if we check the
options that we can put in the system
we have to choose an exploit Target
we need to put a session as well
let's say we going to use the session
one this is the session that has the
meter beta access with the standard user
it doesn't have the system user
we're going to write
set Session One
and we're going to run export
it's going to run a few commands and it
opened a second meter beta session
as you can see it is the session two
if I write this info
you can still see I'm not the system
user right now I'm still just a normal
user how can we check that
if you go to Shell
consider CC users cannot be downloads
all these things
if I press exit
go back to the meter bitter there is a
command on meter beta get system it
attempts to elevate your privilege to
that of the local system which basically
means you get promoted into root access
so if we write get system
and due to pipe impersonation we now
have the system root access
as you can see now it has become x64 and
we are the admin users now if I go to
Shell
I can easily go back
windows
and I can easily access these ones this
kind of control over the windows folders
and the program files folders these kind
of things are not possible if you are
not an admin access or the command
prompt has not been run with admin
permissions this is how we can use
privilege escalation to get into an
admin access system
we use the second exploit which was the
bypass us Event Viewer exploit
and essentially used it with the first
session as you can read here Windows
escalation USA protection bypass
it was first disclosed on 2016 but it
still works on some systems
this is how we can get a root access on
a Windows 10 installation
we have the Kali Linux operating system
booted up over here uh what we are going
to do is we are going to open up a tool
called set social engineering toolkit
which you would find in this option and
that's the tools that we want it's a
command line tool a menu driven tool we
are going to host a fake Facebook page
and you can see how we can Harvest
credentials by this kind of an attack so
these are some disclaimers you might
want to go through that do you want to
agree to the terms of service yes press
enter and that's your social engineering
toolkit and we are talking about a
phishing attack which can comes under
the social engineering attack so it like
I said it's a menu driven tool so we
just have to look at these options and
then just type in the number of the
option that we want so we want to do a
social engineering attack so I type in
one press enter in that it is asking me
whether I want a spear phishing attack a
website attack Vector we are going to
choose a second option so I type in two
press enter and then it asks me what I
want to do I want take the third option
here credential Harvester attack
methodology and we want to do the third
attack now it is asking whether we want
to use the in-house website templates
that it already has or do we want to
clone a site or do we have a customized
site that we have prepared that we want
to migrate into this tool we are going
to do the site cloning option so we're
going to type in two press enter and
then it is going to ask me the IP
address where it wants to capture and
store the credentials by default this is
the IP address that I'm using so if I
leave it blank it will take my default
IP address so I'm just going to press
enter and now it is asking me the URL to
clone so I type in HTTPS
www.facebook.com what it is going to do
it is going to correct online and it is
now because it has clone the website
Facebook login.php the best way to use
this attack is that you if you use the
if the username and password form are in
the same field or the same page
regardless this capture is all posts on
a website so you may need to copy www
star into HTML depending on where your
directory structure is press return if
you understand what we are seeing here
so press enter the social engine toolkit
credential Harvest attack is running on
Port 80 information will be displayed to
you as it arrives so the site was 71.134
right the default IP address and this is
where the website is being hosted let's
check that out so let me open up a
browser on my host machine and let me
point it to the Kali Linux machine that
we have just created
192.168.71.134 and you should see a
login to Facebook coming up right here
looks genuine it is genuine because we
just went online and downloaded this
let's just have a recap let's have a
explanation of what we are trying to do
I am trying to host fake Facebook page
on my server which has an embedded
script in it which is going to do
credential harvesting so the attack here
is let's say if I have now hosted this I
can craft a fake email send it across to
a victim saying uh your Facebook account
has seen some unforeseen activity create
a hyperlink using HTML coding within
that click here to access your account
and verify uh that the account is
secured and when they click on that link
they will be redirected to my fake page
which is here you can see the IP
addresses my virtual machines IP address
but I'm seeing a Facebook login page and
I'm going to type in someone at
somewhere.com and the password I'm just
going to type in the regular ones that I
use and if you see it when we typed in
the username and password the page just
refreshed and gave us the login page
again but now if you look at the URL I'm
actually on Facebook's login page which
is exactly the same that I was hosting
so a Lehman wouldn't probably figure out
they've been hacked by now they just
would figure out okay they probably
typed in the incorrect password and the
page refresh or something like that and
they're just going to log in and they're
actually going to access the Facebook
page thus they might not even realize
that something went wrong but if I go
back to my virtual machine you can see
that it has captured some data and it is
reporting over here of what has happened
so if I just scroll up let's see what
happened here and if you have been able
to capture anything so we got a hit
printing the output this does the HTTP
1.1 200 okay response coming in password
field phone and we're just looking there
it is email someone at somewhere.com and
password that I typed in ASD at the rate
one two three four so it has captured
the username and the password right here
uh once you're done I mean this is the
way attackers work now this is a very
basic attack again uh in the actual
trainings you would then look at how you
would Host this on a real website make
it a global attack right now it's a
virtual machine with a class CIP address
so here the thought processors where can
we get a free hosting where we can host
this kind of sites maybe I'll have to
purchase a domain which looks like
similar to Facebook or the victim that
I'm trying to attack so this is just a
POC so we just wanted to find out if we
can how phishing is done and this is
exactly how it is done right so pressing
Ctrl C would exit this tool and takes
you back to the actual menu press 99 99
to exit and there it is close the two
window and that's the fishing practical
after phishing let's talk about SQL
injection SQL injection stands for uh
structured query language injection
which is a database attack though it
resides within the application so it's
the application vulnerability that we
are trying to look at to try to bypass
authentication as the name suggests a
SQL injection vulnerability allows an
attacker to inject malicious input into
a SQL statement what is a SQL statement
a query that is used by an application
and is fired off to the database
database executes that query gets that
information that is required and sends
it back to the user if the user is
authenticated so we're going to look at
the SQL injection attack demo here and
what we are going to do is we are going
to go back to our VMware Workstation and
I've got a tool over here called ovast
broken web application which is a
utility that has been created for people
like us to test our skills to learn on
how we can develop our skills further so
this has a lot of vulnerable
applications built within it we're just
going to try to access it and we are
going to see if we can create a SQL
injection attack just waiting for it to
boot up once it boots up it will give us
an IP address there we are so we need to
connect to 71.132 so I can just use the
same browser I was using close up
Facebook and now go to 192 168
71.132 and this is the ovasp broken web
application project uh what we're going
to do is we're going to go to utility
day and this is a application that has a
lot of information within it you can see
it gives you links about what you should
do help me video tutorials listing of
one that they have and so on so forth so
you can see we are not logged in right
now I'm just going to do this as a demo
so what we're going to do is we're going
to look at this and bypass
authentication so we are taken to the
login page where you need a username and
password to log in I'm going to type in
test as the username and test as the
password click on login and you can see
that account does not exist so the
authentication mechanism works now what
we want to do is we want to create a
query now what does a query look like
when I type in a username and a password
if I just type in a single port here it
is going to create an error and this is
what a SQL query looks like select
username from account where username is
a single quote and then the exception
error happens so it's not showing the
rest of the query to us what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to craft a query
here a single quote and give it a
condition or one equals one space hyphen
hyphen space What Happens hyphen hyphen
space is comments out anything after
that so the password field is being
commented out at this point in time and
I'm just giving it a condition where the
condition is true 1 does equal 1 and if
this condition is true it is going to
allow me to log in so you can see right
now you're not logged in this bypasses
the authentication mechanism and you can
see user authenticated and we are now
logged in as admin so in the training
what we need to understand as a whole is
how SQL Works what are the queries that
are structured with how you can what are
the testing operators now the single
code that we used that was an operator
in the SQL syntax what these operators
are how they function and then how we
can leverage these attacks there are
different tools that are given to you in
Kali as well that you can utilize so in
Kali Linux you can just open up a
command prompt and there's a tool called
SQL map you need to give it a particular
site so SQL map hyphen U for the URL and
whatever the URL is now URL here and
then once you're here you just press the
enter key this tool will craft all the
queries in the background for you you
don't even have to no SQL query or sorry
equal languages this is a very easy tool
to utilize sadly I cannot demo this on a
live website because that would be
illegal but you can see how you can
operate this yourself that's what uh SQL
injections are all about moving on we
now talk about uh vpns virtual private
networks and a virtual private network
is basically a secure network that
allows me to anonymize myself over the
Internet so what I'm doing is I'm
connecting from here to a server that
encrypts my channel encrypts my
connection and thus allows me to keep my
data secure now the basic essence of a
VPN or a virtual private network is to
allow me this encryption mechanism where
I can encrypt and Safeguard my data the
added advantage that nowadays a VPN
gives is that they can allow us to spoof
our IP address or obfuscate our IP
address so we can actually become
Anonymous on the internet it can allow
us to use multiple IP addresses and thus
secure ourselves on the internet for
example people I use VPN called
cyberghost and what this allows me to do
is it allows me so many servers over
here if you look at the entire list all
the servers then there are no spy
servers which can guarantee me that they
are not going to keep and store any logs
and thus they are not going to record
any of the activity that I'm doing right
since they are located out of Romania
this becomes a little bit more safer for
me because the government and the laws
over there are a little bit more relaxed
than other countries uh they give me
different links for torrenting for
streaming for connection feature so
there are a lot of vpns out there so for
example let's go to the website
cyberghost.com so you can see there's a
sale going on 76 percent sale or you can
go on to
expressvpn which is also a very good VPN
then there is not VPN it depends on what
you want and how you want to utilize it
so just purchasing a VPN or getting a
free free VPN is not enough it depends
on which country the VPN originates from
and which server you're connected to for
example most of the countries have a
pact where they share information
amongst themselves even if you're
connected to a VPN that means that these
companies that provide these Services
have to generate and store logs and
these logs have to be reported to the
government if they ask for it now if
there's a list of 14 countries that
actually focuses on this practice so you
have to find out VPN that and a server
that is not a part of those 14 countries
and ensure that those logs are not going
to be reported to the government and
these are three vpns basically are
something that which are good and I
personally use cyberghost I have used
others I just keep on rotating them just
to get an idea of which one is better so
these are vpns that you can allow you to
anonymize yourself on the internet
moving on uh these are the ones that we
talked about other safer VPN hide my ass
expressvpn and so on so forth from our
terminologies let's now talk about VPS
uh VPS is basically virtual private
server where you can rent a service or
server as a service a virtual machine as
a service so basically on a cloud using
infrastructure as a service you can rent
a server and utilize it for whatever
activity you want so let's go to these
sites register.com God ID Network
Solutions or we can talk about other
Cloud Solutions as well so here you can
get register your domain names uh so in
the previous exercise for let's say when
we talked about the phishing exercise
what we want is we can go on to
register.com or we can go on to
godaddy.com and we can purchase a
particular domain for example something
like this instead of the OS I'm typing
in a couple of zeros for the Facebook
and see let's see if anything of that is
available now something dot photo is
available or facetips.com is available
uh there are other options that I'm
making over here that that they're
giving us over here and once we purchase
this we can then have our own hosting uh
with a web hosting as a service and we
can have a Linux based hosting or a
Windows based hosting depending on what
you want and that's where your shared
hosting comes with the picture if you
just want uh if you want to look at a
virtual server and you want to rent a
server over there itself you can move on
to rackspace.com and here in your
services you can have physical server or
a virtual server in a public Cloud your
other Cloud providers for example would
be Amazon AWS and on AWS you can
basically look at ec2 elastic compute
Cloud which is basically virtual servers
in the cloud and over here you can rent
out a server with whatever capacity you
require you'll obviously have to pay the
rent for what those servers are going to
cost but once you have those servers you
can then launch any services on top of
it look looking at other services that
we have we talked about Tor tar is a
onion routing software that allows users
to browse the web anonymously so we can
just go online and we can try to spoof
our identity and I'm going to show you
how so I've got a VMware Workstation
right here the one so we're just going
to pull that up and we're going to power
on a Windows 7 machine where we're going
to look at the onion routing so Windows
machine has booted up we're just going
to log in and this is my Windows 7
machine now I've got a Chrome browser
right here and we're going to go to a
website called see myip.com which is
going to give the IP address that I'm
currently using so right now I'm not on
connected to any VPN or anything and you
can see that's my IP address that I'm
utilizing now if I want to anonymize
myself what I'm going to do is I am
going to use Tor and that's the tower
browser that's set up right there if I
click on it it's going to open up the
software and it's going to create a new
network and it's going to connect to the
tornetwork and allow me to anonymize
myself right so that's the Thor browser
opening up and giving me a new browser
over here so I've got one which is the
old one which is uh my current IP
address if I just refresh that you'll
see that I'm still on the same IP
address as far as this browser is
concerned there's a refresh and it's
still showing you the same IP address
where if I go on to power right now and
if I go to see my ip.com you will see
that it is going to give me and you can
see the amount of time it is taking to
reach that site that's because I am
using a VPN and there's a lot of
encryption running off and you can see
now I'm suddenly connected via Hong Kong
and even to reach this site what Tor
does is it gives me a proxy chain a
proxy chain is where it creates multiple
hops to hide my identity and before I
reach see my ip.com I am using three
different IP addresses over here one in
France one in Germany and one in Hong
Kong so if I do something over here to
trace back my steps to my actual IP
address the law enforcement agencies or
anyone who's going to search like a
forensic investigator would have to go
through these IP addresses before they
come back to me now it's not impossible
but the effort and time that's going to
be taken to come across three different
countries is going to be phenomenal so
it may just defeat the purpose of having
so much resources spent to identify who
did what so that's what tort does for us
all right moving on from Tor we are
going to look at Key loggers key loggers
are basically softwares that run in the
background and record all the keystrokes
of the user so if I've got a keylogger
installed right now whatever I type will
be stored in a text file for the hacker
so that they can look at it later on and
just to give you an example of that we
go back to my VMware Workstation and we
open up another Windows 7 machine I'm
going to power this on and I'm going to
close this one to them so this virtual
machine has booted up we are going to
use user One login as user one let's
close all these softwares which are not
required and once this machine is booted
up what we're going to do is I'm just is
going to open up a random websites and
see what we're doing basically there's a
keylogger that's there in the startup
that's going to record our keystrokes
and we just want to see what it actually
does now Firefox is getting updated so
let's hold on now this is the latest
version of Firefox right and you're just
going to go to let's say
facebook.com wait for the website to
open up all right let's try opening it
up again and that's facebook.com and
we're just going to type in some random
username and password somewhere someone
at somewhere.com and the password being
again ASD at the rate one two three four
five six seven eight nine zero login
obviously that login is not going to
work user probably doesn't exist or if
it does the password probably is kind of
Incorrect and uh so we're going to close
this uh we're going to let's say open up
another browser window go to another
site uh
rediff.com and then go to rediffmail try
to see same thing over here someone at
somewhere.com password
hd31234567 whatever it is don't say we
can see the combination is incorrect now
there's a key logger running in the
background and what we want is we now
want to open up the key login now it is
visible here because I've kept it
visible you can hide it in the start
menu and there's a shortcut key for you
to pull it up later on so this
completely becomes invisible and what it
can do is it basically creates a record
of whatever you have been doing so far
so you can see these things populating
on the 25th of December so if I look at
the visited website you can see I open
up Mozilla Firefox the first where it uh
there was a problem loading the page
then we opened up Facebook then we open
up rediffmail.com and so on so forth so
this it just gives me the list of
visited websites whereas if I look at
Key stocks and clipboard you will see
whatever we have typed in so we first
type in facebook.com then again uh the
second time I try try to type in then I
hit backspace then I type in
facebook.com and then you can see I
typed in someone at somewhere.com and in
tab AST at the rate one two three four
five six seven eight nine zero we closed
up the browser we opened up a new one
and we went on to rediffmail.com and
then you can see me typing this one then
going back one space then the rest of
what I typed and then the password
coming in so that's what a keylogger
does if you look at the taskbar it's not
going to show you a keylogger running in
the background it's in processes you're
not going to see anything at all but
it's going to mask itself as a service
so if you look into the properties you
can see that icon coming in over here
which matches this one and so you can
see that this masking itself as a
service.exe if this gets hidden as well
it would be very difficult for a user to
even identify this all right so that's
what a keylogger is moving on let's see
what else we want to talk about so we've
talked about or we have talked about
keyloggers and now we want to talk about
firewalls now for keyloggers to be
prevented we need and the viruses right
so we might need a good antivirus
program that's going to be installed
updated and run on a regular basis to
protect ourselves from malware but what
about network connections and you need a
firewall and a system to prevent or to
detect what kind of connections are
going on in the first place now we
cannot rely on software as 100 so even
if a firewall is not configured properly
that's that's going to be a problem so
what we need to do is we have to have a
firewall configure it correctly and then
allow and this allow certain activity
from off happening and what we're going
to do is I've got such a system on my
machine here I use a software called
glass wire what it does is it is a
network analyzer so it allows me to
analyze whatever is going on you can see
all the apps that I'm utilizing and how
much upload and download they have been
doing all the traffic so you can see the
protocols that I'm utilizing so I come
to know what's going on in the
background and this gives me the entire
graph of how much I have been doing for
the past 24 hours past three hours past
five minutes and and so on and so forth
right so this is what the activities and
these are the alerts that it has been
generating I can click on those alert
and it will start telling me what it was
all about if the graph doesn't work for
me it gives me usage as well so how much
I have utilized since I've installed
this software right and what
applications have been utilized which
hosts have been connected to and the
traffic type that was utilized and then
the things on my network so these are
the devices that I have currently on my
network that has been that have been
identified and then comes the firewall
so on the firewall the firewall is
clicked on you see all those services
that have been identified and again just
click on a particular service to lock
that service so this becomes a discovery
tool identifies whatever networking is
going on gives me all that information
and then I can look at and you can just
click on any of these services that I
find it as malicious and block them I
can create different profiles for
different applications as I'm as and
when I want them and these are the
alerts so you can see that this was the
first time a network connection was
looked at from VMware and what this
allows me to do is whenever I execute a
file it can upload it to virus total.com
and scan it as a third-party antivirus
to ensure that there is nothing
malicious on it so I already have an
antivirus over here but if this ever
gets compromised I still can rely on a
third-party service where in real time
as an and when I execute my applications
uh they would be verified and I would be
assured that nothing is wrong with my
system and this software that I'm
utilizing glassware basic is free and
then there are paid versions as well it
says glasswire.com is where you're going
to find this moving on rootkit root kits
are also malicious softwares that you
allow an unauthorized user to have
access to a computer to restrict areas
of its software now a root kitchen is a
sensors which a software or malicious
software that infects a machine and
prevents a some functionality from it
like hiding data or preventing users
from running antiviruses and it's
basically a malicious software that is
used to hide information from the victim
so that they would not realize that they
have actually been compromised it's
going to be a difficult showing of a
root kit so I cannot show that demo to
you so we're just going to move on and
we are going to talk about ethical
hacking techniques now now when we say
ethical hacking techniques we want to
look at what kind of audits are
available when we want to do ethical
hacking so there's a black box audit a
white box audit and a gray box audit so
if I'm invited in an organization to
conduct a test to conduct a audit to
conduct a vulnerability assessment or a
penetration test to identify
vulnerabilities and then try to plug
them out they are going to give me three
different variations in a black box
audit they're not going to tell me about
the infrastructure they're not going to
give me any information and they want me
to start from the basics of gathering
information identifying the systems and
based on the information that I gather
whether I'm able to develop any hacks
and get compromise their infrastructure
so it will be a simulation of a hacker
who's sitting outside the organization
and trying to find a way in whereas a
white box audit is where full
infrastructure knowledge is given
anything and everything that doesn't
required for an audit is given and this
is a simulation of an Insider attack a
person sitting inside the organization
misusing their permissions and then
trying to compromise trying to get
access to data that they do not have
access to so the simulation is from a
malicious Insider a gray box is where
some partial knowledge is available and
from that partial knowledge you're going
to try to build up more information and
then you are going to try to get access
to those resources what are the tools
that we utilize so we've already had a
couple of demos on keyloggers SQL
injection SQL map and so on so forth
Metasploit is uh very much used tool for
penetration testing and having knowledge
on Metasploit is very much necessary as
far as ethical hacking is concerned nmap
this is a tool used for network
discovery necess a vulnerability scanner
Wireshark is a packet capturer that
allows you to capture packets and
analyze whatever is going on SQL map is
something that we have seen a SQL
injection attack tool which generates
its own queries and John the repair is a
password cracking tool backtrack used to
be an operating system that was utilized
for penetration testing however
backtrack has now been replaced by
something called Kali Linux and that's
the operating system that we have
utilized in all our demos where we try
to look at SQL map and those injection
attacks that we did so what are the
areas of ethical hacking we have just
talked about all these areas as well
Network Services we looked at the
glassware application that showed us how
my machine is consuming networks which
Protocols are being consumed how the
connections are being created if
somebody is able to install a Trojan on
my machine it is going to try to create
a new connection on the network with the
hacker to allow that hacker a backdoor
access now if I have that glass wire or
a similar firewall implemented it is
this wire wall that is going to detect
it and prevent that connection from
happening so if I install a software
that is suddenly suspicious or that
installs something else in the
background that I may not be aware of
that tool is going to identify all the
connections that are being made and it
is going to highlight that connection I
need to go through all of those
connections and identify whether they
are legit or not and if I find some
suspicious or doubtful I'm going to
block that connection and then I'm going
to investigate what's going on and
that's where ethical hacking comes into
the picture you want to find out if your
firewall that you have implemented is
going to work correctly or not if the
configuration of the firewall is done
properly or if the firewall is
misconfigured is it leaking out
information right at the same time
you're looking at web applications we
looked at the ovas broken web
application where we did some SQL
injection attacks right so that was a
weakness or a vulnerability in that
application which would allow us to
bypass authentication and get access to
resources that we were not authorized
for and then client-side attacks should
be where uh you install keylogger at the
end of the at the client system and then
you try to capture whatever data the
user is typing in like usernames and
passwords on the Facebook and the
redefmail.com website that we saw and
then try to misuse that information to
get access to those sources then Wi-Fi
networks right Wi-Fi is something that
we use on a regular basis we got our
smart devices nowadays smartphones
tablets phablets that we can connect to
Wi-Fi and start using all our services
our banking applications and our
smartphones and thus we want to ensure
that wireless connectivity is simple and
is secured so you want to use encryption
mechanisms you want to use tools on your
smartphones antiviruses firewalls on
your smartphones to ensure that whatever
you are utilizing is going to remain
secure and in Social Engineering we've
looked at the phishing website on
facebook.com you've seen how easy it is
to clone websites and host them on
Apache server so if you look at it as a
from ethical hackers perspective the job
of ethical hacker is to simulate these
kind of attacks that the hacker May
conduct and first of all you're
basically going to find out areas where
these attacks can happen think of it
from a hacker's perspective try to
simulate those attacks and see if those
attacks are going to be effective can
those attacks be prevented and can your
current security controls that you have
put in place identify detect and prevent
these attacks from happening in the
first place and that is what ethical
hacking is all about so why do we want
to get the certification and what would
it mean by being a CH certified uh
individual take this into consideration
you are applying for jobs and you have
been applying for cyber security related
jobs of course and you go in for an
interview in the interview you asked
quite a few questions and they will be
testing you on cyber security Concepts
so they will be asking you a lot of
technical questions about cyber security
about information security and any other
related topic so let's say in a few
minutes into the interview there are
some Concepts that you have not brushed
your skills upon and they ask you about
certifications and one of the main
certifications that is sought after is
the ceh certification and if you're not
certified that's where things can become
little bit problematic where
organizations today very proactively
start looking for people or candidates
who are already certified rather than
take them on board and get them
certified so in this scenario having a
certification would obviously help not
only to be
shortlisted for the job but the
certification involves a lot of training
which would help you understand the
concepts and prepare you for the
interview a lot better as well right so
getting yourself certified is quite
necessary in today's world let's look at
what the certification is all about the
certification involves a very Hands-On
training that trains an individual into
thinking about cyber security from
hackers perspective and developing this
mindset is very important because To
Catch a Thief you have to think like a
thief teaches the candidate to spot
vulnerabilities in a system so it trains
you on how to identify flaws how to
verify that they exist and then how to
treat them as well like I said this is a
very sort of a certification and
companies look for people who already
certified as ceh on a certified ethical
hacker so what is this certification all
about
uh this is a globally accepted
certification and it tests the knowledge
that a candidate will have about threats
and they're prevented preventive
mechanisms so the certification the exam
itself will test you on the parameters
the training would provide you with all
the information that you require to
clear the exam and to gain knowledge
from a real world perspective
so to train a candidate to think like a
hacker it will train the candidate to
use the tools to identify those flaws to
spot those flaws in the first place and
it will give an understanding to the
candidate where to look for those flaws
in the first place so essentially when
you get certified as a certified ethical
hacker you become a white hat hacker or
an ethical hacker which means that you
will be looking at flaws ethically and
Reporting them to those organizations
the certifying authorities the EC
Council it is a very well known and a
widely accepted certification Authority
across the globe it is based out of the
United States but the certification is
valid across the globe so what does it
take to take the exam and who can take
the exam in the first place now the
basic criteria is that candidates should
be 18 years and above so any person who
has completed an official EC Council
training is eligible to attend the exam
without going through an application
process so there are two ways you can
actually attempt the exam you either
have work experience that means you're
already in the cyber security space you
already have some you already have some
Hands-On knowledge and you want to give
the exam in that scenario you just have
to prove that you've got two years of
experience with network or information
security and then you can apply to EC
Council to directly appear for the exam
without attending the training else you
can then approach EC Council and
register yourself for a training course
after which you can hear the exam so
there are two ways that you can deal
with it what are the fees for this exam
now the fee itself is 500 for the exam
candidates who take the second route
where they prove that they have
experience and they directly want to
appear for the exam there is another
additional 100 of application fee that
they have to pay to EC Council for them
to verify that you actually have that
experience and then allow you to appear
for the exam so what are the exam
questions like what what is the exam all
about the exam code is 312 hyphen five
zero and there are 125 questions that
need to be answered in four hours now
that sounds like a lot of time but trust
me it isn't the questions are
descriptive in nature they give you a
scenario you have to identify those
keywords based on the knowledge and the
understanding that you have and then
gauge the correct answer for that
particular scenario and the scenarios
could be a little bit complex could be a
little bit confusing the exam will be a
multiple choice question exam so one
questions with four answers if any
question has multiple answers they will
mention it in the question itself the
past percentage cuts off at around 60 to
85 percent so there is no fixed
percentile every question has a
different grade every question has a
different value and based on the
questions that you have been asked and
the correctness of the answers you would
either pass somewhere between 60 to 85
percent the results are immediate so
once you complete the examin you submit
it it will let you know that itself
whether you have cleared or not so what
are the skills that you require for this
exam you must have very good networking
skills and when we say networking skills
you should know your protocols you
should know how computers communicate
with each other
the protocols like https FTP SMTP and
anything about the OSI layer you should
be good with your operating systems
the candidate should also have a very
good knowledge about operating systems
and when we say operating systems we
want the candidate to know about
troubleshooting methods and how the
operating system work in the first
manner so you should have some basic
skills about operating systems and the
configuration of these operating systems
uh you should also know the different
types of cyber attacks such as social
engineering phishing and how to prevent
these attacks so this is the exam skills
the training prepares you with all these
skills the candidate must be able to
hack into an organization system with
permission and erase all digital
evidences so the training itself will
get you accustomed with all the hacking
phases however hack is constructed how a
hack is made more effective and how the
hack evolves and later on how you can
delete all the evidences of the hack
that has happened so for the exam you
should have or you should be very good
with your networking skills
understanding protocols and how they
work configuring operating systems and
troubleshoot shooting them you should be
able to classify different cyber attacks
and know how to launch them as well and
you should be able to hack into devices
and there is All Digital evidences that
may have happened password cracking and
cryptography is also a very much
required skill to clear the exam there
must be few rules followed and there is
a Code of Ethics from EC Council so they
essentially give you a non-disclosure
agreement before you start the training
which you have to go through and you
have to sign it submit it to EC Council
only then are you allowed to go forward
with the exam so what are the exam all
about what are the topics within that
exam and what kind of questions would
you get so there are seven domains in
this training based on which they will
ask you questions when you say
background background is nothing but
your knowledge on networking skills uh
your knowledge on a little bit of
operating systems how Communications
happen how protocols work and so on so
forth analysis would be where you
analyze certain attacks and you're able
to analyze let's say kids and based on
those packets you can identify whether
it's a legitimate packet or is it a
malicious packet with any malicious data
within it then with security tools you
are able to talk about security as in
the concepts of security like
confidentiality integrity and
availability Triad the IEEE
identification authentication
authorization and accountability trial
uh aspects and various other Concepts
that are there in security so you'll be
questioned on those topics as well tools
and programs ethical hacking carries a
lot of tools and you should be
conversant with those tools uh in the
during the training there will be
hundreds of tools that you would be
going through and you would be facing
questions on these tools so there would
be some basic questions like commands
that would be given to you to identify
what that command would execute or there
would be a specific scenario given to
you and then they would ask you which is
the most suitable tool that you utilize
to crack that particular scenario and
then there is the methodology of course
of how or which steps would you take in
this particular attack to be successful
then we talk about policies and the
ethics so as you can see all of these
domains have different weightage in the
exam 21.79 percent for your background
so you can see the background
information is very much important
operating systems networking a little
bit of applications a little bit of
architecture of how things are deployed
now ceh is normally an advanced
certification right so there are a few
presumptions that you already know a
little bit about active directory how
operating systems work how identity
management works so there's a little bit
of presumption that you have these
background knowledge but in the training
you can be prepped up for that knowledge
as well so it does contain a little bit
of insights about how these things work
analysis is where you're looking at some
scenarios and based on the evidences
given to you you can analyze what's
going on so that's a 20.73 percent
security which is the main topic is at
23.7 three percent tools and programs
related to security would be at 28.91
percent the methodologies would carry a
weightage of 8.77 policies 1.90 and it
takes 2.17 percent so you have 125
questions you can figure out uh
percentile-wise how many questions you
would get on each of these domains so
let's have a look at these domains a
little bit more the background is about
Network and communication Technologies
again like I said protocols procedures
Services how computers work so ports on
a computer how how ports are utilized by
services and how Communications happen
over these services and these ports how
we can scan these posts to identify
what's going on and then try to find out
vulnerabilities within them then we have
got information security Technologies
and the information security threats as
well so when I want to launch an attack
on a device where would I find
vulnerabilities is it just on the
network do I look at the operating
system them do I look at different
applications that are there on the
operating system and so on so forth so
where are the threats that's something
that we need to identify and that's what
this domain deals with so 27 questions
from this domain then analysis and
assessment information security
assessment and Analysis and the security
assessment process so let's say you're
in a penetration test and you want to
launch an attack what does the
assessment that you want to do before
you launch that attack what is the
process you want to conduct and how
you're going to analyze the world
Liberty in the first place to identify
which penetration test or which attack
you should do at that particular point
in time then security would talk about
information security controls controls
would be all the security elements that
you can Implement to prevent hacking so
firewalls IDs IPS antiviruses or
endpoints all of these would be included
in this domain information security
attack detection so it's not only about
how you can attack you also want to know
if you're being attacked in the first
place so analysis would basically
identify how you're being attacked and
the detection is where where you first
detect that something is wrong after
which you can analyze it right and how
you can prevent uh security attacks
happening at your organization as well
so which firewall would fit at what OSI
layer what uh in the architectural
aspect where do you want to place your
ID IDs or an IPS where would you want to
place a firewall wherever you want to
place a UTM to have a layered approach a
structured structured approach towards
security where a hacker would have to
peel off layers of security to reach the
data that they wanted to get access to
in the first place so there will be 30
questions from the security domain 16
questions on the analysis and assessment
domain the fourth domain is the tool
systems and programs so this is where
all the tools that we would have
utilized
resume so this is where all the tools
that you have utilized in the ethical
hacking scenario and there will be
questions asked about those tools so in
the training there are some tools that
are prescribed in the course where
you'll have to concentrate on those
tools you'll have to get your hands on
on those tools to understand how those
tools work and then give appropriate
answers in this domain so there would be
36 questions for Tool systems and
programs then the fifth domain is
procedures and methodology information
security procedures and assessment
methodologies would be asked over here
so how would you conduct a test how will
you conduct a vulnerability assessment
what is the method and the procedures
that you would follow in conducting
these tests so there would be around 11
questions for this domain the sixth one
is regulations and policies so this is
all about some Basics that you need to
be aware about for information security
policies and Frameworks like ISO 27001
PCI DSS and these regulations that are
available in the real world that you can
that you can help you or guide you to
place a security architecture on your
organization these questions are not
going to be in depth about any of the
laws or policies it's just checking your
awareness whether you are aware of these
laws or policies and where they can be
implemented so we can see that only a
couple of questions that would come in
regulations and policies and then ethics
ethics is the code of conduct of how you
are expected to behave as an ethical
hacker what is expected out of your job
role what you should be doing and what
you shouldn't be doing so there would be
around three questions of Ethics in the
exam now let's look at a few sample
questions from the exam as well so this
will help you get an idea what the exam
questions would be so consider the
attack scenario given below there are
five steps listed step one starts with
user browsers a web page the second step
is where user web server replies with
the requested page and sets the cookie
on the user's browser in the third step
attacker steals the Cookie by either
creating an attack of on the network for
sniffing or at the application with
cross-site scripting or sending a fake
mail or a hosting a fake website by a
social engineering attack which is a
phishing attack in the fourth step
attacker gets access using whatever they
have done and orders a product using
modified cookies and in the fifth step
the product is actually delivered to the
attackers at risk whereas the bill is
footed by the victim so what is the
attack that is happening here identify
the web application attack is it a
session fixation attack is it a
unvalidated redirect attack is it a
cookie poisoning attack or is it a
denial of service attack so again going
through these steps which of these would
be the correct answer in this scenario
it is C which is a cookie poisoning
attack because if you look at the steps
the attacker basically hijacked the
cookie or stole the cookie and then
modified it to be utilized for some
malicious reasons second question which
one of the following scanning techniques
do attackers use to bypass firewall
rules logging mechanics systems and also
hide themselves as usual Network traffic
a stealth scanning technique B TCP
connect scanning technique C mentoring
access or D fin scanning technique now
here as you can understand we need to
know what these techniques are right so
what does a fin scan mean what is
maintaining access what is TCP connect
what does TCP mean TCP is transmission
control protocol how does it work so
when you connect using TCP what is
actually happening in the back end that
is what the knowledge is all about and
in here the correct answer is a stealth
scanning technique so what do we mean by
stealth how can we achieve that which
tools help us achieve that that is what
we want to gain an understanding in
before we can attempt the exam question
three which of the following Wi-Fi
chalking method refers to drawing
symbols in public places to advertise
open Wi-Fi networks War walking War
flying War chalking or while driving now
here we need to know first that there is
something known as y Wi-Fi chalking
right and there are some symbols that
are utilized globally and they are
recognized globally they're standardized
by the way and these symbols represent
some type of Wi-Fi networks for example
open wi-fi which means you can freely
connect to the Wi-Fi or paid Wi-Fi where
you have to pay before you can connect
to the Wi-Fi or once you get connected
you're first to have to make a payment
only then the internet would be
activated right so for different Wi-Fi
mechanisms there are different options
that can be utilized and which of the
question is which of the Wi-Fi chalking
method refers to drawing these symbols
in public places to advertise open wi-fi
so in this the answer is what shocking
now the question here itself is a little
bit so here the question itself is is a
little bit misleading because it
mentions Wi-Fi chalking in the question
itself and that would then lead us to
whether or talking is a correct answer
or not so some of the questions could be
a little bit misleading so let's start
looking at the certifications so to be
an ethical hacker you must hold a
certification which specializes in
ethical hacking or in cyber security
companies look for candidates who are
globally certified when we say globally
certified they're looking for a
certificate that has been given by an
organization that is recognized globally
and is well accepted in the industry so
these are the top five certifications a
candidate can obtain the first one
become a certified ethical hacker then
there is global information assurance
certification penetration tester then
offensive security certified
professional CompTIA pen Test Plus and
finally the license penetration tester
now these certifications are offered by
different organizations all of these
organizations are recognized globally
and their certifications are well
accepted in the technical space so let's
start off with the certified ethical
hacker and we'll look at the
organizations that provide these
certifications and how we can attain
them so CE H or certified ethical hacker
in its current form is in its version 10
it's been revised and updated over a
period of time easy council is the
certifying Authority for ceh they have
their own authorized training centers
through which you can attend trainings
give those exams get yourself certified
and thus become globally certified and
can be eligible to apply for security
related jobs it is a very well known
certification and is widely accepted at
the same time it would test the
candidate's knowledge of security
threats and preventive measures now
there are two types of exams that you
can give with ceh one is a multiple
choice question exam which is
theoretical in nature they ask you
questions and you answer the correct you
select the correct answers if you're
clear you get certified the second
certification nowadays is where there's
a practical exam associated with it
that's a you'll have to purchase the
voucher for that exam and give that exam
the Practical exam is held in a Virtual
Lab where they you're given in scenarios
and based on those scenarios you have to
resolve the questions given to you and
give proof of the resolution which would
then get you certified as an ethical
hacker the theoretical exam in this
scenario is the fees is around 500 this
is for the multiple choice question exam
where you can pay the fees and you can
attend through a online portal and you
can give the exam directly the exam is
four hours long in which you have to
answer 125 questions now four hours for
125 questions seems a long time but it
isn't it's a very technical exam there
are scenario based questions and it
would take some time for you to analyze
and understand the question and then
identify the equivalent correct answer
so it's a very competitive exam and
you'll have to study really hard to
clear this exam as well the cutoff for
passing varies from 60 to 85 percent so
there is no exact grade and and all the
questions have different weightages so
depending on the questions that have
been given to you and the way that you
have answered them you would pass at
either sixty percent or you would pass
when you've scored 85 percent once you
are see it certified which is a very
technical certification you will be
qualified to apply for job roles as a
penetration tester or a security
engineer these are job roles where you
would be responsible of ethically trying
to attack applications servers switches
and try to find out vulnerabilities
within them the training of this
certification will make you Adept in
most of these tools that are required
there are a lot of practicals in this
training and if you successfully
completed those practicals clearing the
exam is a easy task with the practicals
comes your knowledge and would help you
understand how you would be performing
penetration tests in the real world an
average annual salary in the USA for a
CE certified person is around ninety one
thousand dollars and and in India is
around 4 like 76 000 odd rupees the
salaries would vary as far as
organizations are concerned uh more
established organizations can afford to
pay a little bit more but these are
average salaries that we have seen
across the market the next certification
is the G Pen also known as the global
information assurance certification
penetration tester this certification
looks into the different pen testing
practices and methods also focuses on
the various problems and Pen testing so
again this is where you're getting
certified as a penetration tester so
it's again a technical certification
where your knowledge on networking
applications and security of which would
be tested you will be trained on this of
course so the training will include all
these areas where you need to focus
identify those problems and thus be
ready for the real world scenarios the
candidate will have to understand
networking Concepts and operating
systems in his Linux and windows and you
should be very well aware of the TCP
protocols this is true for any of of the
technical certifications for ethical
hacking giac is the certification
provider it's again a very well renowned
and well accepted certification
Authority across the globe the exam fees
are 1899 82 215 questions to be answered
in three hours now why 82 215 it depends
on the test that has been Associated and
depending on how you are answering those
questions uh you would be given those
many number of questions to begin with
but all of these need to be answered in
three hours 74 is the past percentage
that is required to clear this exam the
average annual salary in the USA is
around 96 000 while in India it is
around similar to certified ethical
hacking then looking at the next
certification from offensive security
called the oscp offensive security
certified professional this is another
penetration testing certification highly
technical in nature and it is an
entirely Hands-On certification the
previous two certifications that we saw
we talked about CH where there are two
different exams you could either take
the theoretical exam and give your mcqs
or you could take the Practical one here
you don't have an option this is a
practical exam so the test is conducted
on a virtual Network so they send out
instructions to you there's a virtual
lab that is given out to you and they
give you the questions and you have to
perform those assessments create those
reports and provide it to the certifying
Authority in this case offensive
security uh if you match their criterias
of whatever you have identified in those
reports you get certified here the
requirements of good understanding of
networking protocols how systems
function how Kali Linux operating system
functions and the candidate must for
complete offensive Securities
penetration testing with the Kali Linux
course and pass the Hands-On exam so
this focuses purely on Kali Linux Kali
Linux is an operating system that is
freely distributed over the internet and
comes structured with around 300 plus
tools used for ethical hacking so this
course totally relies on Kali Linux for
you to use as a tool set for penetration
testing the certificate provider has
stated is offensive security the name of
the course is oscp offensive security
certified professional exam is around
800 to
1550. Now understand that this exam is
Technical and is Hands-On so for you to
prepare for this exam they come up with
virtual Labs where you can start
practicing and honing your skills
depending on the number of days for
which you have purchased the access to
that particular Labs the amount will
vary from 800 which would be the minimum
access days available to one thousand
five hundred and fifty dollars where the
maximum number of days would be given to
you for practicing once you're ready
even during the time time span of where
you have that access once you are ready
for the exam you can they can attempt
the exam and clear the average annual
salary is similar around ninety one
thousand dollars for the US market and
905 000 rupees in the Indian market then
looking at the CompTIA pen Test Plus
CompTIA is another certification
Authority or a certification provider a
training provider that that will help
you get yourself certified in the
ethical hacking space so they have
certification called pen Test Plus which
is focused towards penetration testing
so it is an intermediate level
certification it assists the
vulnerability assessment and the
penetration testing skills of a
candidate here the training will provide
you with all the essentials where it
will help you identify how to do
vulnerability assessments how to
identify those vulnerabilities and then
which tools to utilize for what kind of
a penetration test for the requirements
a minimum of three to four years of
hands-on experience in the information
security field also a CompTIA Security
Plus or a network Plus or equivalent
knowledge is required so in the network
plus they talk about securing net works
and they help you understand the OSI
layers the TCP layers and help you
understand the protocols and all of
those things so having that knowledge is
an added Advantage the certificate
provider is CompTIA and the cost of the
exam is around 349 dollars maximum
number of questions is 85 and I think
it's a three hour exam the passing
percentage is uh scoring 750 marks out
of a possible 900 so the scale is the
minimum you can ever score is 100 if
you're completely and be prepared the
maximum you can score is 900. you get a
leeway of 150 marks for your
certifications so you have to score a
minimum of 750 to clear the exam average
annual salary for a Hampshire certified
penetration test plus professional is
ninety seven thousand dollars in the US
market and in the Indian market it would
be around 5 lakh rupees then comes the
license penetration test now this is an
advanced certificate again from EC
Council this is where AC transfer gives
you a license which certifies that you
have undergone thorough training and
have cleared your exam in which you can
conduct or lead a audit for
vulnerability assessment and penetration
testing it is an expert level
certification comes after the ceh
certification it is the ultimate test
which tests this candidate's penetration
testing skills so there are two
certifications over here one is the ecsa
EC Council certified security analyst
once you clear that you get you can
appear for the license penetration
tester both of these are Hands-On
certifications so you will be given a
Virtual Lab you will be given a scenario
in which you'll have to perform some
assessments create reports submitted to
the EC Council they will analyze your
reports if they meet the criterias that
have been identified you would then be
certified as a licensed penetration
Tester the candidate must be above 18
years of age page a recertification is
required every three years so the
validity is three years after three
years you will have to be re-certified
or there is a continuing Point education
system over there where you can score
points by publishing articles by
attending trainings or giving out
trainings and you can get yourself
re-certified it is preferred that the
candidate has CH and the ecsa
certification so the previous
certification that we saw certified
ethical hacker and then the ecsa EC
console certified security analyst after
which you can appear for the lpt
licensed penetration Tester the
certificate provider again is EC Council
the licensed penetration tester exam has
a different process the candidate must
purchase an exam dashboard for 899
dollars which is valid for a year so
once you purchase the voucher the
validity is one year you can prepare
within that one year and then give the
exam and attain the certification only
once you are ready the exam can be
scheduled and you can give that exam the
exam consists of three different levels
each level has three different
challenges the candidate must pass at
least one challenge in order to qualify
for the next level and for each level
the exam is 6 hours so this is a
growling exam this is Hands-On we are
giving you challenges and they are going
to test you on your skills as a
penetration tester so be ready to be
very Hands-On for this kind of a
certification average annual salary in
the US is around hundred thousand
dollars and above and in India 825 000
and above
next Shruti will guide you through the
career of an ethical hacker with the
increase in the number of cyber crimes
across the globe there is also an
increase in the number of cyber security
jobs and the role of an ethical hacker
tops the list hi guys this is Shruti
from Simply learn and today I will run
you through this video on ethical
hacking career so let's get started and
explore the world of ethical hacking
let's begin with a few facts did you
know that by the year 2021 there will be
3.5 million cyber security job openings
that is a huge number isn't it and also
according to the U.S Bureau of Labor
Statistics there will be 28 increase in
the number of jobs from 2016 to 2026.
for information security analysts which
includes ethical hackers this proves
that there is a great demand for ethical
hackers at the moment as I mentioned
earlier the number of cyber crimes
across the world will increase as the
digital era will only continue to grow
organizations will be be on the lookout
to hire professionals who can fight
these cyber crimes and protect the
company's data and to fight these cyber
crimes we will require individuals who
can think like a hacker and who is that
well to do this job we have ethical
hackers as you might be knowing an
ethical hacker is trained to discover
system vulnerabilities an ethical hacker
is also known as a white hat hacker he
or she is given authorization from the
company to perform security assessments
and at the end an ethical hacker would
have to report the findings back to the
company so that the vulnerabilities can
be fixed an ethical hacker performs
these security assessments with the help
of various hacking techniques and tools
let's now move on to our next topic that
is the steps to become an ethical hacker
you might wonder how to start your
ethical hacking career right well I will
take you through that step by step
firstly the candidate must have a
computer science or an information
technology bachelor's degree it is also
possible to become an ethical hacker
without these degrees but provided you
have the required skill sets and
experience the next requirement to be an
ethical hacker is that the candidate
must have a minimum of two years of
experience in the information security
field you have to start your career with
a software or a networking job and only
then can you move on to the ethical
hacking field you have to start your
career with a software or a networking
job and only then can you move into the
ethical hacking field coming to the
certifications it is necessary for the
candidate to hold various cyber security
certifications certifications play a
vital role in the field of cyber
security your job opportunities can
solely depend on these certifications to
become an ethical hacker you can start
off with the foundational level
certifications such as the CCNA and
CompTIA Security Plus certifications
finally the last step to become an
ethical hacker is to clear the certified
ethical hacker examination CH
certificate education is provided by the
EC Council it trains the candidate to
protect a company's Network by using the
same tools and methods that a hacker
would use the CH exam will have a
duration of four hours with 125 number
of questions if the candidate clears
this exam then he or she will become a
certified ethical hacker now that you
know the steps to become an ethical
hacker let's look into the skill sets
which are required to help you achieve
these steps first and foremost an
ethical hacker needs to have an in-depth
knowledge of the working of the
operating systems knowledge of Windows
Linux and Macintosh operating systems is
required for penetration testing
creating exploits and bug hunting
programming will be important so
knowledge of programming languages such
as CEC plus plus HTML Python and PHP
will be very helpful basic knowledge of
networking TCP protocols and OSI model
is necessary as networking is the
foundation of cyber security for
securing databases knowledge of SQL
nosql postgresql is necessary
cryptography is used to secure
information it is the process of
converting data from a readable format
to a non-readable format and vice versa
cryptanalysis is decryption without a
secret key in most cases certified
ethical hacker would need to perform
cryptanalysis hence ethical hacker has
to be comfortable with cryptography and
cryptanalysis ethical hackers should be
proficient in network security control
measures such as intrusion detection and
intrusion prevention techniques now
let's move on to the responsibilities
which are taken care of by an ethical
hacker let's have a look at these
responsibilities an ethical hacker is
responsible for scanning systems open
and closed ports using tools like nessus
and nmap vulnerabilities and threats are
identified by doing this in addition to
scanning for vulnerabilities they also
search the Deep corners of the network
to spot critical information such as
passwords which can make the
organization vulnerable to an attack in
addition to building and maintaining IDs
IPS and firewalls they also try to evade
these security measures to gauge the
performance of the systems a lot of
times a company's online fraud or online
theft incidents are looked into by an
ethical hacker an ethical hacker also
checks for sniffing networks and
hijacked web servers and applications
those were the responsibilities of an
ethical hacker now let's look into the
various job roles in ethical hacker can
apply for it is a misconception that an
ethical hacker will perform only
penetration testing well there are a
number of other jobs and ethical hacker
can apply for the different job roles
such as that of a penetration tester
information security analyst security
consultant and an information security
manager manager let's have a look at
each of these job roles one by one a
penetration tester performs the typical
responsibility of an ethical hacker that
is he or she tries to exploit a security
system's vulnerabilities this is carried
out using different hacking tools and
techniques an ethical hacker can also
apply for the role of an information
security analyst there is a difference
between the job rules of a penetration
tester and that of an information
security analyst here the candidate will
be required to primarily design and
protect the organization's network from
various cyber attacks finally the
candidate is also required to document
the identified security breaches so that
it can be omitted the next time the
responsibilities of a security
consultant is more or less similar to
that of an information security analyst
that we saw previously as a security
consultant you will be responsible to
design Implement and maintain various
Security architectures in addition to
this you're also required to upgrade the
security systems as and when required
finally an ethical hacker can also apply
to the role of an information security
manager as the name suggests this role
will require the candidate to possess
managerial skills as an information
security manager is responsible to head
the it and the information security team
now that we have seen the
responsibilities the skills and the
steps to become an ethical hacker let's
have a look at the different companies
hiring ethical hackers to name a few we
have Bank of America
Ernest and Young KPMG Urban Pro and IBM
let's now look into the salary structure
of an ethical hacker well in India the
average annual salary of a certified
ethical hacker is nearly 4 lakhs 76 000
rupees and in the US the average annual
salary of a certified ethical hacker is
91 000 now I will guide you through a
sample resuming of a penetration tester
as you can see on your screens this is a
sample resume of a penetration tester we
will look into this resume closely and
understand how your resume should look
like if you are applying for the role of
a penetration tester as always you can
start off with your name and your email
ID and your phone number followed by a
brief summary of your current job
profile it is preferred to add your
LinkedIn profile link here and also your
GitHub profile link if you have one as I
mentioned earlier this is a sample
resume for a penetration tester and
hence we have to have more than two
years of experience in the information
security field as you can see under the
experience section the candidate has two
prior experiences out of which the first
experience is that of a software tester
and second is that of a penetration
tester you would have to mention your
latest or current experience at the
beginning you can mention your job role
and the company and the duration under
which you can list out the various
responsibilities that you are looking
into currently if you are a penetration
tester you can mention responsibilities
such as security monitoring Black Box
testing documentation of the results
vulnerability scanning and so on below
this you can mention your first
company's experience with the roles and
responsibilities that you have performed
earlier here the candidate was a
software tester before becoming a
penetration tester let's move on to the
education section here the candidate
holds a bachelor's degree in computer
science you can mention your degree
followed by the university name or if
you're applying for any other role in
the cyber security domain it is
recommended that you list out the
certifications as well to start off with
a CCNA certification will be preferred
followed by a certified ethical hacker
certification which is a must if you are
applying for the role of a penetration
tester in addition to it the certified
expert penetration tester certification
will also hold a great advantage
after mentioning the certifications you
can go ahead and mention your skill sets
here we have the technical skills and
non-technical skills under technical
skills you can mention the programming
languages that you know here we have C C
plus plus Java pull you can also mention
the operating systems that you have
worked on for example Windows Linux Unix
and in addition to the programming
languages and the OS you can also
mention the tools that you know such as
nmap Metasploit tools which will be
helpful if you are applying for the role
of a penetration tester then you can
also mention encryption Technologies
knowledge of SQL and Bug tracking
systems if you have worked on them
before if you have participated in
ecodathons you can mention that here as
well under the non-technical skills you
can mention various competitions that
you have taken part in and the games
that you like and other extracurricular
activities finally you can also mention
the projects undertaken under the
projects undertaken you can talk about
the various projects that you have
performed in your company or outside the
company here we have two projects one as
a software test engineer and second one
as a penetration tester so this is how a
resume of a penetration tester will look
like Linux for ethical hacking if you
have never used Linux before and are
looking to get into it this is the
perfect opportunity for you to learn on
how you can use this operating system in
your daily lives now although this video
is specifically catered towards people
who are trying to get into cyber
security or who are trying to learn
ethical hacking the more people that get
into Linux is that much easier because
it just provides an alternative
operating system that you can use and
perform in your day-to-day lives now uh
it's very important especially for
ethical hackers to understand how Linux
works and specifically how Kali Linux
works that we are going to cover today
now as Kali Linux is also an operating
system dedicated specifically to cyber
security analysts and hackers and has a
bunch of tools that makes the process of
ethical hacking and vulnerability
analysis malware analysis very easy
so in this Linux crash course we will
learn everything about car Linux what it
is what you can use it for then
understanding a bit more of the Linux
system fundamentals now that can span
across a multi a variety of topics for
the Linux fundamentals we often have how
to navigate the file system how we can
use the Linux operating system command
terminal for creating editing and just
manipulating files will understand some
networking commands that can help you
we'll understand how this uh the service
mechanism how to start store start
Services stop services will understand
how to install uninstall some particular
tools will also create a small script
with bash so that you can understand how
you can use the bash language to start
your scripting journey in Carl Linux
directly before we move forward let's
check out the ceh certification course
by simply learn if you want to learn
more about cyber security and ethical
hacking in general check out our CH
certification training course the
certified ethical hacker certification
is the industry standard for train
penetration testers and our training
program will ensure you are well
equipped with all the necessary skills
and techniques required to Ace the exam
we'll get an exam voucher for free with
the course allowing you to learn master
and Excel as a penetration tester with a
single package you can find the link for
the course in the description box below
that being said we can get started with
our demonstration now the first thing we
need to understand is how we can install
Linux properly to install Linux or Kali
Linux to be specific in this case we
will need two things one we need the ISO
file which is basically the installation
file of every single operating system
and we will need an environment to run
it in now many people
um use Linux or any other operating
system as a dual boot in the system so
that when you start up your computer or
a laptop it will ask you where do you
want to boot into do you want to boot
into Windows or color Linux or Ubuntu
something like that but for easier
access what many people prefer and many
people will recommend is using a
virtualization software so what that
will happen is you will keep using your
normal Windows operating system but you
can use virtualization software like
virtualbox or VMware to run Linux
operating systems in Windows directly it
will run in a sandboxed environment
which makes it easier to learn and you
don't have to dedicate another
bootloader access and it just gets a
whole lot complicated dual booting is a
lot more complicated and it is recommend
it is recommended for beginners to just
stick with virtualization software now
for virtualization software you will get
two options here which will be virtual
Box by Oracle or
VMware
now I highly recommend VMware
because I feel it is much more stable
and it has a a bit more fluidity when
learning operating systems now since you
are running full-fledged operating
systems in a single window your system
must have a good amount of ram free so
that it can be completely dedicated to
the operating system being run in the
sandboxed environment so I would really
recommend a VMware or virtualbox which I
feel is has become slightly dated now
meanwhile VMware Workstation player is
going to be much better
this is obviously a case of preference
and you can try out virtualbox if you
want most of the things will be similar
but once you download VMware and install
it
you should be getting a window like this
now this is the works workstation you
can get the VMware Player version which
is the free version you can get that
element as well and again most of the
things will be similar so now that we
have VMware and we have our environment
where we are going to install Linux and
work on it
let's check Kali Linux now Kali next as
you can see it's the world's most
advanced penetration testing
distribution and more importantly it is
based on Debian Debian is one of the uh
you can say the forefathers of operating
systems one of the operating systems
which paved the way for many Linux
distributions to be based on it apart
from Kali we also have another operating
system which is called parrot security
this is also uh used by ethical hackers
and cyber security analysts because this
has the uh this functions the same way
as Kali Linux as in it has all the tools
and techniques that you may require in
your ethical hacking Journey
so uh you can use either of them either
color Linux or pirate security and more
importantly for today's video actually
any Linux distribution will do because
this is more about learning the basics
and the basics will stay same
irrespective if you go for Kali parrot
Ubuntu or any other business division
that you can think of but I'm just
letting you know that there are two
options here that it has a bit more
features but Kali Linux is the industry
standard today and has been for like a
decade now at this point uh so it is
much recommended to go with Kali and
that's what we are going to work on
today so to download the ISO file we'll
just click the download button here
and you can see it offers a variety of
options you can directly download for
virtual machines which is see as you can
see it is the recommended but it is it
is going to deprive you of a few
um learning things so what we can do is
we will get the live boot system what
live boot will do it will provide the
ISO file which we can later use to
install on our VMware system so I will
go to the live pool
includes everything
as you can see I got a torrent file
I will place this torrent for download
now
actually instead of the torrent we can
just download the point release live
image uh this actually here this version
had every tool possible but this one
this uh January Edition you can see Kali
23.1 the January live version pointless
live image you can just download this
one directly just click the download
button here which is written as 3.8 gigs
the ISO file size just click on download
and your download will start
remember once again you can do this
process with parrot security directly as
well I think if you go to download
button here
yes we have to choose the security
Edition now they also have multiple
versions for let's say the home edition
is for daily use you know
um just casual browsing or just a
multimedia process all those things hack
the box is completely separate uh
service that functions easy to easy to
hack
boxes that will be a completely separate
Edition similar to Cloud architect and
Raspberry Pi but if you are going to use
parrot security get the security Edition
directly just download it from here and
you it you'll be good to go but for now
we are just going to install Kal nut
since that is what the majority of
Industry uses
and we'll move forward with it I can
help you
these are the containers
yes now what what would have happened if
you are chosen virtual machine is as you
can see there are many virtualization
software like VMware virtualbox and
chemo it what will provide is it will
provide a installed file it will give a
folder where the virtualbox have VMware
has already installed car Linux so you
can just load up in your VMware system
as you can see you can it will you have
to choose open a virtual machine if you
download the image directly this one so
you can just open up that folder and
your operating system will load on its
own but why after getting the iso you
can customize a lot of things the thing
about this virtual images are they are
not customizable as such with the iso I
can customize how much harder space I
want to devote to just the sandbox
operating system how much how much RAM
usage although those rhyme usage and all
can be customized everything will be
tailor made based on your specific needs
so we will check that once the download
is completed which is just one minute
remaining apart from that you can see
there is a 64-bit I think this is 32-bit
as well I'm not sure if a third bit is
required nowadays considering everything
is 64.
but yes before uh while the iso is
getting downloaded let's check out
VMware Workstation now to get started at
creating a sandboxed environment we will
touch upon create a new virtual machine
yes
uh here we can let's say check on custom
because we want to customize how much we
want to give
Hardware we can use workstation 16.x
which is the latest one
now here I am going to choose I will
install the operating system later
if I give the ISO file here directly it
will install the operating system on its
own which can kind of diffuse the
purpose if that was the case we would
have downloaded the live image anyway we
I will click on I will install the
operating system later
we will choose in the guest operating
system we will choose Linux and make
sure you choose dbn 10.x 64-bit as we
read in the website
okay
it is based on previous
distribution
now this can obviously change there are
other operating systems on which others
can be based on like Fedora and uh Arch
but this one is devian so we are going
to choose devian over here Libyan
turning 64-bit which is the latest
version
click on next we will name it as
Kali
Linux
and click on next
the number of processors I am going to
give two processors here
total processor course is four this you
can determine based on how much how
powerful your system is and how much you
can give as it is because a major part
of how how a virtual machine runs is not
just how much RAM you give to it is how
much RAM is available outside one
sandbox environment because if let's say
your system is uh has eight gigabytes of
RAM you devote four gigabytes to the
virtual machine Windows itself takes up
around 4 GB uh at least 3.5 GB when it's
sitting idle so you have to account for
all that when dedicating processors and
more importantly Ram as well so we're
going to click on next for now and here
what I'm going to do is I am going to
give 2.5 gigabits of ram which should be
enough for the thing at least the things
that we are doing today this can be
customized later on as well let's say
you have started working and then you
realize the amount of ram that you have
given it's just not enough and you need
a bit more then you can customize that
later for now I am going to give 2.5
gigabits of RAM
you can see the recommended is 2 gigabit
anyway I'll just go a step further click
on next
use Network address translation is the
network connection as in what kind of
networking it should have the virtual
sandbox should have considering it is
being run inside an operating system
your windows whatever internet
connection is given to your windows will
go to college nuts directly but you can
customize that let's say you don't want
networking you want host only networking
that you connect the guest operating
system to a VPN later on it's a
completely customizable process but for
easiest access we are going to use use
Network address translation
well IO controller types LSI is always
going to be the most recommended so just
go ahead with it choose a Cai for the
virtual Disk type now these are
different virtual disk types that can be
used and they have different purposes
like some make it easier to transition
between multiple uh installations of
VMware or virtualbox based on what
you've chosen but SCSI is always
considered the best could be we will
create a new virtual disk
now this is the maximum disk size other
disk capacity how much harder storage we
are going to devote for the operating
system installation and all the files
whatever you work in the system that
will be stored somewhere right so we're
going to devote the basically the uh
Chrome size to make it easier to
understand so I will give
30 gigabits
of memory size
now here you have another option
uh you can actually allocate all disk
space now as it is written allocating
the full capacity can enhance
performance which requires all of the
physical displays to be available right
now so the good thing about VMware is if
I think that's in virtualbox as well if
I do not click this even though I have
written 30 gigabits
he does not take up all of the 30
gigabits in your hard disks it takes how
much ever is required let's say after
installation and everything uh it takes
up 10 gigabits of space that is all that
will be taken up it won't take up all to
30 gigabits the more you keep working
and slowly the data increases the size
increases of the virtual machine a
folder it will go up to 30 gigabits
that's it
so if you allocate all of it now it will
take up the 30 gigabits directly and it
will be slightly more performance
because it will remove that read
functionality when the virtual when the
virtual machine is being run so I will
click it and between these two options
between single files and multiple files
single files is faster but multiple
files will make it easier if you want to
move your virtual machine system from
let's say one laptop to another or you
have to switch between personal and
official systems but for now I can
choose a single file
130 disk file will be created you can
just put whatever name
and I think everything else is subtle
now what we will do is we will click on
finish
it will take some time to create the
disk
I think the iso download would have been
completed yes the iso download is
completed by now
it will just take a while to create the
disk
that is also Kali net Hunter which is a
mobile penetration testing platform it
is available only on Android
uh you can use it to perform small tasks
obviously you can't you can't perform
everything that you can on call Linux
desktop environment but a lot of the
things can be performed like basic
Network scanning and some amount of
sniffing and uh
brute forcing tools all those things can
be performed on net Hunter directly but
that is a video for another day so we'll
just wait till the disk is created and I
will move forward with the process
as you can see the virtual machine is
now created so the next step would be to
actually align the ISO file so we're
going to click on edit virtual machine
settings here
we'll select the CD DVD
position
use ISO image file we're going to browse
go to downloads
use the Carly Linux ISO and click on OK
so now we can power on
select live system AMD 64.
at all times okay you can see a pop-up
here below that says
physical computer that we are going to
do which should be color NX in this case
it just shows Debian because it is based
on trivia that's it when you are done
and the operating system boots Up Click
I finish installing so we will do that
when the time is correct
so say the live boot running up
remember
okay you can see Carl Linux is booting
up now you get the uh the usage CPU
usage meter here and this should be
the memory
yes
okay so we have entered booted into the
desktop these are the multiple
workspaces but once again this is not
installed
but we going have to do is install this
operating system
you can see you can use in the live
environment you can use everything but
you just have to
install this operating system directly
the networking system is working
okay
so once you familiarize yourself with
the Kali Linux operating system and more
importantly in the live environment you
are able to check if the amount of ram
that you have given and your processor
in general is able to sustain everything
or not even what we will do is we will
just power off the virtual machine
again power on and this time will not
choose the live system what we will
choose is we'll go down
we'll choose the advanced installation
options
we'll click graphical install and and
stop that's it now what this will do is
to launch the graphical installer
instead of the live system some
operating systems like parrot security
for example will allow you to install
directly from the live environment but
that's it it's not really a very big
difference if you run it from here or
there now the installation installer is
launched I'm sorry I will click the
English language yes
it lasts for your location so that it
will set your time zone I will choose
India configure the keyboard you can
choose American English considering that
is the standard keyboard layouts that is
available on the market
it will load the additional components
like the networking modules the input
output device detection drivers all
those things
some of the partitioning devices as well
I think
uh it will check the network Hardware
next
configuring
configuring the hook with DHCP
yes uh now that we have to create uh
select the hostname the hostname I will
just keep it as Kali that's not a very
big deal this is more important if
you're a lot into networking and you
want to have you know particular home
networks as a kind of like acting as a
server for the all the devices in your
home Wi-Fi otherwise it's not an issue
uh same thing with the domain name I
will skip the domain name because it's
not really essential for what we are
doing here yes but the username will
obviously be required the full name I
will give it as similar for example
I'll keep the same username that was the
full name this is the username
password
you can give based on your wish
make sure the passwords the same
this is the single user by the way you
can obviously create multiple users like
we do on multiple other operating
systems now it will check the disk
partitioning
here since we are installing a VMware
any virtualized software version works
for VMware we will use guided which is
use entire disk continue as you can see
we had devoted 30 GB test showing 32.2
similar situation here we're going to
click on continue all files in one
partition which is recommended for new
users you have you can partition it to
home where TMP may be a
other partitions as well that you can
keep a swap partition as well but that's
not necessary now we'll keep all of them
in a single partition just make sure all
the changes right it will create the
swap memory on its own and click on
continue
it will ask that these are the changes
being made just select yes
continue
and it will start installing Kalin Linux
into the VMware virtual disk now this
will take some time so we will speed
this off and come back to it when the
installation is done
so now we have to set the package
manager the main partitioning system is
done and most of the installation part
is done you just have to configure the
package manager and use a network mirror
click on yes
if you do you don't need to set up
anything else here you can just click on
next and it will set up apt which is the
package manager of Kali Linux now the
package manager will do is help us
install and install
update the tools and libraries that call
Linux uses all the softwares and all the
tools that we're going to use later on
it will configure the package manager
for now
it's almost done
oh
now it's installing the grub bootloader
which will uh when you start up the
system it will ask you where do you want
to log in
yes install the group order to my
primary drive click on continue
it'll just select Dev SDA which is you
will find a single uh Drive anyway
instead of entering enter device name
manually just click on whatever the
storage space is being uh written below
that now if you're using it on
virtualbox or VMware which you are doing
right now you will get only one storage
that's it if you're dual booting you'll
get multiple and you'll have to make
some choices but that is Advanced and we
don't need to get into that right now
for now only the last one should be
enough now it is finalizing the
installation
foreign
solution clicks that's all
and as you can see the installation is
complete so please choose continue to
reboot
we'll just press continue
now it loaded in a lot of the packages
during the live version and during the
installer so that it can continue with
the installation so it's going to remove
that live package all from the ram
and complete the process
as you can see color Linux has rebooted
and is going to the installed operating
system now
foreign
if you're a beginner into Linux you will
run into a lot of the commands being
shown just don't freak out it's all
normal
it does take some time to start up
depending on how much memory you have
given it how much I am you have devoted
to it how much even how much hardness
you have given it also depends on that
and obviously it also relies on how much
memory your Windows operating system is
using so that how much extra Ram is
available and how well windows can push
VMware Workstation so you have the login
screen we are going to use whatever
username and password we had set during
installation to login
now this will be the roof user you'll
understand more about that just now
let's just allow it to boot completely
foreign
so now we have called Linux operating
system installed and ready to go and
what I would recommend the first thing
is just go around just check if you're
new to Linux don't make a lot of changes
or anything like that but do move around
for example if you can just click the
start button here which is termed as
applications
you can see a lot of the programs that
are installed now the good thing about
Calvin assets it's very help intuitive
so for example information gathering
you'll see all the tools that you can
use for information gathering now same
for vulnerability analysis web app
analysis password attacks all the brute
forcing tools that you can use the
wireless attacks like air crack uh River
example sniffing networks like Wireshark
Etc so just go around the operating
system C uh check the file manager how
it works and you know
basically get a feel for the operating
system directly
okay you see here's the file manager
just check another thing how it's
working you can enter the settings and
move and make some small small changes
now a lot of the settings won't matter a
lot in when running virtually but it's
good to know and understand what are the
things that Linux offers
so it's a very important step one more
thing if you are in a virtual machine is
make sure that VMware tools is installed
usually this gets installed directly but
if not you can just reinstall here okay
I think so our environment is ready and
set up
now as you might know a major part of
Linux is the command line so we're going
to click the terminal here or you can
just open right terminal has open
so this is basically the
command line that you can use in a Mac
OS or windows so a lot of the things
that we do on wind on Linux is in the
command line itself now you can use
General uh graphical tools like uh let's
say the file manager for example you can
do use graphical tools you can use other
networking tools as well but it's
something it's always better to use the
terminal because one you can reach
things faster compared to a graphical
tools considering you just have to write
a single command and that's it for most
of the tools other than having to
navigate through a lot of menus and
sections and other compartments that you
have to do on a graphical interface so
we will have to focus more on this
command line terminal and the first
thing that we have to learn in the
command line terminal is the sudo user
or the root user we had discussed uh
when creating the user but I told that
that will be the root user considering
we are only adding just one user for now
okay so let's break that apart actually
uh Sudo is the keyword that we are
looking for okay now the super user or
the root user administrator of the
system is going to be someone who has
the uh all the access to access
everything all the sensitive files all
the sensitive settings all those things
now if you can just see uh let's say if
I want to open a file I'm going to put
cat
Etc
shadow
it's a permission denied cat is the way
to open up text files by the way now
this file does exist but I cannot open
it because the permission is denied I am
not the root user right now I'm just
simply on Android Kali now the terminal
does not go into root mode by default
because it does it's not it's not safe
from a security perspective so we have
to check on what are the things that can
be done securely
that's why what we will do is we will
write down now sudo
let's say it uh suro is the command for
an invoking the root user we will write
the same command which is
shadow
it will ask you for your root password
that we set before
we'll just put the same password and as
you can see
it showed the details of the Shadow
password Shadow file
so why uh so that's the reason actually
why it's not recommended to have the
root user at all times it's all uh it's
not recommended meanwhile what you can
do is let's say you work a lot with the
pseudo password for example a lot of the
things that we're going to do in this
video will require the sudo keyword
which is the root access now if you just
open a new tab for example
you'll get another terminal without any
issues now one thing I want to note out
is if you are learning a lot of the
tools use that require the sudo command
like opening sensitive files like this
one HC Shadow or making small small
changes that require root access like
changing the network adapter checking
what kind of uh what kind of external
devices are being connected from a
system perspective all those things you
will require to run continuously so
instead of writing sudo again and again
and again for every command what you can
use this command
now what this will do is it will change
the terminal which is the user in this
particular terminal tab to a root user
now I will just press enter and you can
see you can check this dollar sign here
once I press on sudo SEO this will
change to a hash and you can see the
user has changed now from the simply
learn to the root user which basically
has all the permissions to do whatever
it can with the system it can change
into hash so now whatever you have to do
you don't have to write pseudo command
anymore and just write candidate Shadow
and there you go now remember this uh
root user terminal is only valid for
this particular tab not even this window
this particular tab if I go to this tab
here or I'll just close it and create a
new tab
it's still not dollar and where you and
just simply learn user anyway you can't
log in directly to the root usage for
security purposes like let's say if
while it is ultra rare for Linux to have
any kind of malware it is always better
to not give it all the permissions like
you can have in some other operating
system like Windows so you have to dial
into root directly okay so you can use
sudo command uh you don't have to use to
recommend if you have the sudo SU
a lot of the things uh sometimes you'll
find commands that will not work like
the cat TC Shadow they will not work or
sometimes the commands will work but
they won't work all the way you'll find
something is wrong so always make it a
point to try it with sudo once before
moving forward
so now let's understand how we can
navigate the file system in Linux so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open the terminal again just increase
the size of the texture value
so as you can see uh the still symbol
this means we're at the home location to
understand how we can determine which
directory we are in currently they
always remember terminal will open in a
particular directory that's the entire
point of the terminal or the command
line for example to find out what you
are in right now you can just type in
the command PWD which stands for present
working directory click enter and you
can see I'm at the home folder in the
simpler now this can obviously change
for example if I want to move somewhere
else now I'll just open the file manager
and show you once
this is the home simply run folder as
you can see it is written here Tona is
the name of the file manager this is the
home folder now you have desktop
documents downloads music all these
folders subfolders you can say inside
the similar folder home folder so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to move to
let's say the documents folder okay so
the command for that would be CD which
is change directory so I'm going to
write as you can see it will
automatically try to complete the more
you use color Linux and actually most of
the Linux operating systems the shell or
The Terminal understands where you go
and what you do all those things so that
way I will going to change the directory
to the let's say the documents folder
now we're going to just write CD
documents
and as you can see there is an extra
word here the documents which means that
now you are in the documents we can use
PWD command again to check and you can
see home simpler documents now what if
you're at a position where you don't
know where uh you are and what are the
files that are present there for example
I just opened this in the graphical user
interface and founded that okay these
are the subfolders that I can get into
to understand what are the folders
available at your particular location
the command is just listing for command
is LS press enter okay this is the
documents apologies we'll just to go
back one step right now we are in home
simply learned documents to go back a
single step will just write CD double
dot double full stop then
you can see once again we are back to
home simply learn now once again to
understand what are the folders that are
present we have to use the command LS
and as you can see you can see
everything that is present the desktop
document downloads music which is all
those folders can pop up now you can
move here and there based on where you
want to go
apart from this let's say if you want to
create a new folder for your own one
thing we can do is mkdir that command
stands for make directory now if I want
to create a new folder by the name of
mkdir SLP now remember make sure you
understand which position we are at
which is right now whom simply learn
based on the last PWD I haven't used CD
command anything after that so now if I
press LS you can see another folder in
the name of SLP now you can do the same
things you can just go to SLP you can
see the path has now changed to home
simple learn SLP you can go back and
that's how you can work and create
folders to delete let's say I don't want
to have the sap folder anymore I'll just
use rmdir SLP
now if I check LS we don't have that
folder anymore so that's how you work in
between folders
now one more thing that you can do is
just clear and it will clear up the
terminal for you now just to check where
we are again home simply learn now
remember seeing the cat folder right uh
the cat for uh sorry the cat command
using the ETC folder and the shadow file
now let's say if I want to see what is
inside the ETC file for example if I
just put down LS it will only show me
what the the folders present in my
present working directory what I can do
is I can just write LS
Etc
and these are the folders that are
present in the ETC folder so you can
check other files listings here as well
and directly giving the full path so
that will ignore the current working
director the present working directory
and show the folders present in the path
that you mentioned
okay apart from that one more thing that
we need to know when it comes to listing
out details is the LA command now
all of these commands is LS PWD at least
90 of the commands that you're going to
use in the Linux terminal I just clear
this for now 90 of the commands that you
use in Linux will have sub commands or
uh it is also called as flags that go
along with it now for example in my
current present working directly if I
press on LS
I get these folders right but these are
not the only folders that are presented
these are the only folders that are
being shown now to see the other files
and folders that are present in the home
folder I can write the normal command Ls
I'm going to add a sub command or a flag
if you say hyphen la
and you can see there are much more than
the desktop documents downloads that's
something that we were already seeing
here but apart from that you can see
other files and folders here the dot
cache Dot config.logout
everything you can see now everything
that has a DOT or full stop before it is
considered a hidden file it's not going
to show up directly using LS you have to
write the LA command which will show all
the files now it's very important to
understand these sub commands and what
are the flags that can be used in
different purposes yeah this is
basically the shell so the more research
you do and understand what kind of likes
that you can use it's going to be easier
what can help here is the man command
the man basically stands for manual you
can find it in every Linux actually
let's say you want to learn what are the
flags that you can use with the ls
command for example or you just want to
know what that command is so you can
just type in man LS
and you see it basically says L stands
for list directory contents this is a
description
here you can see all this sub commands
the flags minus B minus D there's a good
explanation for every single sub command
that you can use in order to navigate to
the file system or just listing this is
just for LS command you can do this with
almost any command that you want
it says once you are once you've read
what you needed to know just press Q to
quit
and there you have it so that's all
about how to list commands are list
folders and navigate through file
systems using CD mkdir and rfdir
now above the commands that you saw and
all the folders that you were able to
see let's say if I just press LSL a
you can see there is a folder called
dot cache right so to enter the file you
also need to just use the Siri command
you can see the present working director
has changed you can just press press
lscr and see if anything else yes you
can see there are other folders here as
well so the entire process Remains the
Same but just understand that if there
are some files and folders that you're
not able to see which is going to happen
a lot considering a lot of the things
that are hidden in Linux by default you
can access all of those things but you
need to know the right commands and the
right way to access them so if you are
missing out on some files and folders
just make sure you can uh you're using
the ls command and sometimes say when
the LA command to get the details of
everything that you are missing now this
folder currently doesn't have as such
any a lot of missing files and folders
like the home folder had so right now
it's not very indicative but you get the
full idea of it another thing that you
can use apart from the let's say the man
command is the hell command help hyphen
hyphen help
this is a small this is not as detailed
as man and this doesn't work for all
commands but you can do a lot of the
commands I if you need a quick answer to
something you can definitely check this
out which is the hyphen hyphen help
so while we are clear about folders like
how to manipulate folders let's take a
look about how we're going to work with
files for example now let's say uh if
you use the echo command Echo command is
the equivalent of trying to put
something on screen so let's say if I
just press Echo with the codes it just
print out hello if I want to put it
inside a file I'll just say
yeah
just press Ctrl 0 I'll just pray Echo
hello to autocomplete just press the
right arrow on your keyboard it will
order complete uh after that Echo hello
I want to put this into a file let's say
uh my file
Dot txt
yes uh we'll do one thing this is
currently in the cache folder right
we'll just go back
yes this is the home folder so we're
going to do the same thing here now to
go back to our history of comments I
want to do the same thing I want to Echo
hello into our new file so I'll just
press the up Arrow and it will go cycle
through my recent commands so I'll just
press enter
and if I just press SLS now you can see
in the home folder there's a new file of
MiFi dot text okay if I want to let's
say move this file to one of these
folders let's say I want to move this to
the video folders so the command for
that is c p which is copy I will copy
the my file
dot text to the videos folder
so I'll just enter I don't need to
actually enter videos to see the files
like we had discussed so what we're
going to do is I'm going to just type in
LS videos
and you can see it has the my file.txt
folder since I copied it obviously the
home folder will also have the my file
text in order to remove the my file text
I have to use the RM command remember to
move directories we used rmdir to remove
files we just have to use RM so I'm
going to use RM my file dot text to
delete the file now if I LS the home
folder does not have but since it had in
the I had copied uh kept a copying the
videos folder I'll press LS videos
press enter and you can see it still has
the my file command
okay now one more thing that we can need
to know is the
move command
the move command will essentially move
whatever folder wherever you want let's
say I want to create Ico hello my file
again I'll press LS and I'll see the
myfile.txt folder now if I want to move
this file let's say
if I use the MV command instead of the
CP command which is just for a I want to
use the my file.txt to let's say the
downloads folder
it's saying permission denied so what I
will do is I will click on sudo like we
discussed a lot of the things will not
work directly
we will use the same command
we'll use the downloads folder
till now work
it's time to take a look at users and
privileges now if you remember our LS
command
uh let's just check my present working
directory it's the home folder now if
you remember the minus L A you see a lot
of the
characters here which is the rwxr all
those things now this is basically to
understand what folder or what
permissions a user has if you check here
there are folders and files you can see
the folders in the dark blue color and
the files in the white color you can see
Light Blue for links well it's a
completely separate uh thing so another
thing the permissions part if you see
there are three groups here
this is a first group this is the second
group this is the third group the first
group is the owner of the file now what
permissions does the owner have now for
example right now the owner of let's say
this one uh this way for example is root
most of the time it will be the user but
this time it is root it has a read write
execute R for read W for right and X for
execute obviously the owner will be able
to do all those things now the second
group is basically for anyone who is
part of the
domain group in the users like if you
remember while installing that it was a
option called Creator domain why we did
not create it because we don't have a
lot of users right now but when you
create a domain what are the people in
the group who are going to do so they
have the read function which is the RX
for execute but they do not have the
right function they cannot write
directly in this file
similarly for the third Group which is
anyone outside of the so any other user
if they are not in a particular group of
the file then they also have the read
function and the execute function but
they will not be able to write into the
file directly so that's how you can
check all of the files that are able to
that a user can access or not access
that's basically the entire purpose of
the uh the privilege section because we
don't want to give undue permission to a
people who do not require it the entire
point of security in Linux is to be is a
level of abstraction that is providing
users with exactly what they are needed
so if you have a user that does not
require executable functions to let's
say the downloads folder we can cut it
off from our as a root user anyway
so that's about providing Privileges and
providing access to certain files
like we had discussed the ETC Shadow
file that we had are used when checking
the cad file now one more thing that we
can do again is understanding what the
shadow file does if you just press cat e
to C Shadow obviously it will not work
it will just say permission denied we're
going to say sudo cat shadow
this basically has the password hashes
for all the users that are in a system
right now you can see the root head does
not have a hash because it's not safe to
have a particular hash for a user just
from security perspective uh we the the
user that we have created which is
simply learn you can see the password
hash being mentioned here now depends on
how many users you get if you create
three four five users you can see all
the password hashes here now you can so
if the why this is password protected by
security and we need to use the sudo
user command is because if someone has
this hash let's say if someone is a
cryptographer and is able to Brute Force
through hashes then it's very it's going
to be very easy to try and figure out
the passwords to particular users
passwords that's why even the hash is
not shown with uh full confidence unless
and until they get the pseudo user
command
so that's about uh you know Privileges
and how you can use the Surah command to
bypass the normal user limits so now
let's take a look at some of the
networking commands we're going to clear
this one for now
uh check the adapters that we have in
use right now
you can just write if config or actually
IPA uh sorry not c i p a
similar information IPA is a newer
variant it basically shows what other
adapters and the networking conditions
right now for example you can see
ethernet now even though I am using
Wi-Fi on my local system
uh in network address translation which
is the NAT that we set the network
package manager when setting up the
virtual machine virtual machine on this
VMware it will link up as ethernet so
you can see ethernet you can check our
local address you can check our credit
for subnet
this is our broadcast address and this
is our Mac address for the system this
is the IPv6 address as well now
similarly
uh this can be checked on whichever
system you are being connected to the
IPA ifconfig is the same it's just uh an
older variant apart from this there is
another command actually I W config now
this is particularly for wireless oh
sorry that was a wrong spelling I have I
double config now right now it will not
show any Wireless extensions if you are
looking into Wireless sniffing uh the
network package detection or even
Wireless hacking for example we will
publish a video on wireless hacking soon
so stay tuned for that apart from apart
from Wireless hacking if you are using
any Wireless extensions let's say we
have small adapters that people can use
as Portables or wireless cards for Wi-Fi
for some systems they do not have Wi-Fi
enabled and ICS in their motherboards
the people use modifiable custom uh
portable
adapters so if you have one of those
plugged in you will see it in IW config
from ifconfig you will only may be able
to find out the IP address and that's it
iwconfig will give you all the
information and you can check later
coming to different IP addresses are
command that you should be knowing is
arp
now if you are not familiar with ARP
that is going to be address resolution
protocol I think ipn will also show the
same information so what both of these
do is it basically states which IP
address relates to what Mac address it
will also show which one is reachable
which one is stable all those extra now
remember whatever is being done in these
kind of uh IP addresses and Mac
addresses all of them need to be put in
a routing table if you want to connect
with each other now how you can check
that just enter route and you can see
the routing table for this particular
system you can see there is a
destination for every IP address there's
an open Gateway there is a mask here
all of this stuff whatever database they
needs to travel in between host now the
second host let's say from this virtual
machine I want to travel I I want the to
communicate with a system that is in my
similar voice in the same Wi-Fi network
then that must be a routing table
connection between them this can uh the
example that I gave the same WiFi
network thing that will mostly be handed
by the modem or the router basically but
what if it's not what if there's a this
is two systems and they're not having
any other correction and it just had to
happen to have a uh align cable
connected between them you have to set
these routing tables manually so that
you are able to communicate this is
going to be expressly useful if you're
setting up in a domain group authorities
and all those things but apart from that
it's just a good thing to know how
networking works now all of these
commands this Mac addresses these IP
addresses these are something that are
of utmost importance so learning
networking when learning Linux is very
essential I highly suggest learn
networking so that you can be able to
grasp these things better now based on
how we can communicate with particular
host addresses there is a command if you
want to check if you can reach a
particular host or not that is using the
Ping command now we'll take a common
example for this because I don't have
any other system in the uh
vicinity Network right now so let's say
if I want to go let's I want to see if I
have connection to google.com now you
can use directly an IP address as well
I'm just going to check ping google.com
and you can see it will start pinging
request directly from the google.com
whichever is the nearest server that
Google has
set
you can see it just says that it did
it's N64 bytes from this particular IP
address it received an icmp request was
sent
the time it took for each request is
also mentioned at the end here 15 ms16
Ms 17 18 all the SMS now since we are
getting a particular request back ICB
basically require uh needs a response if
we are getting a response then that host
is reachable if I did not have internet
right now this would not be possible
I'll just show I'll press Ctrl C
whatever whatever command is being run
if you want to stop it on the next
terminal it is best to uh it is Ctrl C
okay just press Ctrl C I will it will
give us small report here as well it
says 51 package transmitted 50 receive
how much packet loss was there if some
of the requests did not go through or
did not receive a response uh how much
time it was taken all those things I'm
going to clear and what I'm going to do
I'm going to disconnect
yes the network connection has been
disconnected now if I put ping.google
um sorry ping dot google.com
temporary failure in name resolution as
simple as that so once I connect again
that sounded pretty straightforward
apart from using uh domain names you can
also use IP addresses like we mentioned
now another IP address that we can ping
for sure since we have internet
connection is cloudflare's DNS
resolution address now that would be
ping
1.1.1.1 now but uh to have to understand
DNS it's basically acts as an address
book for all the websites that you see
in whichever way it may be for example
if let's say we're reaching google.com
when we paint google.com we saw this IP
address responding a request we didn't
saw google.com particularly responding
to requests right these IP address will
depend based on what uh what DNA
Services Google has and what can how
many servers they have in particular
locations that's why
uh hitting IP address directly also work
that's why DNS is essential so we're
going to bring 1.1.1.1
and you can see we're getting response
times for those as well now these will
be generally faster compared to normal
you know websites
as you can see the time is much less
compared to pinging google.com Okay uh
obviously if you can't Target something
let's say one point one point two point
five for example
I'm not sure if that is even a host
100 practical loss it's just uh
nothing worked
it will not work it won't send anything
even if there is a host let's say if I
have an IP address of a system that is
in my group but it does not have
permission to receive IPP request or it
has just closed off all the ports that
we cannot connect with it then it will
just not work it will just say it's not
existing
you see we sent 26 packets none of them
were received and it was a 100 bracket
loss
that's why I'll just check once what is
the IP address of our system plus
192.168 72.130 if I
192 168
782.0130 I'll just play 154 or something
there is no host there was another
address there it would have received
some request and since there is no host
it says destination host unreachable
that's how you can check if you have
connectivity with the particle Sir with
a particular system in your network or
your group or your domain using the
thing command so that's the networking
commands that all the networking
commands that you need to know for now
the basics at the very least
the next thing you have to take a look
at is services
the services will differ widely based on
the system that you are using for
example on Windows you see services for
defense stuff like for any remote extra
software you check and you see services
similar cases with Linux if I just open
let's say h top
okay let's now we have to install it
stop let's just stop here it basically
functions the top functions as a task
manager you can see so many systems
Services here like song tonar access top
is running on the background stuff like
that now if I want to start something
particular let's take the Apache web
server now Apache web servers have been
in use for like the years decades at
this point so in order to function uh
see how Apache server is used the first
thing I am going to check is my
IP address this is my IP address
so what I'll do is I will copy this I'll
open my web browser Apache web servers
are hosted on your own IP so I'll just
paste it here and click enter
and you can see there's nothing popping
up now a major reason can this for this
can be the server is not running so one
thing what we'll do is we're going to
start the Apache server by starting its
service so we're going to use system
foreign
click enter
it will say it just not work what I will
do is uh sorry this correct term was
service not system and even if I click
on service
Apache to start
it will say it needs authentication now
this could be bypass by directly giving
sudo and putting in the root password in
the command line itself but all in all
it's the same result so I'll just use my
password Here
and now I just remove the HTTP here
because Apache is a local server
now you can see the Apache web server
has loaded based on Apache between
different the remain default please now
as you can see
the server is working correctly
if I just open the terminal again now to
stop it I can once again just goes row
service Apache to stop this will stop
the service I'll just press enter
I'll refresh and there will user access
a very good part of our purchase servers
used to be the ability to hold files
ability to host files basically for
people in the same domain or even the
same network
okay now you can see where the files can
be stored like for example it says you
should replace this file located at
where HTML
index.html so if I just open up a file
explorer
go to file system
where
www.html this is where a lot of people
can post their files okay now another
better way is to hold up python server
now considering all of Linux come almost
every single Linux distribution now
comes with python pre-installed so how
we can do that is
uh let that keep running we don't have
an issue
I'll just check
no actually let's stop that it will be
easier to understand how it's working
if we refresh now as you can see nothing
is working so what we're going to do is
we're going to start
a python HTTP server
python is used to python minus m is the
sub flag for it and HTTP server we're
going to start now what is my present
working directory
simpler let me just clear these present
worker directory is the home folder if
you check what are the folders that are
available desktop documents these are
the folders now if I am running the HTTP
server on this folder even though it
will only my IP is going to be used for
accessing the server it depends on which
folder I'm hosting it from so if I host
the python HTTP server
wait uh python HTTP server from this
folder I just press enter and you can
say it says serving HTTP on 060 is
basically your local IP address
and I'm using the port 80. you can use
whichever Port that's not really
important which port to use file refresh
now you can see I see all the folders
that are available documents downloads
these DOT hours something other things
that we've already seen using the minus
l a comma so all the files are now
hosted properly as expected similarly
if we want to use let's say any other
files that we want to share with someone
in a network uh easily and this can very
well function like an FTP server this is
not exactly FTP server but this can be
easily accessed with just the URL
someone is in my system and someone is
in my home network for example they can
just use my IP address which will be
192.16870 to 130 they can check the pink
command and see if it is reachable which
it should be unless until some
particular Port is closed they can just
access the files using this one now to
stop the python HTTP server once again
just press Ctrl C
and
so on so that's how you work with
services in college index at least from
a basic perspective that's how it's
going to work
and one of the last things that we're
going to check is the ability to install
update tools and basically all the
software that you can see here you see
all the applications
that can be run for example the
vulnerability analysis tools nmap SQL
map River
pixie WPS all those things now how do
these get installed updated and
basically dealt with so PT actually apt
get also but uh those are
interchangeable and you can use
whichever one you like I use apt get
but in order to check let's say if you
want to update a system which is one of
the bare minimum needs of every system
right so the command for that is going
to be so uh first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to use sudo Su which is the
sudo super user I will just use sudo SU
and go into the root stage because
almost all of the commands that I'm
going to put next require sudo so I
might as well just be without having to
type the password every single time now
once I'm sure I assume the correct
command would be apt get
update now what this will do is it will
check the repositories every link
distribution has a few repositories that
it gets the softwares and updates from
it will check the package lists now for
now the repository that is being hit is
the correct or download Kali rolling in
release right so it will update the
repositories based on the data available
on that particular address we use the
APD get update Commander so next thing
what we are going to do is apt get
upgrade
yes so now after the repositories have
been updated with the data available on
the web server it says that the
following packages will be upgraded you
can see the Apache 2 server needs an
update then you have CS certificate
script setup Firefox ESR which is a
Firefox browser for extended support
release Linux platforms all those things
the Misa Vulcan drivers python python
flash all those things out of total 303
upgraded no new installations are needed
and four need not be upgraded so after
this operation you'll see 364 MB of
files needs to be downloaded and 24 MBA
additional displays will be used you can
either continue using y or n so let's
say you're going to update your system
now if I just even if I click n and be
done with that this is all about
updating I'm going to clear this out but
how do we install files for example if
you remember I typed out a command
called H top it says command stop not
found but can be installed with apt
install H top that can once again be apt
get as well it's not a very big deal
which one do you use I just cancel this
and I will write out the command myself
I will use let's use apt for this one
instead of APD cat APD install at shop
now I am able to do this very easily
because it stop is already in the
repository I have uh that in the Kali
enrolling release repository that's why
as you can see the installation has been
started
this is the the fetched 152 KB which is
the size of edge shop it's a very small
thing and the installation is now
complete now if I just sit on edge top
you can see a newer version of the
without
the task manager or the system monitor
essentially to see what where the memory
is being usage the CPU percentage all
those things so that's how you can
install if I press Ctrl C again I'll go
back to my command line interface so
that's how you can install
either to remove
you can just use apt remove HTTP it says
want to remove and 387 kilobyte disk
will be freed if I just press enter we
don't have a stop anymore so that's how
you install and remove tools from Kali
Linux using the APT and APD CAD now
these apt and APK are package manager
specifically for Debian and Debian based
operating systems that's why these
commands will transition will be
consistent across all dbm based
Distribution Systems unless and until
they have their own package manager
which is not really the case if they are
based on DBL so similarly if a dollar
has enf Arch has Pac-Man all those
things so those will differ but if in a
particular
um in a particular base distribution
these package managers will be the same
so that's how you can use apt and EPT
get to understand how you can install
and remove tools with cyber crime
getting more and more complex by the day
corporations are in the need of trained
Personnel in the field of cyber security
ethical hacking and penetration testing
had always been necessary for
organizations and the general public to
protect the system against malicious
attackers
however with the exponential growth in
cyber attacks the necessity of being
trained in ethical hacking is at an
all-time high
many such professionals tend to use
Linux distributions for their
penetration testing activities
there are specific operating systems
which are catered to ethical hackers
these operating systems come
pre-installed with the necessary tools
and scripts required for ethical hacking
probably the most famous operating
system in this bracket is Kylie Linux
for today's video we will learn about
this distribution made by and for
hackers
we take you through the intricacies of
its hardware and software specifications
let's take a look at the agenda for
today
we start by learning about Kali Linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of Kali
Linux from the story of its origin to
its current day exploits
next we learn a few distinct features of
Karl Linux that make it an attractive
choice for penetration testers worldwide
moving on we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install Kali Linux to start
a journey in the world of penetration
testing
in the next few sections We compare it
to an industry rival operating system by
the name of parrot security operating
system
we take a look at the OS on our
Grassroots level
next we learn about the standout
features of Kali Linux and parrot
security with their unique offerings
we make a direct comparison between Kali
and parrot security OS as far as the
hardware specifications and all around
usability is concerned we make a
conclusion as to which operating system
caters to which category of user
in the next topic we take a detailed
look at how we can install Kali Linux on
a Windows 10 system using the VMware
virtualization software
moving on we go through some of the
reasons why people should choose Kali
Linux as their primary operating system
when it comes to ethical hacking and
penetration testing
in the next section we cover the five
different phases of penetration testing
where each stage is a crucial segment in
the entire cycle for ethical hacking
campaign
we also take a look at the most popular
tools installed in Karl Linux that are
used regularly by ethical hackers as a
part of their professional work
coming to a few live demonstrations we
start by learning some Linux terminal
basic commands set up proxy chains to
maintain a privacy on the Internet run a
few nmap scans to find information about
our victims use Wireshark to detect
insecure browser traffic traveling
through HTTP web pages
learn about Metasploit and its
components
and finally use Metasploit to hack into
a Windows 10 machine and Grant ourselves
root access or the admin access which
basically gives us the key to the entire
machine
it's no secret that the majority of our
internet usage set the risk of being
hacked be it via unsafe messaging
applications or misconfigured operating
systems counteract this void of digital
security penetration testing has become
the knob when it comes to vulnerability
assessment Kali Linux is an operating
system that has become a well-known
weapon in this fight against hackers a
Linux distribution that is made
specifically for penetration testers
Kali Linux has layers of features that
we will be covering in today's lesson
let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in this video
we start by learning about Kali Linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of Carl
Linux from the story of its origin to
its current day exploits
next we learn a few distinct features of
Kali that make it an attractive choice
for penetration testers worldwide
finally we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install Kali Linux to start
a journey in the world of penetration
testing
let's start by learning about Kali Linux
in general
Kali Linux which is formerly known as
backtrack Linux is an open source Linux
distribution aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools that
are targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
Kali Linux is a multiple platform
solution accessible and freely available
to Information Security Professionals
and hobbyists
among all the Linux distributions Kali
Linux takes its routes from the Debian
operating system
Debian has been a highly dependable and
stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong Foundation
to the Kali desktop
while the operating system is capable of
practically modifying every single part
of our installation the networking
components of Kali become disabled by
default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments apart from
boosting security it allows a deeper
element of control to the most
enthusiastic of users
we did not get Kali Linux since the
first day how did it come into existence
let's take a look at some of its history
Linux is based on years of knowledge and
experience in building penetration
testing and operating systems during all
these project lifelines there have been
only a few different developers as the
team has always been small the first
project was called wapix which stands
for white hat and Opex as can be
inferred from the name it was based on
the nopex operating system as its
underlying OS Optics had releases
ranging from version 2.0 to 2.7
this made way for the next project which
was known as wax or the long hand being
white hat slacks the name change was
because the base OS was changed from
nopics to slacks wax started at version
3 as a Nord at carrying on from mop X
there was a similar OS being produced at
the same time auditor security
collection often being shorted to just
auditor which was once again using
nopics
its efforts were combined with wax to
produce backtrack
backtrack was based on slackware from
version 1 to version 3 but switched to
Ubuntu later on with version 4 to
version 5. using the experience gained
from all of this Kal Linux came after
backtrack in 2013. Kali started off
using Debian stable as the engine under
the hood before moving to Debian testing
when Kali Linux became a rolling
operating system
now that we understand the history and
the purpose of Kali Linux let us learn a
little more about its distinct features
the latest version of Kali comes with
more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed after reviewing every tool
that was included in backtrack
developers have eliminated a great
number of tools that either simply did
not work or which duplicated other tools
that provided the same or similar
functionality
the Kali Linux team is made up of a
small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols restricting access of critical
code basis to external asset greatly
reduces the risk of source contamination
which can cause Kali Linux users
worldwide a great deal of damage as a
direct victim of cybercrime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in English the developers have
ensured that Kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in their native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since RBS single board systems like the
Raspberry Pi are becoming more and more
prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
Kali Linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has arm repositories
integrated with the mainland
distributions so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
all this information is necessary for
users to determine if Kali Linux is the
correct choice for them if it is what
are the ways that they can go forward
with this installation and start their
penetration testing Journey
the first way to use Kali Linux is by
launching the distribution in the live
USB mode this can be achieved by
downloading the installer image file or
the ISO file from the Kali Linux website
and flashing it to a USB drive with a
capacity of at least 8 GB
some people don't need to save the data
permanently and a live USB is the
perfect solution for such cases after
the iso image is flashed the thumb drive
can be used to boot a fully working
installation of the operating system
with the caviar that any changes made to
the OS in this mode are not written
permanently some cases allow persistent
usage in live USPS but those require
further configuration than normal
situations
but what if the user wants to store data
permanently in the installed OS the best
and the most reliable way to ensure this
is the full-fledged hardness
installation this will ensure the
complete usage of the system's Hardware
capabilities and will take into account
the updates and the configurations being
made to the OS this method is supposed
to overwrite any pre-existing operating
system installed on the computer be it
windows or any other variant of Linux
the next alternative route for
installing Kali Linux would be to use
virtualization software such as VMware
or virtualbox the software will be
installed as a separate application on
an already existing OS and Kali Linux
can be run as an operating system in the
same computer as a window
the hardware requirements will be
completely customizable starting with
the allotted Ram to the virtual hard
disk capacity
the usage of both a host and guest
operating system like car Linux allows
users a safe environment to learn while
not putting the systems at risk if you
want to learn more about how one can go
forward with this method we have a
dedicated video where Kali Linux is
being installed on VMware while running
on a Windows 10 operating system you can
find the link in the description box to
get started with your very own virtual
machine
the final way to install Kali Linux is
by using a dual boot system to put it in
simple words the Kali Linux OS will not
be overrating any pre-installed
operating system on a machine but will
be installed alongside it when a
computer boots up the user will get a
choice to boot into either of these
operating systems many people prefer to
keep both the windows and Kali Linux
installed so the distribution of work
and recreational activities is also
allotted effectively it gives users a
safety valve should their custom Linux
installation run into any bugs that
cannot be fixed from within the
operating system
Professionals in security testing
penetration testing and ethical hacking
utilize Linux as their preferred
operating system
provides several configurable
distributions that mu May configure
based on your end use
Kali Linux and parrot os are two popular
penetration testing distributions
while these operating systems each have
unique offerings the overall Choice can
differ between Personnel thanks to the
various tools and Hardware
specifications
today we will look at both these
distributions and settle on the perfect
choice for each type of user let's go to
the agenda for this video
we will learn about Kali Linux and
pirate security Os from scratch while
understanding their primary selling
points as a Linux distribution catered
towards penetration testers
next we know about some features of
these operating systems that stand out
of their package
finally we directly compare Carl Linux
and private security OS thereby making a
clear-cut conclusion on which OS is
perfect on a per requirement basis
so let's start by learning about Carl
Linux from a ground level
Kal Linux which is formerly known as
backtrack Linux is an open source Linux
distribution aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools
targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
Kali Linux is a multi-platform solution
accessible and freely available to
Information Security Professionals and
hobbyists
among all the Linux distributions Kali
Linux takes its rules from the Debian
operating system
Debian has been a highly dependable and
a stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong Foundation
to the Kali Linux desktop
while the operating system can
practically modify every single part of
our installation the networking
components of Kali Linux come disabled
by default
this is done to prevent any external
factors from affecting the installation
procedure which may pose a risk in
critical environments apart from
boosting security it allows a more
profound element of security control to
the most enthusiastic of users
now let's take a look at parent security
operating system
parent security OS is a Debian based red
Max distribution with an emphasis on
security privacy and development
it is built on the demian's testing
branch and uses a custom hardened Linux
kernel
parrot security contains several hundred
tools targeted towards tasks such as
penetration testing computer forensics
reverse engineering and security
research it is seen as a generally
lightweight distribution that can work
under rigorous hardware and software
specifications
it features a distinct forensics mode
that does not Mount any of the system's
hard disks or partitions and has no
influence on the host system making it
much more stealthy than its regular
occurrence this mode is used on the host
system to execute forensic procedures
a rolling release is a paradigm in which
software upgrades are rolled out
constantly rather than in batches of
versions in software development this
ensures that the software is constantly
up to date a rolling release
distribution such as pirate security OS
follows the same concept
it provides the most recent Linux kernel
and software versions as soon as they
become available
with the basic introduction to the
operating systems out of the way let us
take a look at the unique features of
both Kali Linux and parrot security OS
the latest version of Kali Linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed after reviewing every tool
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a significant number of tools
that either simply did not work or
duplicated other tools that provided the
same and similar functionality
the Kali Linux team comprises a small
group of individuals who are the only
ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external assets dramatically
reduces the risk of source contamination
which can cause Kali Linux users
worldwide a great deal of damage as a
direct victim of cyber crime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in English the developers have
ensured that Kali includes proper
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for their job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since arm-based single board systems
like the Raspberry Pi are becoming more
prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
Kali Linux is available on a wide range
of ERM devices and has ERM repositories
integrated with the mainline
distribution so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
let's take a look at some of the
features of parrot security operating
system now
along with a giant catalog of scripts
parent security OS has its own Hardware
Linux kernel modified explicitly to
provide as much security and resistance
to hackers as possible in the first line
of defense
the configurations in the operating
system act as the second Gateway taking
care of malicious requests and dropping
them off this is particularly beneficial
since should there be a scenario where
the latex Linux kernel is causing some
particular issue the parrot OS
development team will most likely iron
it out first before passing it on as an
update
if the custom Hardware kernel was
increasing enough parent security
developers managed to install more
hacking tools and scripts to ensure a
smooth transition for the Kali Linux
users all the tools you find in Kali are
present in parent to us and a few extra
ones for good measure
and this has been achieved while keeping
roughly the same operating system size
between both of them
however it's not all productivity points
for parrot OS they provide a choice
between two different desktop
environments made which comes
pre-installed by default and KDE
for those unfamiliar with Linux
terminology you can think of desktop
environments as the main UI for a
distribution
being highly modular in nature one can
use parrot security OS while adding
another desktop environment that they
find appealing while car Learners has
only a single option pirate security has
provided two optimized builds with made
desktop and KDE desktop
one of the primary advantages of parrot
OS over Kali Linux is that it's
relatively lightweight this implies that
it takes significantly less disk space
and computing power to function
correctly with as little as 320 MB of
ram required in reality Paradise is
designed to operate successfully of a
USB stick but Kali Linux does not work
well from a USB drive and is generally
installed in a virtual machine
parrot OS is more of a niche
distribution if you are searching for
something lighter than College X
features are great but what about
Performance Real World metrics let us
compare both these operating systems
directly with respect to their Hardware
specifications and usability
in the end we can decide on what
distribution is fit for each type of
user
for a first point of comparison let's
take a look at the ram required
for Optimum performance of the operating
system which is highly essential when
trying to crack hashes or something of
similar nature Prime usage is a very
important facet while College Linux
demands at least 1GB of ram Barrel
security can operate optimally with a
minimum of 320 MB of RAM
for correctly displaying graphical
elements Kali Linux requires GPU based
acceleration while this is not the case
with parrot security OS which doesn't
require any graphical acceleration
needed from the user side
once these operating systems are
installed on VMware using the live boot
isos
they take up a minimum amount of hard
disk storage both of these operating
systems have a recommended disk storage
of minimum of 20 GB in Kali Linux and a
minimum of 15 GB in parrot security so
they can install all the tools necessary
in the ISO file
when it comes to the category and the
selection of tools Carl Linux has always
been the first in securing every single
tool available for hackers in the
penetration testing industry
Parish Security on the other hand has
managed to take it up a notch
while specializing in Wireless pen
testing parrot security makes it a point
that all the tools that Kali Linux
provides has been included in the iso
while simultaneously adding some extra
tools that many users will have to
install from third-party sources in Kali
Linux
being a decade role penetration testing
distribution Kali Linux has formed up a
very big Community with strong support
signature parent Security on the other
hand is still growing and it is
garnering much more interest among
veteran penetration testers and ethical
hackers
a primary drawback of Kali Linux is the
extensive Hardware requirement
to perform optimally it requires higher
memory than private security it also
needs graphical acceleration while
demanding more virtual hard disk storage
pirate Security on the other hand was
initially designed to run off a USB
drive directly thereby requiring very
minimal requirements from a hardware
perspective like just 320 MB of RAM and
no graphical acceleration needed this
means parrot security is much more
feasible for people who are not able to
devote massive resources to either their
virtual machine or on their laptop hard
disk directly
with the comparison done between both of
these operating systems let's take a
look at the type of users both of these
are catered to
one can go with color Linux if they want
the extensive Community Support offered
by its users if they want to go with a
trusted development team that have been
working on this distribution since many
years
if they have a powerful system which can
run Kali Linux optimally without having
to bottleneck performance
and if they are comfortable with a
semi-professional environment which may
or may not be very useful for new
beginners
one can decide to go with parrot
security if they want to go with a very
lightweight ending distribution that can
run pretty much on all systems
it also has a lot of tools pre-installed
and some of them are not even present on
car Linux
it is much more suitable for
underpowered rigs where users do not
have a lot of Hardware resources to
provide to the operating system and
thereby it is much more feasible for
people with underpowered laptops or no
graphical acceleration
compared to Kali Linux parrot Security's
desktop environment is also relatively
easier to use for new beginners
for people who are just getting into
ethical hacking pilot security does a
relatively better job of introducing
them to the operating system and the
various tools without having to dump
them into the entire intricacies the
installation of Kali Linux there are
multiple ways to install Kali Linux we
can either install it on a normal hard
drive in a virtual machine software such
as VMware or virtualbox or we can do
that in hard bare metal machines now for
the convenience of explanation we're
going to install Kali Linux today on a
virtual machine software known as VMware
VMware is able to run multiple operating
systems on a single host machine which
in our case is a Windows 10 system
to get started with Kali Linux
installation we have to go to the
website to download an image file
we go to get Kali and as you can see
there are multiple platforms on which
this operating system can be inverted as
per our requirement we're going to go
with the virtual machine section as you
can see it is already recommended by the
Developers
this is the download button which will
download a 64-bit ISO file we can
download 32-bit but that is more
necessary for hard metal machines or if
you're going to use it for older devices
which do not support 64-bit operating
systems yet
after clicking on the download button
we can see we have a window archive
which will have the ISO files
for now we have downloaded the ISO file
and it is already present with me so we
can start working on the VMware side of
things
once the ISO file is downloaded we open
up VMware Workstation
go to file
and we create a new virtual machine
in these two options it is highly
recommended to go with the typical setup
rather than the custom one the custom is
much more advanced and requires much
more information from the user which is
beneficial for developers and people who
are well versed with virtualization
software but from 90 of the cases
typical setup will be enough
here we can select the third option
which will be I will install the
operating system later and some
operating systems we can use the ISO
file here directly and VMware will
install it for us but for right now in
the case of Kali Linux the third option
is always the safest
color Linux is a Linux distribution so
we can select Linux over here and the
version as you can see here I have
multiple versions such as the multiple
kernels
every distribution has a parent
distribution for example Kali Linux as
Debian and there are other distributions
which are based or forked from some
parent distribution columnist is based
off Debian so we can go with the highest
version of Debian which is the Debian
10.x 64-bit
go on next we can write any such name we
can write Kali Linux so that it will be
easier to recognize the virtual machine
among this list of virtual machine
instances the location can be any
location you decide to put by default
this should be the documents folder but
anywhere you put it will hold up all the
information of the operating system all
the files you download all the
configurations you store everything will
be stored in this particular location
that you provide
when we go next
we are asked about the disk capacity
this disk capacity will be all the
storage that will be provided to your
virtual machine of Cal Linux think of
your Windows device if you have a one
terabyte of hard drive you have the
entirety of the hard disk to store data
on how much data you give here you can
only store up to that amount of data not
to mention some amount of capacity will
be taken up by the operating system
itself to store its programs and
applications
for now we can give around let's say 15
GB of information or if a recommended
size for typing is 20 we can just go
ahead at 20. it depends on the user case
if you are going to use it extensively
you can even go as high as 50 or 60 GB
if you have plans to download many more
applications and perform multiple
different tests
another option we get over here is
storing virtual disk as a single file or
storing them into multiple files
as we already know this virtual machine
run entirely on VMware
sometimes when transferring these
virtual machine instances let's say from
a personal computer to a work computer
you're going to need to copy up the
entire folder that we had mentioned
before over here
instead all virtual machines have a
portability feature now this portability
feature is possible
for all scenarios except it is much
easier if the split the virtual disk
into multiple files now even if this
makes what porting virtual machines
easier from either system to system or
my software to software let's say if you
want to switch from VMware to virtualbox
or vice versa the performance takes a
small hit it's not huge but it's
recommended to go with storing the
virtual disk as a single file if you
have no purposes of ever moving the
virtual machine even if you do it's not
a complete stop that it cannot be ported
it's just easier when using multiple
files but in order to get the best
performance out of the virtual machine
we can store it as a single file over
here
this is a summary of all the changes
that we made and all the configurations
that have been settled until now now at
this point of time we have not provided
the dot ISO file yet which is the
installation file for the Kali Linux
that we downloaded from this website
as of right now we have only configured
the settings of the virtual machine so
we can press on finish
and we have Kali Linux in the list now
to make the changes further we press on
edit virtual machine settings
the memory is supposed to give the ram
of the virtual machine
the devices with ram of 8GB or below
that giving high amount of ram will
cause performance issues and the host
system
if the memory has some amount of free
storage left let's say on idle storage
my Windows machine takes about 2GB so I
have 6 GB of memory to provide although
if you provide all of the 6gb it will be
much more difficult for the host system
to run everything properly so for this
instance we can keep it as 2GB of memory
for the virtual machine instance
similarly we can use the number of
processors and we can customize it
according to our liking let's say if we
want to use One processor but we want to
use two different cores we can select
them as well
hard disk is pre-set up as the SCSI hard
disk and it does not need to be changed
for the installation of this operating
system at all
cdid DVD this is where the installation
file comes you can think of the ISO file
that we downloaded as a pen drive or a
USB thumb drive which is necessary to
install an operating system to provide
this
we're going to select use ISO image file
we're going to click on browse
go on go to downloads and select the Im
so file over here
select open
and we can see it is already loaded up
next in the network adapter it is
recommended to use Nat this helps the
virtual machine to draw the internet
from the host machine settings if your
host machine is connected to the
internet then the virtual machine is
connected as well there are some other
options such as host only or custom
segments or Lan segments but those are
not necessary for installation
rest of them are pretty standard which
do not need any extra configuration and
can be left as it is
press OK and now we can power on this
virtual machine
okay
in this screen we can choose how we want
to proceed with the installation
we have a start installer option over
here
so we're going to press enter on that
we're going to wait for the things to
load from the ISO file
the first step in the installation is
choosing the language of the operating
system
for this we can go with English as
standard
this is a location this will be used for
setting up the time and some of the
internal settings which depend entirely
on the location of the user so for this
we're going to go with India
configuring the keyboard it's always
recommended to go with the American
English first many people make a mistake
of going with the Indian keyboard if it
is possible and it provides a lot of
issues later on so it's always prefer to
go with the American English and if
later we see some necessity of another
keyboard dialect deputiesness required
we can install it later but for now we
should always stick with American
English as a basic
at this point it's going to load the
installation components from the dot ISO
file it is a big file of 3.6 GB so it
has a lot of components that need to be
put into the virtual machine which can
also be used to detect Hardware
once the hardware and the network
configuration is done by the ISO file we
want to write a hostname for the system
this hostname can be anything which is
used to recognize this device on a local
network or a lan cable let's say if we
use the name Kali
domain name you we can skip it for now
it's not necessary as such for the
installation
this is the full name for the user
let's say we can provide the name as
simply learn as a full name
next you're going to set up a username
this username is going to be necessary
to identify the user from its use root
accounts and the subsequent below
accounts for now we can give it as
something as simply one two three
now we have to choose a password for the
user now remember since this is the
first user that is being added onto this
newly installed operating system it
needs to be a password for the
administrator
we can use whichever password we like
over here
and use the same password below and
press on continue
at this point it's going to detect on
the components on which the operating
system can be installed
like here
there are multiple options like the use
entire disk use entire disk and setup
lvm this entire disk can setup encrypted
lvm for newcomers it is recommended to
just use the first one since lvm
encryption is something that we can
learn afterwards when you are much more
Hands-On with the Linux operating system
for now we're going to use the use
entire disk guided installation and
press on continue
when we set up the virtual machine on
VMware we had set up a disk capacity
that we gave our preposition 20 GB that
is the hardest which is being discovered
here even though it is a virtual disk on
VMware it acts as a normal hard disk on
which an operating system can be
installed
so we select this one and press on
continue
here there is a multiple partition
system
all the operating systems that are
installed have different components one
is used for the keeping of the
applications one for the files other for
the RAM management and other things for
newcomers it is always recommended to
keep it in one partition
and we're going to select that and press
on continue
this is just an overview of the
partition it's going to make as you can
see it has a primary partition of 20.4
GB and a logical partition of 1GB used
for swap memory now these kind of naming
can be confusing for people who are not
well versed with Linux operating systems
or in general virtualization but for now
you can go ahead and press on continue
as this will be fine
we can press on finish partitioning and
write changes to disk and continue
it's just a confirmation page as you can
see it showed that SCSI 3 is our virtual
hard disk of 20gps disk capacity
we write the changes to the disk we
press yes and click on continue
at this point the installation has
started now this installation will take
a while depending on the num amount of
ram provided the processors provided and
how quickly the performance of the
system is being hampered by the host
machine on quick assistance this will be
rather quick while on the smaller ones
this will take a while
since this is going to take some time to
install as it is being run on a virtual
machine with only 2GB of RAM we're going
to speed up this part of the video so we
don't have to waste any more time just
watching the progress bar
now that our core installation is
completed it's asking us to configure a
package manager the work of a package
manager on Linux operating system is
similar to the Google Play Store on
Android mobile devices and on the app
store for the Apple devices
it's an interface to install external
applications which are not installed by
default let's say for Google Chrome or
any other browser which can be used to
browse the internet
at this point of time it's ask us to
select our Network mirror we're going to
select as yes and move forward with this
next
it's going to ask us for a HTTP proxy
which we can leave it as blank and press
it as continue forward
at this point of time it's looking for
updates to the Kali Linux installation
this will fetch the new builds from the
Kali server so the installation is
always updated to the latest version
now that the package manager is
configured we have the grub bootloader
the grub is used for selecting the
operating system while booting up its
core functionality is to allow the
operating system to be loaded correctly
without any faults so at this point of
time if it has installed the grub
bootloader to your primary dive we can
select this as yes and press continue
remember the installation was conducted
on dev SDA
so we're going to select installation of
the Guard loader on the same hard disk
that we have configured
we press this one and press continue
so now the grub bootloader is being
installed
the grub is highly essential because it
is it shows the motherboard where to
start the operating system from even if
the operating system is installed
correctly and all the files are in
correct order the absence of a
bootloader will not be able to launch
the OS properly
as you can see the installation is
finally complete so now we can press on
continue
and it's going to finalize the changes
foreign
Linux being booted up straight away it
doesn't check for the ISO file anymore
since the operating system is now
installed onto the virtual hard disk
storage that we had configured before
here we're going to enter our username
and password that we had set up before
and we have the calendar system booted
up
and this is your home page
we can see the installed applications
over here which are being used for
penetration testing by multiple security
analysts worldwide
all of these come pre-installed with car
Linux and others can be installed using
the APT package manager that we had
configured
we can see a full name over here
and with this our installation of the
Kali Linux is complete
it's no secret that the vast bulk of an
internet usage is vulnerable to hacking
whether it's so hazardous messaging apps
or faulty operating systems
penetration testing has become the norm
for vulnerability assessment in order to
fill this vacuum in digital security
Kali Linux is a well-known operating
system in this fight against hackers
Kali Linux a distribution designed
specifically for penetration testers has
layers of features that we will go over
in today's lesson and take a look at
some of the tools and features that the
operating system has to offer
let's take a look at the videos topics
and features that the operating system
has to offer
let's take a look at the videos topics
we start by learning the requirements of
an operating system like Kali Linux
we learn more about the core features of
the OS and its intricacies
moving on we take a look at the five
distinct stages of penetration testing
that dictate the flow of vulnerability
assessment in general
next we learn about some important tools
that can be found on Kali Linux which
are geared specifically for ethical
hacking purposes

let's start by learning why one should
learn Kali Linux in the first place
in today's world in organization's most
valuable asset is its information or
data this is true for all kinds of
businesses be it public or private on a
daily basis they all deal with enormous
amounts of sensitive information
as a consequence terrorist groups
hacking teams and cyber thieves often
attack them to ensure the safety and
protection businesses use a variety of
security measures and regularly update
their index
organizations must be proactive in this
age of digitalization by regularly
assessing and updating their security
everyday hackers discover new methods to
breach firewalls ethical hackers or
white hat hackers provide a fresh
perspective on security they conduct
penetration test to validate security
measures generally they will penetrate
your networks and give you relevant
information about your security posture
once an organization has this knowledge
it may upgrade its security procedures
accordingly
the latest version of Kali Linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool that was
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a great number of tools that
either simply did not work
or which duplicated other tools that
provided the same or similar
functionality
occasionally when conducting penetration
testing or hacking we must automate our
activities since there may be hundreds
of conditions and payloads to test and
manually examining everything is time
consuming
to improve our productivity we utilize
tools that come pre-packaged with Kali
Linux these tools not only save us time
but also accurately capture and process
the data
the Kylie Lennox team is made up of a
small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols restricting access of critical
code bases to external assets greatly
reduces the risk of source contamination
although penetration tools tend to be
written in English the developers have
ensured that Kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need to do for the
job
since Arm based single board systems
like the Raspberry Pi are becoming more
and more prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
Kali Linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has arm repositories
integrated with the mainline
distribution so tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution tools
now that we understand the necessity for
an operating system like Carl Linux let
us take a look at some of its core
features and offerings to the ethical
hacking world
Kali Linux formerly known as backtrack
Linux is an open source Linux
distribution which is aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing it contains several hundred
tools targeted towards various
information security tasks such as
beneficial testing security research
computer forensics and reverse
engineering
Kali Linux is a multi-platform solution
accessible and freely available to
Information Security Professionals and
hobbyists
among all the Linux distributions Kali
Linux takes its route from the Debian
operating system
Debian has been a highly dependable and
stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong Foundation
to the Kali Linux desktop
while the operating system is capable of
practically modifying every single part
of our installation the networking
components of color Linux come disabled
by default
this is done to prevent any external
factors from affecting the installation
procedure which may pose a risk in
critical environments apart from
boosting security that allows a deeper
element of security and control to the
most enthusiastic of users
foreign
let us now take a look at the five
stages or phases of penetration testing
this is the first stage of the
penetration test which is known as the
reconnaissance phase
in this stage the security researcher
collects information about the target it
can be done actively which means you are
collecting information without
contacting the Target or even both
it helps security firms gather
information about the target system
Network components active machines open
ports and access points operating system
details Etc
this activity can be performed by using
information available in the public
domain and using different tools
the next phase is more tool oriented
rather than perform manually and it is
the scanning phase
the penetration tester runs one or more
scanner tools to gather more information
about the target the penetration tester
runs one or more scanner tools to gather
information about the target
by using various scanners such as war
dialers port scanners Network mappers
and vulnerability scanners the tester
collects as many vulnerabilities which
help to turn an attack in a more
sophisticated way
the next stage is known as the gaining
access phase
in this phase the penetration tester
tries to establish a connection with the
Target and exploit the vulnerabilities
found in the previous stage
exploitation may be buffer overflow
attacks denial of service or dos attacks
session hijacking and many more
basically penetration tester extracts
information and sensitive data from
servers by gaining access using
different tools
in the maintaining access phase the
penetration tester tries to create a
backdoor for himself
it helps him to identify hidden
vulnerabilities in the system and can
later act as a gateway to retrieve
control of the system
in the Final Phase of covering tracks
the penetration tester tries to remove
all logs and Footprints which help the
administrator identify his presence this
helps the tester to think like a hacker
and perform corrective actions to
mitigate those activities
now that we understand the basics of
penetration testing and how ethical
hackers go about the way let us take a
look at some notable tools which can be
used on Kali Linux
foreign
nmap is a free and open source utility
Port scanner which can be used for
network discovery and security auditing
many systems and network administrators
also find it useful for tasks such as
Network inventory managing service
upgrade schedules and monitoring host or
service uptime
it is most beneficial in the early
stages of ethical hacking that a hacker
must figure the possible entry point to
a system before running the necessary
exploits thus allowing the hacker to
leverage any insecure openings and reach
the device
it's a part of the scanning phase of the
penetration testing
nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways
to determine what hosts are available on
the network what services this hosts are
offering what operating systems they are
running and their versions what type of
packet filters and firewalls are in use
and dozens of other characteristics
it was designed to rapidly scan large
networks but works fine against single
hosts as well
since every application that connects to
a network needs to do so via a port the
wrong port or server configuration can
open a can of worms which lead to a
thorough breach of the system and
ultimately a fully hacked device
next on the list we have Metasploit
the Metasploit framework is a very
powerful tool that can be used by cyber
criminals as well as ethical hackers to
probe systemic vulnerabilities on
networks and servers as a part of the
third stage of penetration testing it's
an open source framework which can be
easily customized and used with most
operating systems
with Metasploit the ethical hacking team
can use a ready-made or custom code and
introduce it into a network to probe for
weak spots as another flavor of threat
hunting once these flaws are identified
and documented the information can be
used to address systemic weaknesses and
prioritize Solutions
once a particular vulnerability is
identified and the exploit is fed into
the system there are a host of options
for the hacker depending on the
vulnerability hackers can even run root
commands from the terminal allowing
complete control over the activities of
the compromise system as well as all
personal data stored on the device
a big advantage of Metasploit is the
ability to run full-fledged scans on a
Target system thereby giving a detailed
picture of the security index of said
system
this also provides the necessary
exploits that can be used to bypass the
firewalls and the anti-virus software
having a single solution to gather
almost all the necessary points of
attack is very useful for ethical
hackers and penetration testers as
denoted by the high rank in this list
at number 3 we have Wireshark
Wireshark is the world's foremost and
widely used networking protocol analyzer
it lets you see what happening on your
network at a microscopic level and is
the de facto standard across many
commercial and non-profit Enterprises
government agencies and educational
institutions
Wireshark is a popular open source tool
to capture Network packets and converts
them to human readable binary format it
provides every single detail of the
organization's Network infrastructure it
consists of devices designed to help
measure the ins and outs of the network
The information collected to Wireshark
can be used for various purposes such as
real-time or offline network analysis
identification of the traffic coming
onto your network its frequency and its
latency between specific hops this helps
Network administrators generate
statistics based on real-time data
Wireshark is also a cross-platform tool
that can be installed on Windows Linux
and Mac systems to enable hackers in all
ecosystems to monitor Network traffic
irrespective of the operating system
the development team is determined to
maintain this level of freedom for their
users in the foreseeable future
the next tool on our list is air Garden
which is a part of the third phase of
penetration testing
this is a multi-use bash script for
Linux systems to hack and audit wireless
networks like our everyday Wi-Fi router
and its counterparts
along with being able to launch denial
of service attacks on compromised
networks this multipurpose wi-fi hacking
tool has very rich features which
support multiple methods for wi-fi
hacking including multiply WPS hacking
modes all in one WEP attack handshake
file capturing evil twin attacks pixie
dust and so much more
it usually needs an external network
adapter that supports monitor mode which
is necessary to be able to capture
Wireless traffic traversing the air
channels
thanks to its open source nature air
Garden can be used with multiple
Community plugins and add-ons thereby
increasing its Effectiveness against a
wide variety of routers both in the 2.4
gigahertz band and 5 gigahertz band
the next tool is John the Ripper
John the Ripper is an open source
password security auditing and password
recovery tool available for many
operating systems
John the Ripper jumbo supports hundreds
of hash and Cipher types including for
user passwords of operating systems web
apps groupware database servers Network
traffic captures encrypted private Keys
file systems and document files some of
the key features of the tool include
offering multiple modes to speed up
password tracking automatically
detecting the hashing algorithm used by
the passwords and the ease of running
and configuring the tool making it a
password tracking script of choice for
novices and professionals alike
it can use dictionary attacks along with
regular brute forcing to speed up the
process of cracking the correct password
without wasting additional resources
the word list being used in this
dictionary attacks can be used from the
user's end allowing for a completely
customizable process
now that we have covered the basics of
Kali Linux let us take a look at the
agenda for our demo today
we start out with a few terminal
commands that are a basic part of a
Linux operating system
configure our own proxy chains to
maintain anonymity while running
penetration testing attacks on our
victims
next we run a few nmap scans on a local
Windows 10 machine to find out the type
of information that can be gathered in
such a scenario
moving on we use Wireshark to monitor
internet traffic and understand the
importance of encryption and security
when browsing the World Wide Web
next we learn about Metasploit and its
various applications in the line of
vulnerability assessment of a device
and finally we use mattress product to
take root access of a fully updated
Windows 10 computer system
let's begin with some terminal Basics on
Kali Linux
when most people hear the thumb Linux
they Envision a complex operating system
used only by programmers however the
experience is not as frightening as it
appears Linux is an umbrella term for a
collection of free and open source Unix
operating systems there are many
variants like Ubuntu Fedora Debian
these are distributions which will be a
more precise term when using a Linux
operating system you will most likely
utilize a shell which is a command line
interface that provides access to the
operating system Services the majority
of Linux distributions ship with a
graphical user interface also known as
GUI as their primary shell this is done
to facilitate user interaction in the
first place having said that a command
line interface is suggested due to its
increased power and Effectiveness by
entering the commands into the CLI tasks
that require a multi-step GUI procedure
may be completed in a matter of seconds
you can start the terminal by clicking
on the prompt icon here on top
once the terminal is open
we can put up a commands the First
Command that we are going to look into
is PWD PWD stands for present working
directory
as of right now what you are seeing is
the terminal window by default if I
write PWD and press enter this shows the
directory in which the terminal is being
run on as of right now it's in the NF
folder of my desktop which is
specifically this folder if I open up
this folder you can see it is currently
empty as in it has no contents if I use
another command known as mkdir which is
supposed to stand for make directory and
I write nf2 shortage for new folder 2.
if I open up the NF you can see the new
folder is created
this is how the PWD command works
another important command
to change directories it's called the CD
command let's say right now if I am in
NF I want to create a new file in nf2
folder or something else in the nf2
folder I have to shift to CD and F2
now if I write PWD
it will show the present working
directory of Home simply learn desktop
NF and inside that I am in nf2 right now
it is done to navigate through the Linux
files and disk directories it requires
either the full path or just the name of
the directory if we have to move a
completely different folder on a
completely different file then we can
use the entire path like this
for now CD Works another few commands is
we can write CD dot dot and it will come
back one folder now the PWD will be just
NF and not nf2
let's say we are in this folder and we
want to go a different file let's say if
we just go for CD
home
simpler
that's it
right now these are the folders in our
current present working directory
we have the desktop the documents
downloads Etc
from here we can again go to the desktop
using the same CD command
cross check the changing of directories
and check the files again and yes there
we go NF how do we know this what are
the command that we are used to show the
files and folders that folder is known
as the ls command LS can be used to view
the contents of a directory by default
this command will display the contents
of your current working directory if we
add some other parameters we can find
the contents of other directories as
well
there are some hidden files as well in
Linux which cannot be showed just with
ls for example if we just go to cdetc
which is a configuration folder for
Linux if we write LS now these are the
files that can be seen
if you want to see the hidden files
we'll have to add one more parameter
here like LS minus a and as you can see
the number of files have increased this
time around
there are other things as well that we
can see with Linux
LS minus a l will show the hidden files
along with some of the parameters and
some of the permissions that has been
provided for each file
as you can see many of these files have
root access some of them can write some
of them can read
it differs file to file and the ls minus
Al command is used to check each of
these files permission and change them
accordingly if needed
the next command that we can look for is
the cat command or concatenate
it is one of the most frequently used
commands and it is used to list the
contents of a file on the output
for example let's say if I have a file
at the desktop
in this nf2 folder I will create a
document
create an empty file
e file
I'll open up the document and I'll write
it as
hello Kali
I will save this up
now to change the directories from Etc
to nf2 we have already discussed how to
use the CD command using just the folder
name now if you want to go through the
entire directory we can write Siri
home
as you can see it is already prompting
us to complete the name of the directory
at this point we just have to press tab
and it completes it for ourselves
next we already know we have to enter
the desktop
NF and nf2
and this brings us to the current
working directory here if we press LS we
can find a file over here now as
discussed for the concatenate it is used
to show the contents of a file so right
now if we press cat which stands for
concatenate
e file
as you can see we have written hello
Kali in the text file and we can see the
output right now
we can also use it to create new files
for example if we write cat
any file name such as e-file 2.
here we can write anything
hello Kali again
once you press Ctrl C here we can check
e-file 2 and we have hello Kali again
printed over here we can see the same
using the concatenate command as well if
I press LS you can see we have two files
here and I can go with cat e file to and
I have Hello Kali again this is how the
concatenate command works
apart from this it can be used to copy
there is a different command like called
CP which is used to copy the files from
one place to another mindful this is not
moving this is only going to copy the
command for example currently our PWD
which is the present fucking directory
is in the nf2 folder as you can see over
here
let's copy the E File 2 to the NF folder
we can write CP
e file to
and give the path of the NF folder which
will be home
simply learn
Tech stock
and an F
now if I press LS I'll find both the
files in nf2 since I copied
to go back to the NF folder again we can
again use the same command of
no no we can again use the home
simply learn
desktop
and just an F no nf2 this time just
enough
as you can see this will change back our
present working directory now when we
press LS we will find the e-file to file
and the nf2 folder and we can confirm
this using the GUI as well
this is the NF folder and you can see
the nf2 folder and the e-file to
document if I write cat e file to
cat e file to
we can see the contents of the file now
this can be done using moving as well
for example if I go to CD nf2 which is
the inside folder it has both the
document files like e file and E file 2.
let's say I want to move the e-file
completely from nf2 to NF1 instead of
writing CP the command I'm going to use
is MV
MV e file and again give the path of the
folder into which I have to copy which
will be again home
foreign
desktop
and NF
as you can see the contents of the nf2
have appeared here and E file has been
moved
from nf2 to
NF
this is this nf2 and we don't find e
file here anymore if we press CD dot dot
and we go back to NF LS right now and we
can file both the files e file that we
moved and E file to that we copied from
the nf2 folder so this is how copying
and moving will work using the terminal
now this is just a simple one line
statement that might take a couple of
clicks when using GUI this is why the
command line interface is considered to
be much more streamlined for Linux
operating systems
another very important command for Linux
operating system is the sudo command
Sudo is short for super user do the
command enables you to perform tasks
that require administrative or root
permissions you can think of it as how
we run programs administrator on Windows
systems it is not advisable to use this
command for daily use because it might
be easy for an error to occur and the
permissions of root are very intricate
so new beginners are advised to use the
sudo command only when absolutely
necessary for example
sudo SU
with this command I am giving this
terminal a root permission
this Su stands for this user
at this point it's going to ask for my
admin password
once I enter my password
and I now have root access note how the
password that I entered did not show up
here this is a security measure to
prevent people from snooping on your
root password which is the end game of
all this operating system
as you also can see the symbol changed
if the dollar symbol is showing its
source as a standard user when you
switch to root you can easily see a hash
symbol
this opens up a separate shell inside
this terminal command for example we can
exit out of the root user to the
standard user using the command exit and
once again we have the dollar sign and
the root has vanished over here there
are some commands that will only work
with administrative access for example
when updating the Kalil Linux system we
have to use apt update
as you can see it says problem unlinking
the file because permission denied now
let's try this using sudo
sudo APD update
as you can see it is updating the
package repositories which work as the
software installed on the system
this can be done using either writing
the sudo command every time we want to
perform a root access or we can just
write sudo Su once and write apt update
alone
the fetching is complete over here
for the second example let's say I just
write sudo Su and this time is not going
to ask me the password because at this
current terminal process I've already
provided the root password once and it
is in memory right now now when we used
to update the system we had to write
sudo apt update that was because we were
running it as a standard user now we are
running it as a root user so all we have
to write is if it update and it's going
to continue its work
there you go
another command that can be useful is
the Ping command
self-explanatory it's going to be
checking the internet connectivity you
can be used to check internet
connectivity or you can see if there is
a local server on your system which
needs to be ping then you can check that
for example if you have to write ping
and we can use either IP address or
domain let's say if you want to check
that if we can access google.com using
this Kali Linux installation or not we
can write ping google.com
and you can see it shows the bytes being
sent and received and how much time it
took to take up the request
this can be done for local systems as
well for example this installation of
Kali Linux is being run on a virtual
machine
once this machine is running I still
have my host machine running over here
the IP address of which is
192.168.29 179
if I try to Ping this from here
as you can see the time to complete the
request is drastically low compared to a
website on the internet considering this
is on the local network this is how the
pink command is worked and it can show
you what kind of packages are
transmitted how many are received if
there was any kind of packet loss
between the connection window and other
details
a very important command when working
with the terminal for long duration is a
history command
pretty self-explanatory there are so
many commands that are being run
sometimes people forget what was the
change they did oh what was the
directory name they put a history
command helps to recover some of the
commands that you have written it
doesn't go all the way back but it takes
up many commands that were inputted in
the last few processes
this is how the history command works
these are some of the most commonly used
terminal commands if you want to learn
more about this terminal and every other
feature of this please let us know in
the comment section and we will try to
make an in-depth tutorial special
effects repeat if you want to learn more
about the terminal please let us know in
the comment section and we will try to
make an in-depth tutorial specifically
for terminal commands on Linux
moving on we learn how to configure
proxy chains on a system
proxying refers to the technique of
bouncing your internet traffic through
multiple machines to hide the identity
of the original machine it is a good
tool that hackers use to accomplish this
call is proxy chains
essentially you can use proxy chains to
run any program through a proxy server
this will allow you to access internet
from behind a restrictive firewall which
hides your IP address
even allows you to use multiple proxies
At Once by chaining them together
one of the most important reasons that
proxy chains is used in a security
context is that it's easy to evade
detection attackers often use proxies to
hide their true identities while
executing an attack
and when multiple proxies are chained
together it becomes harder and harder
for forensic professional to trace the
traffic back to the original machine
when these proxies are located across
countries investigators would have to
obtain warranties in the local
jurisdictions where every proxy is
located
to see how proxygen works let's open
Firefox first and check our current IP
address
write Firefox
and there we go
as we can see Firefox is now open
let's check our current IP address right
now
if we go to an address called my
ip.com
and you can see the easily detects our
country is in India and this is a public
IP address
now
if we move to the terminal again
here we can now write
proxy chains
minus h
what is minus H does is it finds a help
it it stands for the help file this is
for help file
what we found out using this is proxy
chains has a config file here
Etc
proxychains4.conf this is the config
file found using this config file we can
customize how our proxy change should
work
if we want to open that we have to use
it in a text editor on Windows we have
notepad and other things like that
Microsoft Word to edit documents on
Linux we have a tool called Nano to
access the Nano we use the command Nano
and give the path of the file that we
want to check as of right now the proxy
chance config file is located over here
so we're going to follow the path there
chains 4 Dot comf
and here we go we see the config file
there are three basic types of proxy
chaining here
we have a strict chain where all the
proxy in the list
will be used and they will be changed in
order
we have a random chain where each
connection made through proxy genes will
be done via random combo of proxies in
the proxy list so in your Dynamic chain
it's the same as strict chain but dead
proxies are excluded from the chain
and here we can set up whichever type we
want
to enable or disable a particular type
we use the hash symbol here as you can
see right now all the lines have a
hashtag symbol at the front except this
one a dynamic chain this is the current
one being used let's say if I want to
use a strict chain method so I can add a
hash value here
and remove the hash here at one point of
time any one of these three four types
should be enabled
let's go for the Dynamic chain
we can disable this strict Chain by
putting the hashtag in front
and removing the dynamic chain
as you can see below we have few
commands to how to handle the Nano text
editor this symbol is known as the
control button on your keyboard now if
we want to write out which is synonymous
to saving the file
supposed to go with Ctrl O So if I press
Ctrl o on my keyboard it says file name
to write and we have to press enter here
since we want to overwrite the proxy
chains 4.0 NF file we don't want to
create a new file over here so just
press enter
and we get a permission denied this
permission denied we're getting is
because we have opened this using a
standard user Etc is a system folder to
be able to use make some changes we have
to use it using a sudo command to exit
this Nano we have to use the control X
command we use Ctrl X
we're going to clear
and this time we're going to use the
sudo command
sudo Nano
Etc
proxy chains
4.0
and we have the same file open up again
now this time if you want to make a
change let's say we're going to add a
strict chain instead of dynamic chain
which remove the hashtag from strict
we're going to use Ctrl o for the save
file option we're going to press enter
and it says root 160 lines
again if you want to reverse this change
we put the hashtag over here
enable Dynamic chain
we press Ctrl o
press enter and it says root 160 lines
now we can exit straight away using the
control X format
right now we have not provided any file
or a proxy chain we can have proxy IP
addresses from the internet but we have
to make sure that they are safe and they
don't Snoop on our data
when there is no proxy change being
provided personally it going it's going
to use the Tor Network but for that we
have to start door
is a service in Linux to know more about
the store we can write sudo systemctl
which is used to know the status of
services on the Linux operating system
and status of torque
a system CTL sorry as instead of STL it
should be system CTL status torque as
you can see it is a toss service
anonymizing overlay Network for TCP
connections and it's currently inactive
now to start this up we have to write
sudo systemctl start
Dot now if we repeat the same sudo
system CTL status Star as you can see
it's active now
you can see the green logo over here
okay
to integrate the Firefox and the browser
we can use the proxy chains command
directly over here we can write proxy
chains we can use Firefox to launch our
web browser and let's say if we want to
visit google.com
we press enter
and the Firefox window is launched
and it should open up google.com next
and there we go
if we go to my ip.com once again
as you can see we have a different IP
address and the country is a known as
well
so this is how we can use proxy chains
to anonymize a internet usage when using
Kali Linux
next on our agenda is the ability to
scan networks using nmap
at its core nmap is a network scanning
tool that uses IP packets to identify
all the devices connected to a network
can learn more about nmap using the help
file
as you can see these are some of the
parameters that can be used when
scanning ports of a system you can see
the version and the URL of the webs of
the service
over here the primary users of nmap can
be broken into three group processors
first the program gives you detailed
information on every IP active on your
network and then each IPA can then be
scanned
secondly it can also be used to
providing a lot of live hosts and open
ports as well as identifying the OS of
every connected device
thirdly
and map has also become a valuable tool
for users looking to protect personal
and business websites
using nmap to scan your own web server
particularly if you are hosting your
website from home is essentially
simulating the process that a hacker
would use to attack your site attacking
your own site in this way is a powerful
way of identifying security
vulnerabilities
as we already discussed The Host Windows
10 machine on the system has an IP
address a 192 168 29.179
if you want to test the OS scan of the
system we're going to first get the root
permission over here
we use the sudo command and now we are a
root user we're going to launch the
command and map
minus o which is supposed to be an OS
detection scan the IP address we can use
of the host system
192.168.29.179
in a legitimate penetration testing
scenario we can use the IP address of
the vulnerable disk device over here
we are going to let it scan for a while
and it's going to give us some guesses
on what can the OS be
as you can see the scan is done and it
has shown some of the ports that are
open
you can see the msrpc port open at the
https 443 Port open which is used to
connect to the internet and it has some
aggressive OS guesses as well for
example it thinks there's a 90 94 chance
that it's going to be a Microsoft
Windows XP Service Pack 3. that's partly
because a lot of the Windows XP update
packages are still prevalent on Windows
now that the OS detection is confirmed
there are multiple more details that we
can gather from nmap
let's go with the NF minus a command
which is supposed to capture as much
data as possible
there is also a speed setting you can
call it a speed setting or a control
setting of the minus t
minus t ranges from t 0 to T1 to T
through all the way up to D5
this basically determines how
aggressively the victim is being scanned
if you scan slowly it will take more
time to provide the results but it will
also give a less chance for the
intrusion detection system on the
vulnerable machine firewall to detect
that someone is trying to penetrate the
network for now if we want to go with
somewhat of a high speed we can go with
the T4 and provide the same IP address
of the local machine I am trying to
attack
it's going to take a little bit of time
since it's trying to capture a lot of
information
as you can see the results are now
here
it launched a scan and took a few top
ports that are most likely vulnerable
from a Windows XP perspective and it
showed
a few ports over here it has not shown
991 filtered ports which could not be
attacked anyway since they were closed
for outside access it shows a few
fingerprint settings like the connection
policies and the port details
it shows an HTTP options some other
intricate details that can be used when
you attacking its servers
it shows a VMware version that it's
running
and some few other ports over here
apart from that we also have the
aggressive OS gases over here just like
we did with the minus o and you can see
this time it is showing Windows 7 as 98
percent
no exactos matches since uh if there was
any exact wise matches we could have
seen a hundred percent chances over here
this is a trace route a trace route will
be the time and the path a connection
request takes from the source to the
destination for example this request
went from 192
168.72.2 to a destination address since
this is a local machine it took only a
single step and multiple occasions so if
you're trying to access a remote system
it's going to be a number of free suits
when it jumps from firewall to firewall
and router to router
this is how we can use nmap to find
information about a system and find some
vulnerable ports we can access
moving on we have a tutorial on how to
use Wireshark to sniff Network traffic
to start using Wireshark we're going to
have to open the application first now
during installation of Wireshark there
is an option to enable if non-root users
can be able to capture traffic or not
in my installation I have disabled that
so I will be launching Wireshark when
using the root user itself
also to capture data we need an external
Wi-Fi adapter
you can see it over here in the VM tab
removable devices
re link 802.1 and WLAN
this is a external Wi-Fi adapter which
is inserted into my USB system
you can see it over here if I write
iwconfig
this is the one wlan0 this is absolutely
necessary because we need to have a
monitor mode required but it won't need
it for sniffing data on Wireshark right
now but it's going to be necessary later
on in this tutorial as well as we will
see for now we can just start up
Wireshark by writing its name on the
command line and it should start the
program
here we go
here it's going to check which of the
adapters we want to use for example
right now the eth0 which supposed to
stand for ethernet 0 Port you can see
data is being transmitted up and down
we're going to select 88 0
and we have started capturing data you
can see this data requests from the
source so destination and the time and
the which protocol it is following
everything we can see and we can see the
ipv4 flags here as well
as you can see over here
to capture internet traffic
we can try running Firefox
if we just write Wikipedia
.com
and you can see the number of requests
increasing
okay this is spelling mistake Wikipedia
yeah
you can see the application data of all
these requests going up
and they're connected to a destination
server of 1 0 through 102.166.224
now if you even if you check the
transmission control protocol Flags over
here and so many more things we cannot
find anything beneficial as you can see
the information over here is gibberish
which is supposed to be since it's
supposed to be encrypted
now
this is possible due to this being an
https website hence you can see the lock
symbol over here and connection is
supposed to be secure
now what about HTTP ports we have seen
many people recommend to not visit HTTP
ports
repeat
we have seen many people recommend to
not visit HTTP websites and even if we
have to visit to not provide any
critical information
for example let's go to a random
HTTP page over here
as you can see this is
saying connection is not secure and this
is an HTTP HTTP page and not https
now let's check for some of the
information that is passing through this
this is a login form let's say I have a
legitimate account over here
if I write my account name
and my password is supposed to be
password one two three four
I press login
and the password does not match because
I do not have an account over here but
let's say I did and I was logged in as
expected you can go to Wireshark we can
use filters over here now all the
requests that I am sending it's a TCP
request so I can write a filter
containing TCP
contains
whatever string if it is being passed
let's say for the end user name I write
my account name
so I can just write my account name over
here
and press enter
to find a request over here now as you
can see
there are many flags over here
if we go to the HTT HTML form URL
encoded and open up some of its Flags
as you can see I can see my account name
and simply learn password over here this
is the same
details that I input on the website
let's say I did have a legitimate
account on this website I would have
logged in with no problems but anyone
who would be using Wireshark to sniff on
the data can easily get my credentials
from here
this is why it's recommended to not
provide any information on HTTP Pages
the security is not up to the mark and
always look for the lock symbol when
visiting any website or making any
internet transactions or providing any
information
this is how we can use Wireshark to
detect transmission and sniff packet
data that is being transferred to the
network adapter
next we have to learn about what is
metasploy
the Metasploit project is a computer
security project that provides
information about security
vulnerabilities and AIDS in penetration
testing and IDs development
we can open up the terminal here we're
going to allow root access
and to open up Metasploit the keyword is
msf console
that's going to take a little bit of
time to start it up
now the Metasploit console has been
loaded
from here we can decide what type of
attack we want to launch and what kind
of exploits we can launch against
vulnerable targets for example like we
already discussed I am running this
virtual machine on a Windows 10 host
machine so if I open the command prompt
from my Windows 10 over here
if I need to check the IP address once I
go with ipconfig
here you can see the IP address of this
local machine
moving on
if we have to attack that machine let's
say we want to see what kind of exploits
is going to work over there
now we already know that Windows has
some common vulnerabilities one of those
vulnerabilities is the HTA server
vulnerability HDA is supposed to be a
HTML application but when past the right
payload it can be used to open a back
door into a system
to start off with the Metasploit and
accessing such applications
we're going to use the command use
exploit and the name of the reverse HTA
server is this windows
for miscellaneous
HTA server
as you can see it already found this one
all right now there are some options
that we need to set for this exploit to
go through for example you can see some
of the options over here there is a
payload the payload is supposed to be
the malicious file that we are going to
send on the HTML application which
allows us to give the back door
for example right now the payload which
is the malicious file is a Windows meter
printer reverse TCP
completely understandable now let's set
the L host
L host and R host and SRV host should be
the one where we are going to launch the
attack from for example if we launched
another tab of this console
and we just press i f config
the IP address is 192 plus 168 72130
so we're going to set the L host as
192.168.72.130
and we're going to do the same thing
with SRV host
we're going to set up port
where we need to capture the back door
axis
next
the payload has already been set this
payload will launch a back door and give
us meter prita access to the system
metaprita is can be considered as an
upgrade of a normal command prompt shell
we will look into it once we get the
access in the first place
now that we have set the commands we can
press on exploit and press enter
now you can see we have a URL over here
we're going to copy this URL
once the URL is copied we take it into
the browser
and paste it
this will ask us to download this file
now as per browser security settings
this file should be blocked by default
we can decide to keep it and with the
correct formulation of this malicious
package even the website browser
antivirus softwares will not be able to
detect good payloads you're going to
save this file
and we're going to open it
publisher could not be verified if we
press run and we go back to our meter
beta access over here
you can see it has already captured the
URL of an HD server and it is writing
delivering payload
just have to wait for a few seconds so
the payload is delivered
it has sent this much amount of data
meter Peter session one is opened
and we should get the access soon
there we go now to understand where is
the session set
we can write sessions minus I
as you can see it has a meter beta over
here we're going to write sessions minus
I
the session ID is one so we're going to
write one and we have the meter beta
access now to get a fair idea of the
system
we're going to write this info and it's
going to the computer name the OS
architecture all these things we can
write the help command to see what are
the things that we can get out of the
system we can take screenshots we can
control the webcam and start a video
chat
we can take a lot of things over here
there are other commands as well where
we can change the file directory like
the cad command CD command there are so
many things that work in the normal CMD
which we can run on the meter beta as
well now if you want to access this
command prompt of the system directly we
can go with this we have to write shell
and there we go we are in the downloads
folder right now to see if this is the
same computer or not we're going to
write ipconfig
as you can see it is our victim machine
with 192.168 but 29.171 we can just
press exit and we're back with the meter
beta access
this is how we can use metaprita and
Metasploit to gain access to a Windows
10 machine next let's take a look at how
we can get to root access from a Windows
10 system
we just learned how we can get a meter
beta access from a system
we can background this meter Builder
session by writing background and
pressing enter
we can still we can still see the shares
sessions minus I it's still present over
here
now
these kind of access are not
administrative access
these are the kind of back Toes that can
be created for standard users but to get
a complete access of a system including
the program files the windows documents
we need to have root access or
administrative access
through that we're going to use another
exploit
reminder that the meter Peter session of
the standard access is already present
and we're not messing with it right now
we're going to set up another session
albeit with the same machine
that exploit name is
use exploit windows
local
bypass USC
Event Viewer
and there we go now if we check the
options that we can put in the system
we have to choose an exploit Target
we need to put a session as well
let's say we going to use the session
one this is the session that has the
meter beta access with the standard user
it doesn't have the system user
we're going to write
set Session 1
and we're going to run export run a few
commands and it opened a second meter
beta session
as you can see it is the session 2.
if I write this info
you can still see I am not the
system user right now I'm still just a
normal user how can we check that
if you go to Shell
considered CC users can be downloads all
these things
if I press exit
go back to the meter bitter there is a
command on meter beta get system it
attempts to elevate your privilege to
that of the local system which basically
means you get promoted into root access
so if we write get system
and due to pipe impersonation we now
have the system root access
as you can see now it has become x64 and
we are the admin users now if I go to
Shell
I can easily go back
windows
and I can easily access these things
this kind of control over the windows
folders and the program files folders
these kind of things are not possible if
you are not an admin access or the
command prompt has not been run with
admin permissions this is how we can use
privilege escalation to get into an
admin access system
we use the second exploit which was the
bypass us Event Viewer exploit
and essentially used to do the first
session as you can read here Windows
escalation USC protection bypass
it was first disclosed on 2016 but it
still works on some systems
this is how we can get a root access on
a Windows 10 installation

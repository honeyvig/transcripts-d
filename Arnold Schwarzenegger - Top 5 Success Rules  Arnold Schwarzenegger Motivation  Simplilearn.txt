now let me get right away to the first
rule of success the first rule of
success is to have a vision
you see if you don't have a vision of
where you go and if you don't have a
goal where you go
you drift around and you never end up
anywhere
it's like you can have the best ship in
the world you can have the best airplane
in the world if the pilot or the captain
doesn't know where to go it would just
drift around it would not end up
anywhere or most likely in the wrong
place
i couldn't see myself becoming a farmer
or worker in a factory
or anything like that
even though my parents wanted me to stay
there and have a normal life
my father wanted me to become a police
officer like he was
but that was their vision not mine
my vision was totally different i felt
that i was born for something special
for something unique for something big
this is the blueprint for my life
this is exactly what i want to do
i want to become a bodybuilding champion
just like rich park
i want to get into movies just like rich
park
and i want to make millions of dollars
and be rich and famous
just like reg park
so let me tell you something visualizing
your goal and going after it makes it
fun you got to have a purpose no matter
what you do in life you got to have a
purpose
[Music]
now my second
my second rule is never ever think small
if you're going to accomplish anything
you have to think big you have to go and
shoot for the stars
the biggest challenge most people have
is because they think small and the
reason why people think small and why
they choose small little goals is
because they're afraid to fail they know
that if you shoot for a big goal then
the chances of failing are very high
and they're afraid of failing
and you know something
that the only time you really consider
the failure is if you fall and you don't
get up
but if you get up you never consider the
failure so i never considered myself a
failure i always considered myself a
winner even though i fell every so often
but i always got up and i always move
forward so remember
never think small
think big
[Music]
and the next thing the third point that
i'm gonna make to you is don't listen to
the naysayers
don't listen to the naysayers
[Applause]
everything i ever did
the thing that they heard out of
people's mouth was that's impossible
that can't be done
you can't be a bodybuilding champion
that is exactly what i heard and of
course i proved to the people that it
can't be done
[Music]
so whenever someone said to me
it can't be done i heard it can be done
when they said no i heard yes
and when they said it's impossible i
heard it is possible
if i would have listened to the
naysayers from bodybuilding to show
business to the
to politics
i would not be standing here today
talking to you
i will be in austria in the alps
yodeling
that's right
i will be in austria still left yodling
that's what i will be doing exactly
so this is why i say don't listen to the
naysayers
[Music]
my fourth rule is
work your ass off
nobody ever stumbled upon success by
accident i always believed no stone
unturned
work your butt off that's what i always
believe no matter what you do work work
work
it doesn't matter in what area you're in
no pain no gain
the bottom line is one of my rules
which is work your butt off if you don't
apply that rule all the other rules
won't mean anything i believe of what
ted turner said who is one of the great
entrepreneurs who started cnn and so on
he said early to bed early to rise
work like hell and advertise so that's
what i believe
just remember you can climb that ladder
of success
with your hands in your pockets
you must work your ass off it's that
simple
[Music]
my fifth and last rule is
don't just take
give something back
leave your mark on the world i believe
that we all have an obligation to do
something for our community
something for our state something for
our country
we must serve a cause that is greater
than ourselves
because we all know that on the end we
will be judged not by how much we made
but how much we give
every single time i reached out and i
gave something back i felt fantastic
nothing made me happier
i would rather play chess with an
eight-year-old kid in an after-school
program
or play golf a round of golf with a
special olympian then go down another
red carpet of a movie premiere and have
nothing against movies but to give
something back to me is more important
than just to think about myself
so i feel very strongly all of us need
to have and
embrace that kind of a spirit
we all can create change whether it is
in our neighborhood or in our local
schools or in our country it can be big
but it can also be as little as just
going to a school kid that has problems
reading and teaching that kids how to
read or how to do math we don't have to
just work on me
we should also work on we
not just me but also we remember that to
lead a truly full life you must give
back you must leave the world a better
place than you found it
[Music]

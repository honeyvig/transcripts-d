hey everyone this is harsh bhardwaj
welcome back to another video by simply
learn
in this session we are going to learn
about c
gui that is graphical user interface and
how to configure visual studio and make
a gui application
so without further ado let's get started
to develop c plus gui or c plus plus
graphical user interface apps we must
have an ide
that supports c plus gui applications
and visual studio is one of the best ide
for that
here ide stands for integrated
development environment
there are many versions of visual studio
for gui apps
but i suggest you to download visual
studio 2019
there are three editions of visual
studio 2019 that is community
professional and enterprise
we can download the community edition
once the visual studio is downloaded and
installed then you need to launch this
application
after that you can select the color
theme
and change the development settings to
visual c plus
then the visual studio will look like
this
then here we will click on this create a
new project
and now we have to search for a project
template named clr
emptyproject.net framework
so we'll type
clr
emptyproject.net framework
here it is
make sure that there is dotnet framework
over here
now all we have to do is to click on
this
and
select next
now here
we can name our project let's say i have
named it project2 and we can select the
location
and now we can click on this create
button
now our project is being created
so here it is
so now let's create a form file by going
to the project
then add item
add new item
now here visual c plus plus
under visual c plus plus we'll click on
ui and then windows form
we'll click on this windows form and
click on this add button
so our file is loading
so it will show you this error but you
don't need to worry about this one you
can simply close it
now we will go to project
then into properties
then now we'll click on this linker
open this linker
now we'll go to the system
then inside this subsystem
over here
we'll select
windows
here it is
now after doing this then we go to
advanced
and in advance we can change this entry
point to main
we'll write main main
this main is the starting function
now we can
press ok over here
now you need to open this myform.cpb
here it is and you have to copy this
code
and just paste it over here
we will add this code in the description
you can take this code from there and
add it
now make sure to write your project name
over here
like my project name is project2
so i'll write
project
two
yes
so after doing this we can save it by
pressing ctrl n s
and now we can go to my form dot h
here we can see there is no form so we
need to
save it and close this
visual studio once
now we need to open the visual studio
again
we'll go over here we'll write visual
studio 2019 here it is we'll click on
this
and this is launching
we can click on this project too
now
let's go to
myform.h
we'll click on this
it is getting loaded
here we can see the form
earlier we are only able to see the code
but now we can see this form
now we can check this by running it by
clicking on this local windows debugger
button we'll click on that
and let's see if it is running or not
it will take some time
so here it is it is running properly as
you can see this is my form
and
this is ready to use so it is the
debugging is going on so if we have to
close the debugging or stop the
debugging we can click on this cross
button
so the debugging is closed now and we
have verified that the form is running
correctly we can also add some buttons
and labels to this form like this we can
click on this toolbox
then we can select this button
and we can click this over here
so this is our button and we can select
some more labels
all right we can click on this toolbox
again
and select another button
like this over here
and
now
we can select a label let's say
and click over here
and we can also adjust the size of these
buttons
like this
and like this we can adjust the size
and this is the label
we have to adjust his size by setting
its format we can
do it by
clicking on this label
and going to properties
over here we can see as we have clicked
on the label
so we can see the text that is label one
here we can see text
label one
so it is this text which is written we
can change this one
by clicking on this we can select
hello there we can write like this and
it will be shown over this side
now
we must click
the label first then only we can access
the
button or label
so now let's say this is the font so we
can click on this font
and adjust this
here it is let's say
i have adjusted it to 18 size and
made it bold now we can click this okay
on this side so here we can see hello
there it is bold now
similarly we can do this for button as
well
as we have clicked on this button as you
can see
now i can go to this properties
now
inside this properties there is text
that is button one we can see we can
change this like we can write click here
and
we can also adjust its font
here it is
let's say 12
and bold oblique
click on this okay and here it is
click here
we can adjust it over there and suppose
if you want to delete some
button or label or something like that
so we can click on this
and
right click on this side and here we can
see delete we'll click on this late and
it will be deleted
there are more options in tool box like
there is text box
list box list view
picture box
check box etc we can select as per our
choice
and we can adjust its layout or editing
by going to the properties column
so now let's make a calculator program
so for that we have to create a
calculator layout so let's just delete
all these
delete this one
and we'll delete this one as well
now we'll go to the toolbox
and select a text box we can search it
over here
text box
here it is we can click on that
and put it over here
here it is
we have to adjust its formatting
so we'll go to properties and
we'll go to font
and click on this font
now let's say adjust it to
22
and
make it bold
bold oblique yes
i will click on this okay
and
we have to create another one so
instead of doing this all we can copy
this one and to copy this we can go to
this side and click right click over
here
and we can click on this copy
and then we can paste it
here it is because we have to enter two
numbers and for that we need to have two
text boxes for a calculator
all right now in between we can mention
the
operation or operator whatsoever for
that we can we have to select the label
and we go to toolbox
and
here it is
text box
but we have to select
label
all right
label
we'll click on this label and
put it over here
now we have to adjust it
now here we will write
let's say its font would be
20
and
it would be bold oblique
it will look nice then click on ok
now we have to adjust what is written
inside it so we can go to text and click
on this
label one now
we can write operator
but it would be so long so we can write
op
that means operator
all right
it gives the idea
about the operator
we have to adjust it a bit
all right here it is
and
okay now we have to create a buttons for
addition subtraction multiplication so
we'll go to toolbox
and now we'll
search for buttons
we'll click on button and put it over
here
and now we'll adjust it by going to
properties
and going to fonts
let's adjust it to
22
and make it bold
now we'll click on ok
and now we have to change the label of
it
first of all let's select
its layout like this
it would be
big
now we'll go to properties
and
we'll go to text
and we'll make an edition sign over here
and now we'll click on this so here we
can see so now we'll copy this button to
create the
next three buttons so
click on this copy and paste it
we'll do this for the other two as well
and we'll change the text by going to
properties later onwards
here it is
so first will be addition then here
let's make it
subtraction we're going to
properties we'll click on this
properties
now
let's make this text as
minus
all right now we can also change
the color of this text
let's say
we can make this
this here it is
blue in color now we'll change this one
we'll go to properties
and
make this as
sign of multiplication but we'll press
x
so that will look nice
all right now this one
we'll go to properties and change this
to
division sign
and we can change this one as well
it will look nice
let's make it this similar color to the
subtraction
all right here it is here are four
buttons addition subtraction
multiplication and division
now we have to display the result as
well so
we'll go to toolbox and we'll search for
label
we'll click on this label
and put it over here
all
right let's make it like this and
let's put it
over this side it will look nice over
here
properties now we have to adjust it
let's make it 22
bold oblique
okay
here is our result and let's name it as
result as well we'll go to text here it
is labeled to written
we'll write
result
now whatsoever operation is done its
result or output is displayed over this
side
now all we need to do is to add the
functionality to these buttons
so let's do that we'll click on this
two times
on this button and the button name
actual name of that button is button one
so here it is
so this part is for button one and we
know that button one is addition so we
need to do addition over here
so let's start
first of all we'll
[Music]
we'll have to declare a variable
int result or output or
unser whatsoever we want
let's write output
now to add those we need the names of
those two text boxes
so we'll go to format design
and we need these names both of these
text box names so we'll click on this
first
and we'll go to properties so here it is
text box one we can see
and we click on this
and properties this is text box two
and this is similarly this is button one
button two button three button four
we can check this by going to properties
and by clicking them and going to
properties so this is text box one and
this is text box too
so now we know the names
now all we have to do
is to write
text box
text box where b is capital
we have to write the exact name we can
check it over here that this is text box
we can check the spelling
this is text box two this is label one
this is button one this is button two we
can
check the spellings from there now
now we have to use the
arrow operator
we'll write like this this is the air
operator this will give us the access to
the members of the object
all right so
we have to change the text so we'll
write
text
with t capital
alright
now we have to add
the text box too
and we'll do it same
we'll write
this ad operator
and text
now this addition which we have written
over here is wrong
because we are actually adding the
strings
as you can see
when we type any number over here it is
a string and same goes for this part
so we have to convert it
first we will convert both of these
text to integer and then we will
again convert the result into string
because we have to display it over here
and for that we need a string so then
again we have to convert it to the
string
and let's do it
so what we gonna do is we will write
system
and then the scope resolution operator
convert
again scope resolution inverter
operator sorry 2
and
16
i must be capital keep in mind to int
16.
all right now here we'll write
text
box with b capital
and then this add operator
and we'll write text
all right
after that sign of addition
again we'll do the same
system scope resolution operator
convert scope resolution operator
to
end
16
and
text box 2 here we have to write text
box 2
arrow operator
text
all right
here is the addition part now we have to
display the result
now to do that
first check the name of the result like
this is the result we'll click on this
and go to properties
its name is label 2
so we have to make the changes into
label two we'll go to this
format
now we'll
have to change the text that is we have
to change the result that is written
into the
output
so for that we will write
label
2 which is the name
then this arrow operator
after that we'll write text because we
have to change it
and then
we'll write
system
scope resolution operator
convert
scope resolution operator
to
string because we have to display the
output into string
as i have already told you
all right
now
over here we have to write
output
this output
okay
so let's check if it is working or not
we'll go to local windows debugger and
click on this
hope it works
here it is
my form
so let's try to add
let's say 5
plus
9
and we'll click on this add button
14 and we know that 5 plus 9 equal to 14
so
it is working fine we can see and now we
have to do this for all the buttons that
is subtraction multiplication and
division so let's go ahead and do that
let's first close this debugging
we have stopped the debugging and we'll
go to this
now we have to do that for
the next three buttons so we'll
all right
now we'll click on this
subtraction button two times
here we can see
now
the code is same for all of these
and
so we can copy the code from here
and we have just copied it and we'll
paste it
and we'll make the
changes in the sign like i have used
here
minus sign for the subtraction
and the rest is good yeah
all right now we'll do it for the next
one that is
multiplication
and double click on that
and here it is
we'll copy the code from here
and paste it
we'll change the sign
the subtraction not the multiplication
sign this is this multiplication sign
and now
the next one that is division
here we go
we'll again
select copy
and paste
let's change the sign of this as well
okay
as we have done the changes so let's
save it by pressing ctrl n s
and
it is saved now let's try to run this
hope it works we'll click on this local
windows debugger
it usually takes some time and here it
is
so let's try now
five
plus
six let's do this first of all edition
11
now
we'll do
20 minus
6 so we'll click on this minus
and 20 minus 6 equals to 14 that's right
and now we'll do 20 into
3 that is 60
click on this multiply sign 20 into 3
that is 60 it is right
now let's say
15
and three yeah
we click on divide and this is five
so all of our
buttons is working fine so this is how
we can create a calculator
in visual studio 2019
you can also create this calculator
program in your pc all you need to do is
to download visual studio 2019 and
install it and you can follow the steps
and you can create this calculator
application
and with that we have come to the end of

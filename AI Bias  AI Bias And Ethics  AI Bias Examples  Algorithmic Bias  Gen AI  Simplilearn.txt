hello everyone I am M and welcome to
simpl YouTube channel artificial
intelligence or AI is Transforming Our
World making things faster and more
efficient but what happens when AI makes
mistakes when AI is biased it can have
serious consequences for companies and
people's lives imagine missing out on a
job being wrongly identified in a photo
or being unfairly treated all because a
computer program made a bad decision
these mistakes don't just harm
individuals they can affect entire
communities without realizing it so AI
bias is also called algorithmic bias
happens when AI system unintentionally
favor one group over another take
healthcare for example if the data used
to train an AI system doesn't include
enough women or people from minority
groups the system might not work as well
for them this can lead to incorrect
medical prediction like giving black
patients less accurate result than white
patients in job hiring AI can
unintentionally promote certain
stereotypes like when job ads use STM
like ninja which may attract more men
than women even though the term isn't a
requirement for the job even in Creative
areas like image generation AI can
reinforce biases when asked to create
picture of CEOs AI system often show
Mostly white men leaving out women and
people of color in law enforcement AI
tools sometimes rely on biased data
which can unfairly Target minority
communities so in this video we will
explore some well-known examples of AI
bias and how these mistakes are
impacting people and Society from
Healthcare to hiring and even criminal
justice AI bias is something we need to
understand and fix so let's dive in and
learn how these bias happen and what can
be done to stop them craving a career

below dive into the link in the
description to Fast Track your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start here is a quick
info for you dive into the future of AI
with our generative Ai and machine
learning course in collaboration with en
ICT Academy I garti learn tools like
chat GPT open AI hugging face Python and
more join Master Class LED by iatg
faculty engage in handson project and
earn executive alumni status so find the
course link from the description box
below and the pin comand so without any
further Ado let's get started so what is
AI bias AI bias also called machine
learning bias happens when human biases
affect the data used to train AI system
causing unfair or inaccurate results
when AI bias isn't fixed it can hurt a
business success and prevent some people
from fully participating in the economy
or Society biases makes AI less accurate
which reduce its Effectiveness
businesses May struggle to benefit from
systems that give unfair result and
Scandals from AI bias can lead to loss
of trust especially among groups like
people of color woman people with
disabilities and the lgbtq community AI
models often learn from the data that
reflect Society biases this can lead to
unfair treatment of marginalized groups
in the areas like hiring policing and
credit scoring as a Wall Street Journal
notes businesses still find it
challenging to address this widespread
biases as the AI use grows so mov
forward let's see some sources of AI
bias distorted outcomes can negatively
affect both organization and society as
a whole so here are some common forms of
AI bias the first one is algorithm bias
if the problem or question is not well
defined or the well feedback provided to
the machine learning algorithm is
inadequate the result may be inaccurate
or misleading the second one is
cognitive bias since AI system rely on a
human input they can be affected by
unconscious human biases which may
influence either the data set or the
model's Behavior the third one
confirmation bias this occurs when the
AI overly depends on existing beliefs or
Trends in the data reinforcing prior
biases and falling to detect new
patterns or Trends the fourth one
execution bias when important data is
omited from the data set often due to
the developer overlooking New or crucial
factors this type of bias arises the
fifth one measurement biases so this
bias stems from incomplete data such as
when a data set fails to represent the
entire population for instance if a
college analyze only graduates to
determine success factors it would
Overlook reasons why other drop out so
moving forward let's see how to avoid
bias so here are checklist of six
process steps that can keep AI programs
free of bias the first one is choose the
right model ensure diverse stakeholder
select training data in supervised model
and integrate bias Direction tools in
unsupervised models the second one use
accurate data train AI with complete
balanced data that reflects the true
demographics the third one build a
diverse team a Vari team helps sport
buyers including innovators creators
implementers and end users the next one
watch data processing buyers can appear
during any phase of processing so stay
vigilant throughout the fifth one
monitor regularly so continuously test
models and have independent assessment
to detect and fix biases and the last
one check infr structure ensure
technological tools and sensors are
functioning properly to avoid hidden
biases so conclusion is AI biases
process serious challenges by amplifying
existing societal biases affecting
individuals and businesses from
Healthcare to hiring AI system can
unintentionally reinforce stereotypes
and inequalities so with this we have

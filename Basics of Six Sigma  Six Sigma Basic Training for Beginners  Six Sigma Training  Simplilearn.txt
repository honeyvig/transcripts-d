Link in the description box listen to
our happy Learners what they say about
our course
even after working for 18 years I
believe you are never too old to learn
new skills and acquire knowledge to
excel further and keep up the growth
that's why I decided to upskill myself
to hone my skills to improve my
performance in my current organization
the course not only helped me to acquire
skills and get certified but also gave
me a decent salary hike hey I am Aditya
Canaria I live in Pune with my family
I am currently working as a quality
manager at the source system Global
Services I recently got certified in the
postgraduate program in lean Six Sigma
in collaboration with UMass armrest from
Simply learn I am a curious learner and
continuous Improvement is my motto this
isn't the first time I choose simply
learned to upskill myself
I even took the project management
course earlier which motivated me to go
for another one I am working in the
quality management domain for 18 years
now when I was assigned position of
quality manager I decided to take up the
course in Lindsay Sigma
I wanted to make sure that I am fully
updated with all the recent case studies
to master myself in the field of quality
management the course boosted my
knowledge is studies from Harvard
Business publishing and Capstone project
from kpms in India they provide real
world lead and Six Sigma exposure one of
the best attraction of Singaporean
course is a well-structured course
content that consists of all the
industry 11 modules and projects
the concepts were easier to learn thanks
to the pedagogy of the faculty
everything they taught was practical and
experience driven even the support team
made the learning smoother because of
their instant response and great problem
solving the certification has already
made me stand out from the crowd and has
brought me closer to my goal of
excelling in the field of quality
management in my leisure time I spent my
time cooking delicious food and trying
my hands at new recipes I also love
photography and enjoy clicking pictures
with my DSL learning keeps me thriving
for Perfection it keeps me growing
professionally because growth is the
only constant that leads to success so
without any further Ado let's begin over
to our experts imagine you've been
tasked with a really important project
at work the company you're working for
produces luxury cars the production
numbers are going down and a lesser
number of cars are getting manufactured
each day there also seems to be an issue
with the quality of the windshield
wipers that go on these cars the
question you are faced with is there a
way for the company to stop the stall in
production and increase the production
per day day from one thousand to two
thousand also is there a way to find out
what's causing the drop in the wiper
quality there is Six Sigma Six Sigma
gives you the tools and techniques to
determine what's making the
manufacturing process slow down how you
can eliminate the delays improve the
process and fix further issues along the
way the concept was introduced in 1980
by Bill Smith while working for Motorola
since then Six Sigma has seen worldwide
adoption Six Sigma aims to reduce the
time defects and variability experienced
by processes in an organization thanks
to Six Sigma you can produce a
defect-free product
99.996 of the time allowing only 3.4
errors per 1 million opportunities 6
Sigma also increases Customer Loyalty
towards the brand improves employee
morale leading to higher productivity
Six Sigma has two major methodologies
dmaic and dmadv let's look at the first
methodology
dmaic is an acronym for Define measure
analyze improve and control let's have a
look at each of these stages
individually and how it relates to your
earlier problem in the Define phase you
determine what issues you're facing what
your opportunities for improvement are
and what the customer requires of you
here you look at the process as a whole
and determine the issues with the
manufacturing process in this case
finding out why the cars had varying
windshield wiper quality and how to
optimize the current process to
manufacture more cars in the measure
phase you determine how the process is
performing currently in its unaltered
state you determine the current number
of cars that are manufactured in a day
in the current scenario 1000 cars are
manufactured in a day and each of these
cars are outfitted with a pair of
windshield wipers by one of 30 machines
used some of the metrics measured or how
many cars are produced in a day time
taken to assemble a car how many
windshield wipers were attached in a day
time that takes them to do so defects
detected from each machine on assembly
completion and so on following this in
the analyze phase you determine what
caused the defect or variation on
analyzing previous data you find out
that one of the machines that installed
the windshield wiper was not performing
as well as it was supposed to production
was taking longer since the car chassis
was being moved across the different
locations slower as cranes had to
individually pick and drop the frame
this was because the wheels were
attached to the car only in the last
stage next in the improved days you make
changes to the manufacturing process and
ensure the defects are addressed
replace the faulty machines that
installed the windshield wiper with
another one you also find a way to save
time by attaching Wheels on the frame in
the initial stages of the manufacturing
process unlike how it was done earlier
now the car can be moved across the
assembly area faster and finally in the
control phase you make regular
adjustments to control new processes and
future Performance Based on the changes
made the company was able to reduce
production time and manufacture about 2
000 cars a day with a higher quality of
output dmaic is one of the most commonly
used methodologies in the world it
focuses on improving the existing
products of the organization the second
methodology is dmadv which is short for
Define measure analyze design and verify
it is used when the company has to
create a new product or service from
scratch it is also called dfss or design
for Six Sigma
let's take the scenario where the
company decides to build a new model a
sports car in the Define phase you
define the requirements of the customer
based on inputs from customers
historical data industry research you
determine what you need to ensure your
car becomes a success the data collected
indicates customers are drawn to cars
which can achieve more than 150 miles
per hour customers are also more
inclined towards cars which have V6
engines and an aerodynamic frame then in
the measure phase you use the customer's
requirements to create a specification
this specification helps Define the
product in a measurable method so that
data can be collected and compared with
specific requirements some of the major
specifications that you focus on are the
top speed engine type and type of frame
in the analyze phase you analyze the
product to determine whether there are
better ways to achieve the desired
results areas of improvement are
determined and tested based on the
analysis of the Prototype created in
this phase do you find that the product
satisfies just about all of the customer
requirements except the top speed
so research begins on an aluminum alloy
that could possibly meet the speed
requirements of the customer following
this the design phase based on the
learnings from the analysis phase the
new process or product is designed
revisions are made to the model and the
car is manufactured with the new
material the analysis phase is repeated
based on the new design you also bring a
focus group and see how they receive it
based on their feedback further changes
are made and finally in the verify phase
you check whether the end result meets
or exceeds customer requirements once
you launch your brand new sports car you
collect customer feedback and
incorporate it into future designs and
guess what your customers are loving the
new design and that is DM ADV for you
Six Sigma has also found success in a
number of different Industries the
petrochemical healthcare banking
government and software are some of the
industries that have utilized the
concepts of Six Sigma to achieve their
business goals another commonly used
methodology adopted by companies around
the world is lean lean is a methodology
that aims to remove any part of the
process but does not bring value to the
customer it means doing more with less
while doing it better the philosophy
behind lean comes from the Japanese
manufacturing industry by Bob Hartman
who at the time was part of Toyota since
then across the world services and
Manufacturing organizations have
Incorporated lean Within their
businesses but what if you could have
the best of both worlds a combination of
both Six Sigma and length that's lean
Six Sigma
the organizational benefits of Six Sigma
are as follows a Six Sigma process
eliminates the root cause of problems
and defects in a process
sometimes the solution is creating
robust products and services that
mitigate the impact of a variable input
or output on a customer's experience for
example many Electrical Utility Systems
have voltage variability up to and
sometimes exceeding a 10 deviation from
nominal value thus most electrical
products are built to tolerate the
variability drawing more amperage
without damage to any components or the
unit itself
using Six Sigma reduces variation in a
process and thereby reduces waste in a
process
it ensures customer satisfaction and
provides process standardization
rework is substantially reduced because
one gets it right the very first time
further Six Sigma addresses the key
business requirement
Six Sigma can also be used by
organizations to gain advantage and
become world leaders in their respective
Fields ultimately the whole Six Sigma
process is to satisfy customers and
Achieve organizational goals
let us understand how Six Sigma Works in
this screen
Six Sigma is successful because of the
following reasons
Six Sigma is a management strategy it
creates an environment where the
management supports Six Sigma as a
business strategy and not as a
standalone approach or a program to
satisfy some public relations need
Six Sigma mainly emphasizes the DMACC
method of problem solving Focus teams
are assigned well-defined projects that
directly influence the organization's
bottom line with customer satisfaction
and increased quality being byproducts
Six Sigma also requires extensive use of
statistical methods imagine you're the
manager of a supermarket chain you've
noticed that two things need your
immediate attention the first issue is
how to handle the different kinds of
ways that you encounter at your
supermarket
the next one requires you to address the
supply chain issues at the supermarket
which are causing delays to the morning
delivery of milk
leading to customer dissatisfaction and
attrition these problems can be solved
by incorporating two of the most popular
quality management methodologies in the
world lean and Six Sigma one famous for
its ability to handle waste and another
known for process Improvement but what
if there was a methodology that combined
the concepts of both Six Sigma and Link
one that can solve all your issues well
there is lean Six Sigma before we dive
into lean Six Sigma let's take a closer
look at its parent methodologies
first off lean is a methodology that
focuses on providing value to the
customer
eliminating waste continuous Improvement
reducing cycle time lean in Six Sigma
both aim to handle waste but what is
this waste waste is any step or action
in the process that a user does not gain
any value from in short things that
users wouldn't want to pay for why would
a consumer want to pay extra for the
additional truck that was required to
deliver milk to the supermarket just
because the other one broke down
this waste can be divided into eight
categories let's have a look at each of
them One Transportation this waste
refers to the excess movement of people
tools inventory equipment and other
components of a process then it is
required
two inventory this waste occurs due to
having more products and materials than
required this can cause damage and
effects to products or materials greater
time for completion inefficient
allocation of capital and so on
3. motion this refers to the time and
effort wasted due to unnecessary
movement of people equipment or
Machinery this could be sitting through
inventory double data entry and so on
4. waiting this can be time wasted
waiting on information instructions
materials or equipment
five overproduction
this is the waste created due to
producing more products than required 6.
over processing it refers to more work
more components or more steps in a
product or service than required
7. defects this is the waste originating
from a product or service that fails to
meet customer expectations 8. skills
this waste refers to the waste of human
potential under utilizing capabilities
and delegating tasks to people with
inadequate training
for years now many systems have emerged
that use the lean methodology to
identify and handle the different kinds
of waste some of the more popular and
effective ones are jit or just in time
5s and kanban
the jit methodology focuses on reducing
the amount of time the production system
takes to provide an output and the
response time from suppliers to
customers 5S is another methodology that
focuses on cleanliness in organization
while improving profits and efficiency
kanban is also another popular
methodology to achieve Lane
it is a visual method to manage tasks
and workflows
kanban enables users visualize the
workflow to identify issues in the
process and fix them
these methodologies help in optimizing
the waste production and are often used
together to maximize results so that's
the first problem solved now let's have
a look at how you can improve the
supermarket supply chain efficiency for
that let's have a look at the other part
of lean Six Sigma Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a set of tools and
techniques that are used for process
Improvement and removing defects let's
see how Six Sigma makes that possible
Six Sigma has two major methodologies
dmaic and dmadv
you can learn more about these two
methodologies by checking out our Six
Sigma in nine minutes video by clicking
on the top right corner let's have a
closer look at dmaic since lean Six
Sigma uses the dmaic methodology of Six
Sigma dmaic is an acronym for Define
measure analyze improve control it is
used to improve existing products and
processes so that it can meet the
customers requirements
in the Define phase you determine what
the goals of the project are in this
case you want to reduce the amount of
time taken to deliver milk from the
warehouse to the supermarket so that it
is stocked on the supermarket shelves
before 8 30 in the morning
in the measure phase you measure the
performance of the current unaltered
process the milk truck leaves at 7 30 am
in the morning and can take one of three
routes a b and c Rel a is currently the
preferred one as it takes only 60
Minutes to reach the supermarket
compared to the routes B and C which
takes 70 and 80 minutes respectively
in the analyze phase you find out why
the defects exist
since routes B and C were school bus
routes by reducing the starting time by
one hour at 6 30 instead of 7 30 meant
avoiding the traffic routes B and C now
take 40 to 45 minutes to reach the
supermarket route a still takes the milk
truck one hour to get to the supermarket
even when the truck leaves at 6 30 am
in the improve phase performance can be
improved by addressing and eliminating
the root causes
now that you've realized that advancing
the milk pickup by an hour and changing
the route to Route B can save time you
change the process accordingly providing
your workers with ample time to stock
the milk into the shelves before the
morning rush and finally in the control
phase you make regular adjustments to
control new processes and future
performance
you continue to monitor the delivery
times and try out alternate routes to
continually improve the process and
ensure even faster delivery
this process change LED to reduced man
hours and cost enhanced cells and
customer retention the lean Six Sigma
methodology offers many such benefits to
businesses let's take a look at some of
them one increase in profits two
standardized and simplified process
three reduced errors
4. employee development five value to
customers and that is lean Six Sigma for
to make yojini more successful in Six
Sigma we introduce your postgraduate
program in lean Six Sigma by simply
learn so what are you waiting for grab
the course now find the course Link in
the description box the term lean refers
to creating more value to customers with
fewer resources it means reducing
unwanted activities or processes that do
not add value to the product or service
for the customer
the lean philosophy is to provide
perfect value to the customer through a
perfect value creation process that has
zero waste
while the ultimate goal is to achieve
zero waste you may not always get that
in the first couple of tries however you
will achieve minimum waste and continue
to move towards zero waste eventually
hence lean is the path towards
perfection
lean is about optimizing the process
from beginning to end eliminating
non-value-adding activities in va's and
increasing flow to ensure that parts and
services are provided to customers more
quickly
if quality is the word to describe Six
Sigma then speed is the word to describe
lean let's understand the importance of
lean
there are many benefits of lean and some
of them are reduced cost reduced cycle
time more throughput and increase
productivity
despite all of these benefits lean is
not implemented by most of the
organizations because of the
misconception that it is only suited in
manufacturing areas
the reason for this misconception is the
beginning of lean it began and grew in
popularity in the manufacturing areas
starting with Toyota
in recent years one can notice more
applications of lean in other areas such
as health care and the transactional
space
however the truth is that lean Concepts
can be applied in any business and in
any process
on the next screen let's discuss how
lean and Six Sigma combine
lean in Six Sigma are two different
principles or methodologies that combine
to form and create one powerful
continuous Improvement methodology
they have various overlapping goals
toward the improvement with the aim of
creating the most efficient system
though the approaches are different the
methods complement each other
lean Six Sigma takes the power and rigor
of Six Sigma methodology and combines it
with lean Concepts leading to faster
results better quality and improved
customer satisfaction
let's look at the differences between
lean and Six Sigma lean focuses on
efficiency by identifying value from the
customer's point of view removing
unnecessary steps in the process and
improving process speed or velocity
on the other hand Six Sigma focuses on
Effectiveness with the help of
breakthrough processes identifying root
causes and reduction in variation
therefore when six sigmas combine with
lean it is possible to achieve business
transformation
so remember lean is about speed with a
focus on efficiency Six Sigma is about
quality with a focus on Effectiveness
and lean Six Sigma brings the best of
both together
peeled a better result first Implement
lean to streamline the process this
helps to understand the chronic problems
and the ways to handle them quickly
once the problem is identified use six
singular methodology to analyze the
issues and provide business Improvement
transformation
in other words lean is used to reduce
the waste and Six Sigma is used to
reduce the variation let us start with
an introduction to Six Sigma in the
following screen
sex Sigma is a highly disciplined
process that focuses on delivering near
perfect products and services
consistently
its strength is that it's a continuous
improvement process with an unwavering
focus on change empowerment seamless
training of resources and continuous top
management support
these three are known as the pillars of
Six Sigma if Six Sigma is implemented
methodically it will give sustained
results for any process
now the question arises as to what is a
process this will be explained in the
next screen
a process is a series of steps designed
to produce a product and or service
according to the requirement of the
customer
a process mainly consists of four parts
input process steps output and feedback
input is something put into a process or
expended in its operation to achieve an
output or a result
for example man material machine and
management
output is the final product delivered to
an internal or external customer for
example product or services
it is important to understand that if
the output of a process is an input for
another process the latter process is
the internal customer
each input can be classified as
controllable represented as C
non-controllable represented as NC noise
represented as n and critical
represented as X
the most important aspect of the process
is the feedback
as can be inferred from the image any
change in the inputs causes change in
the output
therefore y equals f of x
feedback helps in process control
because it suggests changes to the
inputs
let us learn about the process of Six
Sigma in the next screen
let us understand how Six Sigma Works in
this screen
sex Sigma is successful because of the
following reasons Six Sigma is a
management strategy it creates an
environment where the management
supports Six Sigma as a business
strategy and not as a standalone
approach or a program to satisfy some
public relations need
Six Sigma mainly emphasizes the DMACC
method of problem solving
Focus teams are assigned well-defined
projects that directly influence the
organization's bottom line with customer
satisfaction and increased quality being
byproducts Six Sigma also requires
extensive use of statistical methods
the next screen will focus on some key
terms used in Six Sigma
let us look at the segment level chart
in this screen
as discussed earlier the Six Sigma
quality means 3.4 defects in 1 million
opportunities or process with a
99.9966 percent yield the sigma level
chart given on the screen shows the
values for other Sigma levels please
take a look at the values carefully
let us understand the benefits of Six
Sigma in the next screen
the organizational benefits of Six Sigma
are as follows a Six Sigma process
eliminates the root cause of problems
and defects in a process
sometimes the solution is creating
robust products and services that
mitigate the impact of a variable input
or output on a customer's experience for
example many Electrical Utility Systems
have voltage variability up to and
sometimes exceeding a 10 deviation from

variation in a process and thereby
reduces waste in a process
it ensures customer satisfaction and

further Six Sigma addresses the key
business requirement
Six Sigma can also be used by
organizations to gain advantage and
become world leaders in their respective
Fields ultimately the whole Six Sigma
process is to satisfy customers and
Achieve organizational goals in the next
screen let us understand Six Sigma and
quality
taking a process to Six Sigma level
ensures that the quality of the product
is maintained the primary goal of
improved quality is increased profits
for the organization
in very simple terms quality is defined
as the degree of Excellence of a product
or a service provided to the customer it
is conformance to customer requirement
if the customer is satisfied with the
product or service then the product or
service is of the required quality
let us look at the history of quality in
the next screen in the mid-1930s
statistical process control SPC was
developed by Walter schuhart and used
extensively during World War II to
quickly expand the US's industrial
capabilities
SPC is the application of statistical
techniques to control any process
Walter shoe Hearts work on the common
cause of variation and special cause of
variation assignable has been used
proactively in all Six Sigma projects
the approach to Quality has varied from
time to time in the 1960s there were
quality circles which originated in
Japan it was started by Kaoru Ishikawa
quantity circles were self-improvement
groups composed a small number of
employees belonging to a single
Department
quality circles brought in improvements
with little or no help from the top
management
in 1987 ISO 9000 was introduced
ISO stands for International
Organization for standardization
ISO 9000 is a set of international
standards on quality management and
quality assurance to help organizations
Implement Quality Management Systems ISO
9000 is still in effect
baldrige award now known as the Malcolm
Baldridge National Quality award was
developed by the U.S Congress in 1987 to
raise awareness of Quality Management
Systems as well as recognize and award
U.S companies that have successfully
implemented Quality Management Systems
in 1988 another quality approach was
developed known as benchmarking in this
approach an organization measures its
performance against the best
organizations in its field determines
how such performance levels were
achieved and the information is used by
the organization to improve itself
then in the 1990s there was the balance
scorecard approach it is a management
tool that helps managers of all levels
to monitor their results in their key
areas so that one metric is not
optimized while another is ignored
during the year 1996 through 1997 an
approach known as re-engineering was
developed this approach involved the
restructuring of an entire organization
and its processes
integrating various functional tasks
into cross-functional processes is one
of the examples of re-engineering
in the next screen let us find out about
the quality gurus and their contribution
to the field of quality
let us focus on Six Sigma and the
business system in this screen
business systems are designed to
implement a process or a set of
processes a business system ensures that
process inputs are at the right place
and at the right time so that each step
of the process has the resource it needs
a business system designed should be
responsible for collecting and analyzing
data so that continual Improvement of
its processes products and services is
insured a business system has processes
sub-processes and steps as it subsets
Human Resources manufacturing and
marketing are some examples of processes
in a business system
Six Sigma improves a business system by
continuously removing the defects in its
processes and also by sustaining the
changes a defective item is any product
or service that a customer would reject
a customer can be the user of the
ultimate product or service or can be
the next process Downstream in the
business system let us learn about Six
Sigma projects and organizational goals
in the following screen
let us understand the structure of the
Six Sigma team in this screen
there are totally five levels in the Six
Sigma screen the first level consists of
the top Executives of the organization
these people lead change and provide
direction as they own the vision of the
organization
for any Improvement initiative to work
it is important that top management of
the organization be actively involved in
its propagation the top Executives own
the Six Sigma initiatives next in the
level are Six Sigma Champions they
identify and scope projects develop
deployment and strategy and support
cultural change
they also identify and Coach master
black belts three to four Master block
belts work under every champion
Six Sigma Master black belts train and
Coach black belts green belts and
various functional leaders of the
organization
they usually have at least three to four
black belts under them the fourth level
in Six Sigma structure is Six Sigma
Black belts they apply strategies to
specific projects and lead in direct
teams to execute projects
finally there are Six Sigma Green belts
they support the black belt employees by
participating in Project teams green
belts play a dual role they work on the
project and perform day-to-day jobs
related to their work area
in the next screen we will understand
the drivers and metrics of
organizational strategy
while financial accounting is useful to
track physical assets the balanced
scorecard or BSE offers a more holistic
approach to strategy implementation and
performance measurement by taking into
account perspectives other than the
financial one for an organization
traditional strategic activities that
concentrate only on financial metrics
are not sufficient to predict future
performance they are not sufficient to
implement and control the Strategic plan
either BSE translates the organizational
strategy into actionable objectives that
can be met on an everyday basis and
provides a framework for performance
measurement the balance scorecard helps
clarify the organizational vision and
Mission to workable action items to be
carried out and measured it also
provides feedback on both internal
business processes and external outcomes
by doing so it enables continuous
Improvement in strategic performance
toward achieving organizational goals
the balanced scorecard achieves all this
by integrating the organizational
strategy with a limited number of key
metrics from four major areas of
performance Finance customer relations
internal processes and learning and
growth
many organizations in the world use
balanced scorecard approaches and the
number is increasing every day
in the next screen we will describe the
balanced scorecard framework we will
learn about developing a balanced
scorecard in this screen while applying
the balance scorecard in an organization
care must be taken to account for
interactions between different
perspectives or strategic business units
and avoid optimizing the results of one
at the expense of another
to outline the strategy a top-down
approach is followed by determining the
Strategic objectives measures targets
and initiatives for each perspective
the Strategic objectives refer to the
strategy to be achieved in that
perspective three or four leading
objectives are agreed upon the progress
towards strategic objectives is assessed
using specific measures these measures
should be closely related to the actual
performance drivers this enables
effectively evaluating progress
high-level metrics are linked to lower
level operational measures the target
values for each measure are set the
initiatives required to achieve the
target value are identified
as already mentioned this exercise is
carried out for all the perspectives
finally the scorecard is integrated into
the management system
in the next screen let us understand the
change in the approach to the balance
scorecard from the four Box model of BSE
to strategy Maps
in earlier approaches to the balanced
scorecard the perspectives were
presented in a four Box model this kind
of scorecard was more a comprehensive
glance at the key performance indicators
or metrics in different perspectives
however the key performance indicators
or metrics of different perspectives
reviewed independent of each other which
led to a silo based approach and lack of
integration
however modern scorecards place the
focus on the interrelations between the
objectives and metrics of different
perspectives and how they support each
other
a well-designed balanced scorecard
recognizes the influence of one
perspective on another and the effect of
these interactions on organizational
strategy
to achieve the objectives in one
perspective it is necessary to achieve
the objectives in another perspective in
short the four perspectives form a chain
of cause and effect relationships a map
of interlinked objectives from each
perspective is created these objectives
represents the performance drivers which
determine the effectiveness of strategy
implementation this is called a strategy
map
the function of a strategy map is to
outline what the organization wants to
accomplish and how it plans to
accomplish it the strategy map is one
page view of how the organization can
create value the for example financial
success is dependent on giving customers
what they want which in turn depends on
the internal processes and learning and
growth at an individual level in the
next screen we will look at the impact
of the balance scorecard on the
organization
the balance scorecard and strategy map
Force managers to consider cause and
effect relationships which leads to
better identification of key drivers and
a more rounded approach to strategic
planning the BSC enables the
organization to improve in the following
ways
being a one-page document a strategy map
can easily be communicated and
facilitates understanding at all levels
of the organization
an organization is successful in meeting
its objectives only when everyone
understands the strategy
the balance scorecard also forces an
organization to measure what really
matters and manage information better so
that quality of decision making is
higher creating performance reports
against a balanced scorecard allows for
a structured approach to reporting
progress it also enables organizations
to create reports and dashboards to
communicate performance transparently
and meaningfully as expected a balanced
scorecard helps an organization to
better align itself and its processes to
the Strategic goals outlined in the BSE
the overall objectives of the BSE can be
cascaded into each business unit to
enable that unit to work toward the
common organizational goal
all the activities of the organization
such as budgeting or risk management are
automatically aligned to the Strategic
objectives to conclude the balance
scorecard is a simple and Powerful tool
that when implemented correctly equips
an organization to perform better
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following screen
in this topic we will look at what lean
is and how lean is applied to a process
let us start with the lean Concepts in
the next screen let us look at the
process issues in this screen
lean focuses on three major issues in a
process known by their Japanese names
muda mura and Murray muda refers to
non-value adding work mura represents
unevenness and Marie represents
overburden together they represent the
key aspects in lean let us look at the
types of waste in the next screen
there are seven types of muda or waste
as per lean principles let us understand
these seven types of muda over
production this refers to producing more
than is required for example a customer
needed 10 products and 12 were delivered
inventory in simple words this refers to
stock
the term inventory includes finished
goods semi-finished Goods raw materials
supplies kept in waiting and some of the
work in progress for example test
scripts waiting to be executed by the
testing team defects repairs rejects any
product or service deemed unusable by
the customer or any effort to make it
usable to the original customer or a new
customer for example errors found in the
source code of a payroll module by
quality control team motion a waste due
to poor ergonomics of the workplace for
example finance and account team sit on
the first floor but invoices to
customers are printed on the ground
floor causing unnecessary Personnel
movement
over processing additional process on a
product or service to remove unnecessary
attribute or feature is over processing
for example a customer needs a bottle
and you deliver a bottle with extra
plastic casing a customer needs abec3
bearing and your process is tuned to
produce more precise adec 7 bearings
taking more time for something the
customer doesn't need
waiting when a part waits for processing
or the operator waits for work the
wastage of waiting occurs for example
improper scheduling of Staff members
transport when the product moves
unnecessarily in the process without
adding value
for example a product is finished and
yet it travels 10 kilometers to the
warehouse before it gets shipped to the
customer another example an electronic
form is transferred to 12 people some of
them seeing the form more than once that
is the form is traveling over the same
space multiple times
next we will look at lean waste other
than the seven types of waste discussed
some lean experts talk about additional
areas of waste under utilized skills
skills are underutilized when the
workforce has capabilities that are not
being fully used toward productive
efforts people are assigned to jobs in
which they do not fit
underperforming processes automation of
poorly performing process improving a
process that should be eliminated if
possible for example the product returns
department or product discounts process
a symmetry in processes that should be
eliminated for example two signatures to
approve a cost reduction and six
signatures to reverse a cost reduction
that created higher costs in other areas
in the next screen we will look at an
exercise on identifying the waste type
we will cover each step of the lean
process in the next few screens in this
screen we will learn about the first
step identify value to implement lean to
a process it is important to find out
what the customer wants once this is
done the process should be evaluated to
identify what it needs to possess to
meet customer requirements
the next screen will focus on the next
step of the lean process value stream
mapping
in this screen we will discuss the
differences between push and pull
processes an organization can adopt
either of these processes depending on
the requirement
contrary to a pull process in a push
process the first step is to forecast
the demand for a product or service the
production line then begins to fill this
demand and produced parts are stocked in
anticipation of customer demand for
example a garments manufacturer produces
200 shirts based on expected demand and
then waits for customer orders for them
note that the demand is expected and not
actual discounts offered to customers by
big retailers are examples of the push
process
if the Garment company adopts a pull
process instead it would start making
the shirts only after receiving a
confirmed demand from customers note
that although the full approach seems
better it is not applicable to all
situations for example a pharmacy uses a
push process
in the next screen we will learn about
theory of constraints
let us look at an example for the TOC
methodology in this screen
the three sub processes in the packing
process are coding or printing filling
and sealing the data for the three sub
processes are observed and collected as
number of units produced in an hour
the data is as follows
coding or printing is 900 units per hour
filling is 720 units per hour and
ceiling is 780 units per hour
how can you implement the TOC
methodology in this example
let us build the TOC map for this
example the first step in the TOC
methodology is to identify the
constraint looking at the data the
output per hour from The Filling process
is 720. this is the constraint in the
system
in the Second Step the constraint is
exploited by analyzing the performance
using data to break the constraint a
repair and maintenance Personnel can be
assigned to maintain the filling machine
on a daily basis
in the third step the other fixes in the
repair and maintenance function are made
as subordinate decisions to the one
taken in step two in this example carry
out the maintenance of the filling
machine in the fourth step the
constraint is elevated by implementing
the decisions in this example remove the
damages from the filling machine
the next step is to go back to step one
and identify the next system constraint
as per the data collected after
implementation of the first cycle of the
TOC ceiling can be identified as the
next system constraint
let us now analyze the data before and
after Toc implementation in this example
the number of units produced per hour
before implementing the TOC encoding or
printing process was 900 units filling
process was 720 units and sealing
process was 780 units
after implementing the TOC the number of
units produced per hour for the filling
process increased to 840 from 720 units
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in this topic we will discuss the
concepts in design for Six Sigma or dfss
let us first understand dfss in the next
screen
dfss or design for Six Sigma is a
business process methodology that
ensures that any new product or service
meets customer requirements and the
process for that product or service is
already at Six Sigma level
dfss uses tools such as Quality Function
deployment or qfd and failure mode and
effects analysis or FMEA
dfss can help a business system to
introduce an entirely new product or
service for the customer
it can also be used to introduce a new
category of product or service for the
business system for example an fmcg
company plans to make a new brand of
hair oil a type of product already in
the market
dfss also improves the product or
service and adds to the current product
or service lines to implement dfss a
business system has to know its customer
requirements
dfss can be used to design a new product
or service a new process for a new
product or service or redesign of an
existing product or service to meet
customer requirements
let us learn about processes for dfss in
the next screen
the two major processes for dfss are
idov and dmadv
idov stands for identify design optimize
and verify
dma DB stands for Define measure analyze
design and verify
in the idov process the first step
involves identifying specific customer
needs based on which the new product and
business process will be designed the
next step involves design which involves
identifying functional requirements
developing alternate Concepts evaluating
the Alternatives selecting a best fit
concept and predicting Sigma capability
tools such as FMEA are used here the
third step optimize uses a statistical
approach to calculate tolerance with
respect to the desired output
when idov is implemented to design a
process expected to work at Six Sigma
level this is checked in the optimize
phase
if the process does not meet
expectations the optimize phase helps in
developing detailed design elements
predicting performances and optimizing
design
the last stage of idov is to verify that
is to test and validate the design and
finally to check conformance to Six
Sigma standards
the other process dmadv has five stages
the first stage is to define the
customer requirements and goals for the
process product or service
next measure and match performance to
customer requirements the third stage
involves analysis and assessment of the
design for the process product or
service the next step is to design and
implement the array of latest processes
required for the new process product or
service
the final stage is to verify results and
maintain performance
in the next screen we will look at the
differences between idov and dmad
the primary difference between idov and
dma DB is that while idov is used only
to design a new product or service dma
DB can be used to design either a new
product or service or redesign an
existing product or service
idov involves design of a new process
while dmadv involves redesigning an
existing process in idov no analysis or
measurement of existing process is done
and the whole development is new the
design step immediately follows the
identification of customer requirements
in contrast dmadv the existing product
service or process is examined
thoroughly before moving to the design
phase
the design stage comes only after
defining requirements and analyzing the
existing product service or process
in the following screen we will learn
about tool Quality Function deployment
or qfd which is one of the dfss tools
qfd also called voice of customer or VOC
or House of quality is a predefined
method of identifying customer
requirements it is a systematic process
to understand the needs of the customer
and convert them into a set of design
and Manufacturing requirements
qfd motivates business to focus on its
customers and design products that are
competitive in lesser time and at lesser
cost
the primary learning from qfd includes
which customer requirements are most
important well the organization's
strengths and weaknesses are where an
organization should focus their efforts
and where most of the work needs to be
done
to learn from qfd the organization
should ask relevant questions to
customers and tabulate them to bring out
a set of parameters critical to the
design of the product
apart from understanding customer
requirements it is also important to
know what would happen if a particular
product or service fails when being used
by a customer
it is necessary to understand the
effects of failure on the customer to
ensure preventive actions are taken and
to be able to answer the customers in
the event of failure
in the next screen we will look at
another dfss tool failure modes and
effects analysis or FMEA
failure modes and effects analysis or
FMEA is a preemptive tool that helps any
system to identify potential pitfalls at
all levels of a business system it helps
the organization to identify and
prioritize the different failure modes
of its product or service and what
effect the failure would have on the
customer it helps in identifying the
critical areas in a system on which the
organization's efforts can be focused
note that while FMEA enables
identification of critical areas it does
not offer solutions to the identified
problems we will look at the varieties
of FMEA such as dfmea and pfmea in the
next screen
pfmea stands for process failure mode
and effects analysis and dfmea stands
for design failure mode and effects
analysis
pfmea is used on a new or existing
process to uncover potential failures it
is done in the quality planning phase to
act as an aid during production a
process FMEA can involve fabrication
assembly transactions or services
dfmea is used in the design of a new
product service or process to uncover
potential failures the purpose is to
find out how failure modes affect the
system and to reduce the effect of
failure on the system this is done
before the product is sent to
manufacturing all design deficiencies
are sorted out at the end of this
process in the following screen we will
understand FMEA risk priority number
FMEA risk priority number or RPM is a
measure used to quantify or assess risk
associated with the design or process
assessing risk helps identify critical
failure modes higher the rpn higher the
priority the product or process receives
rpn is a product of three numbers
severity of a failure occurrence of a
failure and the detectability of a
failure
all these numbers are given a value on a
scale of one to ten the minimum value of
rpn is one and the maximum value is one
thousand a failure mode with a high
occurrence rating means the failure mode
occurs very frequently
a mode with a high severity rating means
that the mode is really critical to
ensure safety of operations
a mode with a high detection rating
means that the current controls are not
sufficient
in the next screen we will look at the
FMEA table
the FMEA table helps plan Improvement
initiatives by underlining why and how
failure modes occur and helps
organizations plan for their prevention
typically FMEA is applied on the output
of root cause analysis and is a better
tool for Focus or prioritization as
compared to multi-voting one important
aspect of FMEA is that it does not need
data
experts in a particular area can form
the FMEA table without having to look at
data from any source in functions such
as human resources the FMEA table is
very useful as there might not be much
data available to the problem-solving
team
the sample FMEA table is given on the
screen please go through the contents
for better understanding
in the following screen we will discuss
severity of risk priority number and
scale criteria
let us first discuss severity
severity refers to the seriousness of
the effect of the failure mode or how
critical the failure mode is to the
customer or the process
the severity of a failure mode is rated
on a scale of 1 to 10 using a severity
table
different Industries follow different
structures for the severity table
a high severity rating indicates a mode
is critical to operational safety
for example a team working on FMEA of a
radioactive plant May insert fatal as
the effect with rating 10. another
example is the severity table for a
sports team
the team manager wants to rate the
severity of failure of the team in an
upcoming game
she might rate it at nine given that the
team would lose a big sponsorship should
they face defeat which could in turn be
hazardous to the team's future
shown here is a generalized table of
severity
the severity rating can never be changed
for example if a mode has a rating of 9
before Improvement it will continue to
have a rating of 9 after Improvement two
let us look at occurrence of RPM and
scale criteria
occurrence is the probability that a
specific cause will result in the
particular failure mode
as with severity occurrences rated on a
scale of 1 to 10 based on a table
like the severity table higher the
occurrence of a failure higher is its
rating again this table might vary
depending on the industry and scenario
sometimes the project team can use data
here if available
based on past data the probability of
occurrence of a failure can easily be
rated shown here is a generalized table
let us next look at detection of rpn and
scale criteria
detection is the probability that a
particular failure will be detected
the table shown here is again a
generalized one the rating here is a bit
different from severity or occurrence
higher the detectability of a failure
lower is its rating this is because if
the failure can easily be detected then
everyone would know of it and therefore
there would be less or no damage for
example if detection is impossible the
failure is given a rating of 10. please
note that at the start of a Six Sigma
project the failure mode is given a
relatively High detection rating let us
look at an example of FMEA and rpn in
the next screen
in this example A Bank wants to
recognize and prioritize the risks
involved in the process of withdrawing
cash from an ATM it can be observed from
the table that not having a control in
place for network issues has the highest
rpn this is due to the detectability for
a network issue being very low the next
set of information in the table shows
the action taken by the bank's
management to address the failure modes
following the implementation the new rpn
is calculated retaining the security
level at nine this is because the
actions were not directed at reducing
the severity but at the causes of
failure it can be seen that the new rpn
is much lower and the risk for both
causes has been mitigated
to make your journey more successful in
Six Sigma we introduce your postgraduate
program in lean Six Sigma by simply love
so what are you waiting for grab the
course now find the course Link in the
description box this lesson will cover
the details of the Define phase
let us start with the objectives of the
lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to explain various components of
project identification
describe customer data collection
methods list various means of project
documentation
discuss risk analysis and management
describe project management and planning
tools
explain the concepts used in evaluation
of project performance
discuss team stages and Dynamics
let us start with the first Topic in the
following screen
in this topic we will discuss project
identification
let us see the prerequisites of a Six
Sigma project in the following screen
Six Sigma can be applied to everything
around it can be applied across almost
70 different sectors however it cannot
be applied to all problems the first
step is to check if the project
qualifies to be a Six Sigma project
the questions that need to be asked are
as follows
is there an existing process to
implement the DMACC methodology of
problem solving a process needs to exist
the six signal process is known as
Dometic
demand comprises five phases Define
measure analyze improve and control
these phases are the roadmap to problem
solving and improving our processes
the effectiveness of Six Sigma method is
derived from its structure
each phase has an overarching objective
and specific deliverables that need to
be completed which helps us achieve the
objectives the purpose of the Define
phase is to document the problem the
desired outcome goals and deliverables
the purpose of the measure phase is to
obtain Baseline process performance
levels and quantify the problem the
focus of the analyze phase is to
identify the key root causes for process
variation and defects the purpose of the
improved phase is to develop test and
implement the solutions
the goal of the control phase is to
monitor the key factors and maintain the
gains you learn the aspects of the
domainic process now we'll look at the
tools used in each phase the list of
tools corresponds to the Dometic phase
in which they are used
the use or application of these tools
gives the expected deliverables in each
Dometic phase for a green belt some of
the tools listed are not required in
every Six Sigma Greenbelt project
these tools give us an insight into the
problem and lead us toward the real
issues in our processes that is with
more experience you are likely to know
the tools you need for your projects
in the Define phase we use cypok voice
of the customer or VOC critical to
quality ctq the quality function
deployment or qfd failure modes and
effects analysis
known as the FMEA or the familiar and
the cause and effect CNE Matrix
in the measure phase we use measurement
system analysis or MSA control charts
process capability and normality plots
and the analyze phase we use Simple
linear regression or SLR Pareto charts
fishbone diagram Builder modes and
effects analysis The Familiar
multivariate charts and hypothesis
testing
in the improved phase we use
brainstorming piloting and also the
failure modes effects analysis and
design of experiments Doe
in the last phase control will use
control charts a control plan and
measurement system analysis
Pareto chart is a histogram ordered by
the frequency of occurrence of events it
is also known as the 80 20 rule or vital
view trivial many
it helps project teams to focus on the
issues which cause the highest number of
defects or complaints
to explain further the given chart plots
all the causes for defects in a product
or service the values are represented in
descending order by bars and the
cumulative total is represented by the
line
Pareto chart emphasizes that 80 percent
of the effects come from 20 percent of
the causes thus a Pareto chart Narrows
the scope of the project or problem
solving by identifying the major causes
affecting quality
burrito charts are useful only when
required data is available
if data is not available then other
tools such as brainstorming and
multi-voting should be used to find the
root cause of any problem
Network diagrams are one of the tools
used by the project manager for project
planning they are also sometimes
referred to as Arrow diagrams because
they use arrows to connect activities
and represent precedence and
interdependencies between activities of
a project
there are some assumptions that need to
be made while forming the network
diagram the first assumption is that
before a new activity begins all pending
activities have been completed
the second assumption is that all arrows
indicate logical precedence
this means that the direction of the
arrow represents the sequence that
activities need to follow
the last assumption is that a network
diagram must start from a single event
and end with a single event there cannot
be multiple start and end points to the
network diagram
critical path method also known as CPM
is an important tool used by project
managers to monitor the progress of the
project and to ensure that the project
is on schedule
the critical path for a project is the
longest sequence of tasks on the network
diagram the critical path in the given
Network diagram is highlighted in Orange
critical path is characterized by zero
slack for all tasks on the sequence
this means that the smallest delay in
any of the tasks on the critical path
will cause a delay in the overall
timeline of the project
this makes it very important for the
project manager to closely monitor the
tasks on the critical path and ensure
that the tasks go smoothly if needed the
project manager can divert resources
from other tasks that are not on the
critical path to task on the critical
path to ensure that the project is not
delayed
when a project manager removes resources
from such tasks he needs to ensure that
the task does not become a critical path
task because of the reduced number of
resources
during the execution of the project the
critical path can easily shift because
of multiple factors and hence needs to
be constantly monitored by the project
manager
a complex project can also have multiple
critical paths here we wrap up this

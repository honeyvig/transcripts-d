What I've always done in
the last many years is I will give you my
advice as a leader inside a company, but
then I will also give you my advice as an
individual. And I think, to me, that's been
one of the things that I think has bonded
people to me over the years.
[MUSIC]
>> Hi Everyone.
Welcome to Behind the Tech.
I'm your host, Kevin Scott,
Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.
In this podcast,
we're going to get behind the tech.
We'll talk with some of the people who have
made our modern tech world possible and
understand what motivated
them to create what they did.
So join me to maybe learn a little bit
about the history of computing and get a
few behind-the-scenes insights
into what's happening today.
Stick around.
[MUSIC]
>> Hello and
welcome to Behind the Tech.
>> I'm Christina Warren,
Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.
>> And
I'm Kevin Scott.
Today, we're going to be talking to a person that I have
long admired, Bill Coughran.
I met Bill when I was a young engineer at
Google, and he was one of the executives
running all of the very
important bits there.
Ultimately, Bill went on to run Search,
Infrastructure, Security, Maps, Local, so
this huge swath of all of the big,
complicated, important things at Google.
And like in a prior life, he'd been an
entrepreneur, he helped run a networking
company, and before that he had been a
computer science professor and was at
Bell Labs running the computing sciences
research division during a period where
they invented things like
the C++ programming language.
So, I still to this day am slightly in
awe of Bill, and he is the engineering
executive I would like
to be when I grow up.
(Laughter.)
>>
I don't blame you.
>> So, I'm curious, Christina.
Just like everyone else that is on
the show, including me, you've had not
necessarily a straightforward
path into technology.
I was just wondering, like, you know, can
you tell us a little bit about what that
path has been and which mentors you've had
to help guide you as you sort of figured
out your own journey?
>>
Yeah, definitely.
So, before I joined Microsoft, I worked in
media for a decade, and I was a journalist
and an analyst and reported mostly
on technology and business stuff.
So, I did have tech and I've always had an
interest in tech, but it was obviously a
different perspective.
And what's kind of great when you ask about
mentors, I think my -- probably my biggest
mentor would be a man
whose name is Jim Roberts
He was my editor-in-chief at Mashable for
a time, and he previously was the deputy
managing editor of the New York Times, and
he's now currently the editor-in-chief and
chief content
officer at Cheddar.
And just he's got like this
great longstanding like old-school
journalism career.
But what I love about Jim is A) we used to
fight all the time, so he really kind of
pushed me, right?
Like we used to
fight all the time.
But B) he saw what was happening to the
media landscape, and he decided that he
wasn't just going to
sit back and not evolve.
You know, he was early on Twitter, he
was early on embracing social and digital
platforms, and really pushed to get the New
York Times online and to make -- to bring
the two divisions that used to be
separate, like to bring the print
and the online part together.
And so, when I switched careers, he was
somebody that I kind of looked at, because
he -- even though he didn't switch careers,
was willing to evolve and wasn't just
going to stand back and hope that things
continued the way that it'd always been.
And so, even though we used to always
fight, like I learned so much from him, and
I continue to learn
so much from him.
>> Yeah, the thing that really
always amazes me and inspires me about
people who are willing to spend their time
mentoring others is that-- these people
have extraordinary generosity in sort of
taking the time and then sort of sharing
their perspective.
And like to be a good mentor, I mean,
it sounds like because you guys were like
fighting all the time,
like that requires a lot of energy.
Like that means that he cared enough about
you and your success and what you were
doing that he was willing to like
fully engage with you and push,
which is not an easy thing to do.
>> Not at all.
And I have to say the most gratifying
thing is that in recent years he's actually
reached out to me for my input on different
things, which has just felt amazing.
And I know that I can do
the same with him, so yeah.
>> Yeah,
I bet that is -- that's really awesome.
And one of the things that we're going to
hear in my conversation with Bill is like
Bill was one of the most influential
mentors in shaping my career path.
Like there were many, many moments where
the advice that Bill gave me was perhaps
the pivotal thing in like these very
pivotal decisions that had these sort of
long-term repercussions for my life, and my
family, and the people that I worked with.
And you know he was incredibly busy at the
time, and like he was incredibly senior
relative to me.
He somehow or another decided to
take the time, like and I will --
I will always be grateful for him.
And I've sort of had the same thing with
Bill that, you know, it sounds like you
have with your mentor where, I will try to
return the favor to Bill and like help him
out with some things
that he's working on.
But like maybe the -- you know, sort of the
biggest reciprocity there is that I was so
moved and so appreciative by what Bill was
willing to do for me that like I try to do
the same thing for other folks.
He's really informed like my philosophy on
coaching and how I give advice to people,
and like he's one of the reasons why I
more often than not will say, you know, yes
when someone asks me for like a
little tiny slice of time for advice.
>> I love that.
I love that so much.
And I -- I can't
wait to meet Bill.
>> Yeah, it's awesome. So let's go ahead
and chat with Bill.
[MUSIC]
>> So,
next up we'll meet with Bill Coughran.
Bill is one of my
engineering heroes.
He's a researcher, teacher, entrepreneur,
and business executive whose career
includes big jobs like head of the
computing sciences research division at
Bell Labs, the birthplace of UNIX, the C
and C++ programming languages and other
technologies that are foundations
of our modern tech world.
And Bill was SVP of Search,
Infrastructure, Maps and Local at Google.
Bill is now a partner at Sequoia
where he invests in, advises, and coaches
tech entrepreneurs.
[MUSIC]
>> The thing that I think
everybody will tell you about Bill is he is
just by temperament and depth of knowledge
one of the best people in the world to work
with as an engineer.
And everybody who's ever worked for Bill
wants to continue to work for Bill as long
as they possibly can.
I'm thrilled that you
are here with us today.
I've been hesitant to ask you to come on
because we've had lots and lots of people
on the show, you in some ways are
the most intimidating one because
I admire you so much. (Laughter.)
>> You're very
kind, Kevin.
Thank you for the invitation.
And I also, as I think you and some of the
audience probably knows, I don't spend a
lot of time doing public things.
But with a kind invitation,
I'm very pleased to be here.
>> Yeah,
and we're delighted.
So, I really want to
get into your story.
So,
you got your PhD in computer science --
>> Yes.
>> -- from Stanford.
>> No, I finished my
PhD and then I went to Bell Labs.
I did do work as a commercial programmer
while I was at Caltech, but that was a side
job. But I went to Bell Labs and I did
a lot of work in fluid modeling and
semiconductor modeling early on.
And then became interested in what today
would be called distributed computing and
kind of shifted to that.
And then I was asked at some point to
become the leader of a group, and then
ended up I stepped up a few steps
and ended up as the head of the
computing science research center.
>> So how did
that transition go for you?
I mean, I've always been interested in this
because you know I think the people who
have worked for you and with you admire
both your ability as a like a technical
leader as well as your
technical ability.
And, like, those two things
don't always go hand in hand.
>> Some people think
they're inversely proportional.
(Laughter.) The -- it's interesting,
I've always tried to read and
explore different technology areas.
My sense is, Kevin,
you're the same.
And so I try to stay conversant.
I also try to develop relationships with
people that I work with who I believe are
experts in the areas that they
understand more deeply than I do.
And I just try to synthesize as much as I
can, but over the years, I've also learned
like it's silly of me to descend into the
code in a major project because I can't
contribute that -- in that way
anymore, but I can think about
how does it fit in end to end?
What are the constraints
it's operating under?
You know?
There are often big choices about what
to do in terms of the basic algorithmic
approach and so forth.
And I try to stay
current with that.
But over the years, it's funny, I shifted
away from the numerical modeling stuff,
even though it's sort of come back in the
form of machine learning and became much
more deep on the
distributed systems side.
But you can learn new things.
One of the things that always amused me
when I ended up at Google was I had never
worked on a Web service before
I joined Google in early 2003.
And yet, somehow, over a fairly short
period of time, I became responsible for
the engineering associated
with Google.com.
So, you know, it appears old
dogs can occasionally learn
new tricks, so -- (Laughter.)
>> I think
you're being very modest.
(Laughter.) But you -- you've done all
this work in distributed computing and like
you had founded a
network company.
So, like you had tons of very relevant
experience at how to build, like,
high-scale systems.
>> Well, so what happened to
me, so I started life at Bell Labs very
much in the research mold.
So, success was writing papers and
giving talks and what was a very
academic style, success metric.
Over the years at Bell Labs, I felt like
I was going to conferences and seeing the
same subset of 3- to 500
people over and over again.
And I got a little bit frustrated
with my ability to impact things.
And so, I guess somewhere along -- during
my run at Bell Labs, I decided to get more
commercial. So, I took over as a general
manager of a business that we started as
well as the computing science research
center, and I tried to start to think more
about what's involved with
actually building products
and doing sales and so forth.
And so, we decided to try to put a Bell
Labs in Silicon Valley near Stanford.
And so I came out to do that in late 1998
or 1999 and what I ran into I think is a
little bit of what we see today in the
Valley, which was it was just a very frothy
time. It was before the dot-com bubble
burst and you know, people were funding
stuff that probably didn't make a lot of
sense, but there was a lot of money chasing
after ideas and
eyeballs at that time.
And I was trying to establish this
sort of more traditional research lab.
And after trying to do it for a year and a
half or so, I threw in the towel and went
off with a colleague to found a small
startup in the area that was doing a
telecommunications
system project.
And I was the CEO,
he was the CTO.
And we built that company up from the two
of us to about 140 people and then I -- we
brought in a CEO to do
the go-to-market side.
I left and was going to start another
company and then some old Bell Labs
colleagues called me and said we needed
adult supervision at Google, and that's
kind of how I
ended up at Google.
>> So, how did you get interested
in technology in the first place?
>> So, I'm old enough that I
think we call ourselves "baby boomers" now,
but at least when I was a kid, we were
part of the -- what was then known as the
"Sputnik" generation, which were
people who -- you know, the U.S.
was responding to the space race with the
then Soviet Union, and there was a lot of
interest in science.
And so, from a very early age, I was
interested in science and mathematics.
>> Were your parents
engineers or technical folks?
>> No one in my
family were technologists.
It was just something I was attracted
to and I was reasonably good at.
And so, I went down that path.
>> Where did you -- I'm just
sort of curious, where did you even find
knowledge back then
about how to program?
Did you have mentors?
Were there people helping you?
Were you able to find
books in libraries?
>> I mostly found books in
libraries and then when I got access when I
was in high school, I got access to
the local university's 1620 machine.
I got to speak and spend some
time with some of the people
actually doing programming.
And so,
they acted as mentors to help me.
>> Yeah, I'm, it's -- one of the
things that I think is easy for all of us
to take for granted now is how not just
sophisticated our programming systems are
and how much power is at the disposal of
your average programmer, but how much of
the information about how to learn how
to do software development, how much of
computer science is all out on
the Internet publicly available.
There are, like, all sorts of useful videos
explaining it from sort of elementary like
super high-level, you know, sort of
perspectives all the way down to, like, the
deep nitty-gritty research.
>> No, I agree.
I think the other thing that's changed
over the years is access to computing
equipment. When I first got access with
the first two or three machines, they were
machines that, you know, today would
have cost the equivalent of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
And they weren't machines that
were in every elementary school,
every high school, every home.
And so, there's just -- your exposure and
availability to compute -- both learning
materials, but also just the
mechanical machinery, the actual
computing devices is much easier.
Although one thing I have noticed over the
years, having been a leader in different
groups over the years, I think the
knowledge of the actual computing devices
has gotten weaker and weaker.
And it's been interesting in the last few
years as people have become interested in
machine learning and high-performance
computing again, people are rediscovering
all the nitty-gritties of limited memory
cache lines -- a lot of the very low-level
stuff that I think the early developers,
for instance, the people who created Unix
thought about how do you fit lots of
capability into a very small footprint?
>> Yeah.
>> Both memory-wise
and computing-wise, and we've
lost a lot of that.
And we're rediscovering it.
>> Yeah, and like one of the
things that I've always noticed is you know
we operate on all of these high-level
abstractions to do our jobs.
And the engineers that I've found who are
sometimes able to do the most extraordinary
things are ones who sort of disrespect --
or are able to disrespect the abstraction
boundaries, where they can sort of
say, okay, this is not working, I don't
understand what's going on, I'm not
getting the performance I want out of this.
Like, there's some weird bug and
they just sort of punch through
to lower and lower layers.
So one -- like, one of my theories about
Jeff Dean, like, he was a compiler guy,
right, by his PhD work.
And compiler folks they're very good
at just getting this end-to-end view of
computer systems and like being able to
wring extraordinary performance out of
things even though, like,
they're not actually writing the optimizer
bits of the compiler anymore.
>> No,
I completely agree with that.
Having worked with Jeff and his colleague,
Sanjay, they both I think were willing to
go very deep into the
technology and bypass layers.
And some of the people I've known for
years, I've worked with before like
Ken Thompson were definitely
of that ilk as well.
I think one of the things that modern
software suffers from is I think people
sometimes do not spend enough time thinking
about what the right abstractions are and
how to make them very simple.
I think one of the things I've admired
about Unix, which you can see in Linux
today, is a lot of the very low-level
system calls that were introduced in Unix
have stood the test of now multiple decades
because they were very thoughtful about
what should be here and what shouldn't,
and they didn't add a lot of complexity or
cross-functional capabilities.
They were all pretty
clear interfaces.
It's something a lot of modern
software designers don't take the
time and thought to do it right.
>> And how much of that do you
think were the individuals and their tastes
and how much of it was just the
constraints they were operating under?
I mean, like obviously, like a lot of
people at the time were operating under the
same constraints and not
all of them invented Unix.
But the constraints have
to be useful, right?
>> The constraints are useful,
but it is true that we live in a much more
complicated world now.
I think in the period where some of these
early time-sharing systems were built and a
lot of the mini-computer work that then led
to the personal computer work, you know,
people had glass teletypes, they were
24-by-80 character fixed-width kind of
devices for output, very simple
input, and now everybody expects a
lot of graphics, a lot of visuals.
I think just the human-computer interface
stuff that we do is much more complicated.
You're right, I think the best systems
designers know how to think about
simplicity and scalability,
but our world has continued to
get more complicated, so --
>> Yeah, it's like one of the
most interesting tensions I think we have
in modern software engineering.
>> I agree with that.
>> So, you get access to this
machine at a local university, like you
continue to get better
and better programming.
You go to college,
you major in computer science?
>> Well, I think like many
entering freshmen at Caltech, at least in
those days,
I wanted to be a physicist.
I think probably about 90 percent
of the incoming class at that
time wanted to be physicists.
>> And was
Feynman there at the time?
>>
Feynman was there.
>> Okay,
so that's a good motivator.
>> Yeah.
And I had the opportunity to meet
with him a few times in the years
I was there, an amazing person.
Although, his books are much
easier to read than it is to take
the exams associated with them.
(Laughter.) But that's -- but I think
like many of the entering freshmen
I discovered I wasn't smart
enough to be a physicist.
So, that got me into math.
My first published paper in a refereed
journal was actually when I was a freshman
-- it was a computational chemistry
paper that I did with a post-doc
and one of the faculty members.
And I had the opportunity to do things like
that during the four years I was there.
>> Do you remember
what the paper was about?
>> (Laughter.) There's an
approximation to a quantum chemistry
problem that's called a Hartree-Fock
equations, and so this was a simulation on,
at that time, a very large IBM 370
or 360-something-or-other that we ran
overnight and calculated a bunch of ground
states of different small molecules.
>> That's super cool.
>> A long time ago.
>> No, but super cool.
You know, and again, like,
we'll get back to this later.
You already mentioned that you know like
we have this sort of resurgence in like all
of the things that like people were
interested in in high-performance computing
back in the like '70s, '80s, and '90s
with all of the like large-scale machine
learning stuff that
we're doing right now.
But you know, I think that the things that
you were doing back then are probably like
largely transferrable to like
things that people are doing now
to train machine learning models.
>> Yeah,
it's interesting.
When I went to Stanford, my primary work
as a graduate student was in numerical
modeling. My thesis was on numerical
techniques for partial differential
equations, fluid flow,
and things like that.
Did a lot of work with
linear algebra and so forth.
But it was all early
high-performance computing work.
And in those days, you know, there were
controlled data machines around and
Cray-1 was starting to appear and so forth.
And so, there was a lot of interest in
different ways to do abstractions in early
high-performance computing work.
And it's interesting.
All that linear algebra, things that I got
familiar with then have been rediscovered,
of course, as part of the machine learning
revolution that we're having today.
>> Yeah, I mean, it's really,
really fascinating like as I spent a bunch
of my time trying to figure out like what
the infrastructure needs to look like to
support training very
large-scale models.
I, in a very small way, had been doing
work when I was in grad school in
high-performance computing.
And it's just remarkable to me.
Like, I thought, you know, funny enough
when I took my job at Google in 2003 that
all of the stuff that I'd done in graduate
school was like gone forever and like I
would never -- I'd never see the
day where it was useful again.
And then I'm, you know, sitting here
in 2019, and surprise, surprise.
Relevant.
(Laughter.)
>> No, it's true.
And, of course, high-performance computing
developed hybrid machines,
NUMA architectures, all kinds of things
that are reappearing now in the
machine learning context, so --
>> Yeah, well, you know,
it's sort of interesting, right?
And I'd love to get
your take on this.
We're at this moment now where there are
certain flavors of machine learning, so
this simulation-based reinforcement
learning stuff that has achieved some
fairly spectacular results that have been
publicly disclosed over the past few years,
like mostly in game playing, and then
there's like recent stuff and
natural language processing on
unsupervised learning.
And in both of these cases, like the
workloads are just because you have gotten
human supervision out of the direct
training loop, like you don't have to
produce a bunch of label training data,
like you're sort of -- reinforcement
learning, you're gathering all of your data
to train the model inside of a simulation
environment, and the unsupervised learning,
like, you just have like a large, like,
Internet corpus of data that you're
training on and you're trying to like
induce some structure out of it.
So, they're like absolutely insatiable
in terms of their compute appetite.
I mean, it's just mind boggling and like at
least with the unsupervised models, and I
think the same thing is true with these
reinforcement learning models, the more
compute that you can throw at them,
like the better the result you get.
And so, like there's just this
real tangible incentive to
like throw them more compute.
And it's happening at exactly the same time
where Moore's Law is running out of steam.
And it's not Moore's Law that's the
problem, it's sort of the Dennard scaling
that's the problem.
Like, we can put, you know, tens of
billions of transistors on a die now, we
just can't power them all.
>> Correct.
>> And so like you've -- like,
we really are having to like revisit
computer architecture and, you know,
like, how do you cool these things?
How do you design
their networks?
Like,
what is the memory hierarchy?
I mean, it's just crazy that
all of this is relevant again.
>> No, I agree.
And we're having, obviously, a revolution
again in computer architecture for all the
reasons you point out.
And you know, John Hennessy and Patterson
just won the Turing Award for basically
having thought about computer architectures
in different ways, done RISC written
their book, and kind of I think they
reopened the door as part of their Turing
Award speech and some of the speeches
they've given since, suggesting it's time
to rethink computer
architecture.
So --
>> Yeah,
I completely agree with them.
>> The other thing that's been
interesting with the insatiable appetite
for computing, and it worries me a little
bit, I still believe that universities are
the best training ground for
people doing computer science work.
You know, maybe not everybody should take
the time to go get a PhD, but I think
having a rigorous program with lots of
mathematics and theory and so forth and not
just -- it's more than just programming,
but I think one of the challenges with the
rise this time of machine
learning is I think the
universities are at a disadvantage.
>> Yes.
>> Because, you know, the big
platform companies which of course would
include Microsoft, Facebook, Google,
Amazon, and others, are the best place to
get your hands on lots of data
and lots of computing resources.
I think it's very hard for MIT or
Caltech or you know Stanford to
compete with those capabilities.
And so, I think it does call into question
what's the right partnership between
universities and
these large companies?
Because I think otherwise we're going to
have a lot of people who are deficient in
their training as they enter the
workforce and try to do novel things.
>> I completely agree.
And it's become especially obvious I think
over the past year where some of this stuff
on like the very frontier of AI, like the
computations have become so large and it's
so expensive that we even sort of have to
think carefully about it inside of like
these big tech companies.
Like, you just can't have 5,000 people all
like doing each a $10-million computation
to train their model.
Like, you have to sort of think about like
how you want to focus these efforts in ways
where you can, you know,
where you can get leverage out of
your compute infrastructure.
And I think it's especially
hard for these universities.
I've joined the advisory board of the
Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute.
And thinking in general about like how we
can form these partnerships where we can
make resources available.
I think it's beyond just
training, though.
You also really need you know sort of
dispassionate third parties, you know
pushing in interesting
new directions.
Like, one of the things I really worry
about with the state that we're in in
machine learning right now is that we have
made a bunch of subjective decisions about
how these computations should
be performed by virtue of the
frameworks that we've built.
And so like it's sort of like
MapReduce, right, back in the day.
So, as soon as you have MapReduce, it's
like such a powerful abstraction mechanism
that it solves like a ton of different
problems and like abstracts away like all
of this tedium from you know like how to
you know massively you know in distribution
fashion run these workloads.
And, you know, the tool is simple enough
and powerful enough where all of a sudden
like everybody wants to try to
bend their computation around
where it's like a MapReduce job.
And I think we have a little
bit of that right now.
I mean, so like you look at these deep
learning algorithms, like, whether it's
TensorFlow or PyTorch or like the
numerical kernel of all of these things is
stochastic gradient descent.
And, like, because you've chosen SGD as
the way that you're going to like do the
fitting for the models,
it just sort of excludes a whole bunch of
things that you might want to do.
And so, like we're -- in a real sense, we
have been pushing people down to this like
what has to be a local
-- like a local optima.
And you know, I would love to have like
just a much, much larger pool of people
sort of pushing at
those assumptions.
But in order to do it and to compete to
show that the new thing is as effective as
the, you know, the old thing, like,
they have to have the compute resources.
>> Oh, I agree.
And I think the other thing which,
of course, has happened more and more with
machine learning is not only are we
constrained by the frameworks, but we're
also I think even in the unlabeled case,
the case where you're not pre-labeling data
and you're doing unsupervised learning, I
think you have the risk that if you feed it
the wrong sets of data,
you can generate biases of various
kinds without even realizing it.
And it's tricky.
There have been a number of
published results on this stuff,
but it's kind of insidious.
>> Yes.
So, let's go back.
So, tell me a little bit more about this
experience with starting a company because
that is a very unique thing.
It is not at all like managing researchers,
it's not like -- you know, even though
Google hadn't gone public when
you got there, like it was
already a reasonably big thing.
>> Yeah,
it was 4- or 500 people.
>> But like zero to 140 is like
-- I mean, that is a -- that's something else
>> Well, you learn to
tell stories to venture capitalists.
So, now that I'm doing that as a full-time job,
you get to play the other side of that drama
But you have to think about
what's the product you want to build?
What kind of team do you need?
How much funding do you need?
You have to think
about everything.
And starting as you say from zero, you've
got the challenge of, you know, you're the
janitor when day one
starts, right?
And so, you have to think about
everything -- you'll laugh.
I did the payroll and the bookkeeping for
the first few, I think, first few months,
Not that I'm particularly good at that, but
I can do a little bit of accounting math.
>> Well, and it must have been
good preparation for what you ultimately
had to do at Google because at some point
you weren't just an engineering director of
like a group of people, you were sort of
like the CEO of like an army of engineering
people. And so, like you had HR issues,
you had finance things, you had facilities
things. I mean, like I remember walking
into your office at one point, you know,
where you were, you know,
sort of looking particularly exhausted.
And I was, like, you
know, what's going on?
And like you had this spreadsheet in front
of you like where you were thing to like
figure out where everybody was going to
sit who was being hired in the next unit of
time, which is probably very far away from
writing papers about, you know, ground
state simulations of
quantum chemistry systems.
(Laughter.)
>> No, it's true.
I, well, so I think the role I fell into at
Google was I was willing to take on stuff
that not everybody else
was willing to take on.
So, there was a small executive committee
that ran Google, of which I was a part for
a few years -- number of years.
And I -- for a while, worried a lot about
things like facilities and HR.
And you have to do this
in a young company.
You have to do what you need
to do to make it successful.
And part of the challenge and you saw this
at Google, I'm sure you also saw it in your
experience at LinkedIn, it sounds very
hard to go from zero to 140, it's also very
hard to go from a few
hundred to several thousand.
The scaling,
trying to figure out what works.
You want to introduce more process and
structure, but if you introduce too much,
it kind of kills all the energy and
excitement in the team and so forth.
And so finding a path through a heavy
growth phase of a company is pretty tricky.
And I did a lot of that for
Google in the early years.
>> What do you think was the most
challenging thing that you -- or problem
that you had to solve
in those early years?
>> I didn't join Google until
early 2003, but I think from when the
dot-com bubble burst to probably 2004 or
'05, recruiting was hard, but it wasn't
crazy like it is today because there
weren't enough kind of growing, powerful
new companies forming because of
the sort of downdraft that happened
because of the dot-com burst.
I think today, one of the challenges I see
with the young companies I work with is
just figuring out where
to recruit and what to do.
One of the things you see from more
and more companies is looking at doing
engineering away
from Silicon Valley.
>> Yeah.
>> And then I think one of the
biggest challenges I saw in the early days
at Google was it was still very much a
startup, even though when I joined it had a
few hundred employees.
And there were key areas inside the Search
product, for example, where only one or two
people actually knew some of the
key things to get things done.
And so one of the challenges that I found
particularly hard was figuring out a way to
not disempower and take responsibility away
from the people who had been standing in
the breach, so to speak, but building a
team around them so that you could actually
have turnover and have organizational
stability, but you sort of transition from
a few kind of superhero type people that
know all these key things to teams that
actually own things.
And that's an enormous cultural
change, which we went through.
I think we managed to preserve
a lot of what was good about the
original culture, but it was hard.
>> Yeah, another, I mean, just
sort of outside looking in, like one of the
things that you always seem to have a real
talent for was managing the very senior,
like, very most capable engineers and like
figuring out how to you know let -- give
them the space to do their best work
without like sort of having the crush of
like all of the sort of outside world and
you know sort of friction that can sort of
land on you as an engineer.
I mean, like, at one point, you had like
almost all of or maybe all of the principal
distinguished engineers and
fellows reporting into you.
And like they're not an easy
group of folks to manage.
I mean, I know many of
them, I love them.
Like, they're like
fantastic human beings.
But they're smart, they're -- they have
strong opinions, they're you know sometimes
their interactions you know with one
another or like with other engineers are
sort of like interesting.
But somehow or another, like, you built
this environment where all of these folks
could like really flourish because at some
point, like, they just don't -- they don't
have to work for you, they don't
have to work at Google, they can
do anything that they want to do.
>> So, I think what I tried
to do, and I think I was successful more
often than I wasn't, was find areas
that were important to the company that
different individuals
were interested in.
That's how we -- you know, we spawned
a project called Borg internally to do
cluster management. There were a group of
people -- if you look at the work that was
done there, it was very good, it was
very deep, it was ahead of its time.
But it also was rediscovering mainframe
timesharing, but on a cluster.
And so some of it was recycling ideas that
were prevalent in the '60s and in the early
'70s, but finding the right set of people
that were interested in that problem, were
motivated by the problem,
and putting them together.
So, finding things that were interesting,
you know, we had the challenge of managing
locking and global namespace stuff,
and that was an area that Mike Burrows was
particularly attracted to
and did a terrific job with.
And I think so it was
just picking individuals.
But it didn't always work.
>> That particular one is sort
of genius like sort of saying like here's
this person who can work on these
problems and like we're going to go build
infrastructure that
everybody else can use.
I mean, those are some of the hardest
problems in software engineering.
Like, proving that you know,
Paxos is implemented correctly in like
one of these locking systems.
And like Mike is, you know, maybe the best
person in the world, like, one of the best
persons in the world.
>> No, I agree.
And Google had -- and still has people
that are absolutely world class and strong.
But you're right,
some of them don't mix well together.
You have to figure out the right
problems, and it didn't always work.
The other thing I often tell young
companies that I work with now is Google
also could cheat. And I don't mean that
in a nefarious way, with the advent of
AdWords, it started to become you know lots
of positive cash flow--it gave flexibility
-- the fact that the business was so
strong gave us access to resources and
capabilities we
wouldn't have had.
And one of the things I always find amusing
is when I am working with a very young
company and they want to talk
about creating 20-percent time.
And I often will tell them when you have
a massively profitable business, why don't
you come back and ask me
about 20-percent time.
So, I think people need to
be more realistic about what
constraints you're operating under.
And at Google, one of the things I did is
like we started storage projects we weren't
absolutely sure we would need because
we had the flexibility and at another
company you wouldn't do that.
Most of those bets turned out to
be good bets, but not all of them.
>> Yeah, well, you know, it's
sort of interesting, like even 20-percent
time, like there are things like that that
take on these mythological proportions.
And, like, I don't ever
remember using 20-percent time.
And it wasn't because I didn't think it
was available, it wasn't because my manager
wouldn't have supported it, it was because
I was so interested in the work that was my
100-percent time that I didn't want to
stop doing that to go do this other thing.
I mean, it was nice to know that I had it
if I wanted to use it, but I think a whole
lot of people like --
>> Most
people did not use it.
>> Yeah.
And not everybody had an
exciting new project they wanted
to start on their own, so --
>> The thing that I really
enjoyed out of Google as it was growing as
fast as it was, so I was there like I
joined I guess a few months after you did
in 2003 and then I left the
first time in the middle of 2007.
And, you know, the thing that was just
extraordinary for me over that period of
time is like because we were growing so
fast and we were solving so many problems
for ourselves the first time, you got to be
this sort of participant in the unfolding
of like this really interesting
great business and this really
interesting great technology stack.
And you sort of got to see, okay,
this worked, this didn't work.
And like in a very quick period of time,
like I felt like I got exposed to like a
whole bunch of things that I never would
have been able to get exposure to if I had
been at some place that
wasn't growing that fast.
>> Oh,
I think that's right.
>> Like, when I left to go do
AdMob, which was already a company I joined
in 2007 to run the engineering
team when it was like -- the whole
company was about 25 people I think.
And like I felt just because I'd been able
to raise my hand and say, oh, yeah, like
I'll go help with the
mentorship program.
I'll go help set up
a faculty summit.
I will go like you need someone to go due
diligence on like an M&A thing that we're
doing. Like, none of which I was qualified
to do when I raised my hand, but because
no one else was there who was
raising their hand to do it, like
I got all of this experience.
And when I went to AdMob, it was like,
okay, like, I'm like there's still a whole
bunch of stuff I need to learn, but at
least I'm confident in like a big enough
set of things where I can, you know, I can
have some modicum of comfort that I'm not
going to screw everything up.
(Laughter.)
>> Yeah,
you can learn a lot.
And you get a lot of advancement
and opportunities to do
different things, right?
It's a special time in
many companies, so –
>> So,
you were at Google for how long?
You left in 2011?
So you were there for --
>> Eight and a
half years I think, yeah.
>> And so how -- what
was the biggest team that you had?
So, you were up to
5-, 6,000 people?
>> Yeah, it was probably
a little bit north of 6,000.
Google broke itself up into product
divisions, they call product areas.
And I think at one point,
I had amassed what are today four or
five of their product areas.
So, let's talk about the
transition to venture capital.
So, you've been doing this for
I guess almost eight years now.
>> Close
to eight years.
>> And so like what
made you could have done anything.
You could have stayed at Google, you could
have like gone to another company and done
a similar thing,
you could have started a company.
You could have retired.
You could have
basically done whatever.
>> Yeah, I think when I look
back at my career, so I thought -- one of
the challenges of the role that I had at
Google is I was unsure what I could do at
another company that wouldn't
feel like a step down.
And it's not that I'm in love with a
particular title or a particular role, but
there aren't a lot of Googles
in the growth phase out there.
I think there are probably a small number,
but they're very few and far between.
And so,
I didn't see how to repeat that.
And I think one of the things I've gotten
better at over the last ten or 15 years is
mentoring and spending time with people and
helping them think through their problems
and their challenges
and so forth.
And it felt like I could do that as a board
member, as a mentor to a bunch of young
companies. And so for me, some of it's
what people I think call "giving back," but
some of it is I think at this
stage of my career I'm probably
better as a coach than as a player.
>> Yeah, well, I mean, I remember
some of the best advice that I've ever
received has been from you.
And I remember like just vividly this one
like sort of critical moment in my own
career. So, this is when I was thinking
about leaving Google to go to AdMob, I'd
chatted with a few companies, like I had
chatted with Omar, who's I guess now one of
your partners at Sequoia,
who was like the founder and CEO of AdMob.
And I remember I asked you for a meeting,
which you were always generous enough to
take when you were much,
much busier than I was.
And I remember coming into the room and I
was like very reluctantly admitting that
it's like, oh, I've been out talking to
these companies and like I'm thinking about
leaving and you already knew
because somebody had -- whose name
I will not name had -- (laughter)
>> Yes,
I think I know who, yes.
>> And, you know, like done
a background check, I'm guessing.
But you gave me
the best advice .
You were like, okay, like, here's the
advice I'm going to give you with my Google
hat on, which is you
know, whatever that was.
And then here's, you know, the advice I'm
going to give you without the Google hat
on, which was like just super helpful to
have both of those perspectives in making
that decision,
which was really hard.
Like I had a hard time leaving because it
was really -- it was a great company and I
had so many friends there and I felt so
grateful for the opportunity that I had
gotten, which I think
a lot of it was luck.
There's no way that --
>> There's a lot of luck
in many outcomes in life, I've decided.
(Laughter.)
>> There's
a lot of luck.
Just extraordinary
amounts of it.
But, you know, like that advice you gave
me was like one of the -- and it was
certainly like a pivotal moment, like the
whole -- my experience with AdMob, like
without that, I wouldn't have been able
to you know get the role that I had at
LinkedIn. Without the role at LinkedIn,
I wouldn't be sitting here as CTO of
Microsoft. And so, you know, like in -- so,
you know, I'm glad that you're out there
like giving other people
this like really good advice.
So like, what made you decide that like
this is the sort of thing that's worth your
time? Because you were doing it even before
it was like officially your job as a like
a venture capitalist.
You didn't have to take that meeting that
day or like any of the other times, you
know, because I was way
below you in the org.
And you weren't just doing it for me, you
were doing it for a bunch of other people.
>> So, maybe this is one of
the things I've tried to do as a leader, I
think most people -- you know, when you're
employed by a company, you're employed by
Google, now I'm employed by Sequoia
Capital, you have to have loyalty to your
employer, but I also think as a leader
inside of any organization, you also have
to be authentic. And you have to -- if
somebody asks you for advice, they don't
want the company line.
They want real advice.
And so what I've always done in the last
many years is I will give you my advice as
a leader inside a company, but then I will
also give you my advice as an individual.
And I think, to me, that's been one of the
things that I think has bonded people to me
over the years, because they feel like
they're not getting a bunch of political
mumbo-jumbo, which unfortunately I think
particularly folks in large corporations,
I've known a number, they can only
talk in the sort of party line
mode and they never get out of it.
And it makes them appear,
even if it's not true, as phony.
And so I think part of it's
just being genuine and
authentic when you talk to people.
>> It's sort of scary to do
because when I was running engineering and
operations and LinkedIn, which grew over
the course of the six years that I was
doing the job from a couple
hundred people to about 3,000.
Like I took this queue from you that I was
going to try to be as authentic as possible
when someone came to me and like they were
struggling with a problem and like trying
to figure out like what
the next step was for them.
And like I would do almost exactly
the same thing that you did for me.
Like if they were contemplating a job
offer, it's like here are all the many
reasons why I would like you to stay like
because we really need you here and, you
know, like we walk
through the whole thing.
And then I would give them, you know, my
unsolicited advice, and sometimes it would
be like, hey, I don't think that this is
like based on what I know about you and
what you've told me about your
aspirations, like I don't think
that this is a good move for you.
And sometimes I would tell people,
it's like this isn't a bad option.
Like, you are now faced with a tough
choice, like I think it's a -- you know,
you've got a good option here and
you've got a good option there.
And the thing that I found, though, like
even it's a horrifying thing like when you
are leading you know a group of people
and like you and in a very sort of very
concrete way are dependent on them to like
be able to achieve all of the things that,
you know, you're trying to
get your company to achieve.
But I found like having those conversations
like I think because people believe that I
had a genuine interest in like their
success and their happiness, like I wound
up being able to hold onto a
bunch of people like way longer
than I would have otherwise.
>> I
think that's right.
>> But it was hard to
do because it feels very scary.
>> Yeah, it's risky.
It feels risky. I understand
I think the other thing which I saw at
Google and I suspect you've seen in your
arc, too, is Google hired a lot of very
bright kind of new grads or it was their
first or second job, and it was fairly
common for people after a few years to kind
of wonder what the world looked like
outside of the particular confines of
Mountain View at the time.
And that's not irrational
for a young person.
>> No.
>> And on the other hand,
Google wanted to retain those people.
And there were some
difficult challenges in that.
>> So, what's -- what are the
most interesting things that you're seeing
in venture now?
So, like, it's -- it is an exciting time
right now because like, there's a lot of
venture capital out there.
It's never been easier to start a
technology company because you have open
source, you have all this cloud
infrastructure, you have like an
increasingly powerful set of capabilities
that let small teams accomplish big things.
And like you're at Sequoia, which is like
one of the top venture capital firms in the
world. So, like,
what's interesting right now?
>> Well, there's clearly a
lot of interest in software around machine
learning. I think that there's a bunch of
companies trying to create tooling or do
vertical applications.
I think there aren't very many companies
proposing to do platforms because you've
got TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other things
in the market from companies that have,
obviously, much larger resources
than you can mount from a startup.
But the sort of machine learning software
and getting machine learning that's usable
and digestible by a broad
community is very hard to do.
And I think there are some interesting
ideas and companies around that.
There's a lot of interest in processor
technology both for machine learning, but
also I'm starting to see some companies
that are talking about rethinking more
server processors more
generally and so forth.
And so,
I think there's a lot of that.
Those are harder companies I think for
venture capital just because it requires
hundreds and millions of dollars of
investment rather than you know tens of
millions of dollars
of investment.
So, I think -- but I see
interest in that area.
There's a lot of interest in quantum
computing, which is -- you know, people
will debate whether it's about to go
commercial or whether it's still going to
be research for
a few more years.
It feels to me like we're on the cusp of
a bunch of things right now in that area.
Those are very interesting.
And then there are interesting companies in
storage and networking and so forth, but I
think the big things have been processors,
machine learning, and then quantum are
areas that I think are
particularly interesting.
>> And the processor trend, aside
from the machine learning stuff, so like
we're seeing with distributed systems,
right now that like architecturally, like
one way to compose these things now is
streams and stream processors, which are
going to have different
compute requirements than
normal sorts of processors.
There's also like this interesting thing
where you sort of reach your sort of power
saturation point with
transistors for logic, but you
haven't yet for memory cells.
>> Yeah, I think there's
tradeoffs now that people are rethinking
about -- between you know actual logic-type
processing versus memory, what kind of
embedded memory do you want, what kind
of memory structures, you know, there's
obviously new kinds of memory coming
into the market that don't require DRAM
refreshes, but are faster, that's
another area that may be interesting.
I think the other thing which strikes me
as a big challenge as people think about
processors themselves is you know, there's
been some fascinating work on the security
side and very scary, people did not think
through all the risks with speculative
execution. And on the other hand, if you
throw speculative execution out, you hurt
performance a lot.
And so I think there are people trying
to think about how do you think more from
first principles about what the security
risks are in processor design so that --
because when you admit security weaknesses
at the very bottom layer of the hardware,
it's pretty hard
to defend against.
>> Yeah.
>> And it's
scary in new ways, right?
And so, I think there are a lot
of interesting things happening
in and around that area.
>> Yeah.
Are you seeing the stuff
with the -- in the IoT space?
Because processors there like still have
a couple of generations of, you know, real
Moore's Law left in them.
>> So, we're seeing a bunch
of companies around -- there are a lot of
people looking at processors for the edge
where they can do some inference, maybe a
little bit of training I think, and very
low-cost kind of microcontroller-level
designs and so forth.
There's a number of interesting new
ideas and companies in that area.
I'm -- when I've looked at IoT, I've mostly
looked at things related to industrial IoT
because I think consumer IoT has
been tricky for a variety of reasons.
One is, it's often driven by brand and
consumer reach, which I think advantages
companies like Apple and others.
And I think the other thing is smart phones
are too good at doing a lot of different
things, and so the killer apps for the
consumer IoT I think has been pretty
limited so far.
Personal opinion, but there you go.
>> Yeah, I mean, we can certainly
see that the industrial IoT stuff, like
the applications there are like rich
and like there's an enormous amount of
opportunity there.
I think we sort of see
the world in similar ways.
>> Yeah, no it's -- consumer
IoT I think more and more devices are
connected and have some ability to
respond to command and so forth.
And we'll see a proliferation of that,
but special use cases I think are -- there
aren't enough
interesting use cases.
I talked to people that have Alexa devices
or you know the Google Home devices and so
forth and they use them to set alarms and
timers and play certain kinds of music and
so forth, and then they rapidly seem to
run out of other things do with them.
>> The thing that I think is a
little bit interesting, though, is that the
capability in these devices already like in
both the hardware and the software is much
higher than what
we're using it for.
>> Absolutely.
(Laughter.)
>> So, you know, like just as a
proof of concept thing, I'm building an AI
coffee machine right now, which probably
sounds weirder than it actually is.
But like the idea is, can you build a
consumer appliance from scratch, like as an
individual, although like you know,
one with slightly more resources than an
average individual.
But, like, can you build a device that has
like a modern AI-powered user experience in
it? And so, like this thing will
have no buttons, no displays.
And it will have a camera,
a speaker, and a microphone.
And so like when you walk up to it and like
it knows that you're paying attention to
it using very straightforward computer
vision models, it will say to you, "Can I
make you a cup of coffee?" And it will be
able to recognize who you are and remember
your preferences and --
>> Yeah,
no, that's true.
>> And, like, that's an entirely
-- you know, entirely doable mode of like
building a user interface on a consumer
device right now and it's going to be not
too terribly expensive in
the not-too-distant future.
Like, I'm going to be able to do this with
30 bucks' worth of electronics and like the
price of that's going down to two over
the next few years, I would imagine.
>> I think you'll see that in
a lot of consumer devices, but they'll be
very limited and
narrow use cases.
>> Yeah.
I just -- I'm just super excited about
(laughter) about what's possible there, so
I want to get people
inspired to do more.
>> I think human interfaces
that are voice driven and have some aspect
of computer vision is clearly
where things are going.
>> Yeah, awesome.
Well, thank you so much for taking
the time to talk with us today, Bill.
It's been a pleasure.
>> It's been
my pleasure to be here.
Thank you for again
for the invitation.
>> Awesome.
***[MUSIC]***
>> Well, we hope you enjoyed
Kevin's interview with Bill Coughran.
So, Kevin, one of the really interesting
things that you and Bill were talking about
is what was old is kind of new again,
and kind of how the tech that was -- the
problems that we were trying to solve in
the '70s and '80s and even the '90s are now
kind of coming back
in vogue again.
Why do you think that it is that those
problems are so relevant and that we're
still going back and kind of
revisiting some of those ideas?
>> Yeah, it's amazing to me
how cyclical technology is as a business.
Like I've been coding since I'm 12, I'm
47 now, so, you know, 35 years-ish of like
paying very close attention to
what's happening in computing.
And like just inside of like the 35 years
like there have been multiple cycles where
you'll like have this intense enthusiasm
for a thing and then it will sort of fall a
bit out of fashion, and then the next
thing comes in and you'll sort of forget
temporarily all
about the old stuff.
You know, I think these older technologies
that pop back up, it's almost a puzzle why
they went out of fashion
in the first place.
You know, it's like you look high
performance computing for instance, we were
building in the '70s, '80s, and '90s
like these very sort of idiosyncratic
supercomputers and very high
performance machines that all
were different in little ways.
So, like they had a good idea about how do
the memory hierarchy or a good idea about
how to do networking or a good idea about
how to split the computation up across a
bunch of different processors.
And the thing that caused them to go out
of fashion is like there was this sort of
catalyst, you know, driven by the
rapid growth of the Internet to sort of
standardize your compute architectures on
commodity CPUs, commodity memory, commodity
networks,
like commodity everything.
And so, like you just sort of created at
massive scale like large, large amounts of
compute where all of the like individual
units of compute looked exactly the same
and were built as
cheaply as possible.
And like that works really well for, you
know, sort of the problems that we had for
the first 20 years or so of like the
commercial explosion of the Internet.
What we're seeing right now is like the
problems are different again, but like
different in the same way that they
were like a bunch of years ago.
And so, like now we are -- we're digging
back up all of that good work that folks
did a few decades ago and are
realizing like how valuable it
still is in these new contexts.
It's really fun, because I spent a bunch
of the early parts of my career thinking
about these things.
Like I did an internship at the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications like
where we like when I was there we had just
taken delivery of this machine called the
CM5 from a company called Thinking
Machines, founded by, you know, a famous
computer scientist, Danny Hillis,
who like I hope we will get to
come on this show at some point.
Like Danny is like a super awesome human
being and like just like maybe the most
brilliant mad scientist
I've ever met.
I love Danny.
But anyway, you know, this machine was just
epically big and like epically cool and
just sort of like it was -- it was a
challenge to program this thing, but like
when you could harness all of its
power, it could do miraculous things.
And, you know, I never in my life would
have thought that all of this stuff that I
did back in the '90s was going
to be relevant again one day.
So, it's like really I'm sort of glad that
technology has these cycles, because it's
almost like I get to do two things at once,
sort of be nostalgic about like all of
this cool old stuff and like I get a set of
techniques to solve a set of problems that
are very relevant today.
>> I love it.
No, it's so cool to be able to revisit the
past but also use the advantages that we
have now in solving
those problems.
That's great.
>> And the -- the cycles
are -- like can be really long.
Like the other thing, too, like I think is
worth thinking about AI right now and some
of the disruptive effects that it could
potentially have, like we're learning
lessons even from the Industrial
Revolution, which is like not just a couple
of decades ago,
it's like centuries ago.
>> No, that's so true,
I hadn't even thought about, but you're
right, I mean, these cycles can be really
long and we can learn lessons from them --
or hopefully we can, right?
>> Yeah.
So, the -- the message for the
young ones is like pay attention
to history, very, very important.
>> Okay, so we need to wrap
up, but before we do, remember to tell
your friends, your colleagues, your
neighbors, your barista, your Lyft driver,
your dental hygienist -- real talk, I
actually have told my dental hygienist and
my dentist, I have.
Okay, you know, you get it, tell everybody
you know about the show and you can write
to us anytime at
BehindTheTech@microsoft.com, to give
us your feedback and tell us
what you'd like to hear more of.
>> Yeah,
we really would like to hear from you.
See you next time.

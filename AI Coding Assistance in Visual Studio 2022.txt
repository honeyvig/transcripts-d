a big step forward for the AI engine
here in Visual Studio 22. here's a just
a very simple.net console app and I want
to show you some cool things and
improvements we've done to the AI based
coding assistant so I'm going to type a
new line here and notice how Visual
Studio automatically will suggest that I
put in a last name which is exactly what
I want in this case I want the last name
property to be inserted for me right
here I also want the full name so let's
hit enter again and this time it
suggests age which is it could be the
accurate one but I want full name so I'm
just gonna pretend it's not showing me
anything and just start typing public
string full name and notice here I can
just hit Tab and I get my full name and
it understands that full name is a
product of first name and last name so
the AI engine here in Visual Studio
understands the context I'm in
absolutely fantastic here let's scroll
down and you can see here I have a
method here called remove data and all
it does it removes some data from the
list that I have defined above it what's
missing here is is a method for adding
data so again I'm going to hit enter
and visual studio already knows what I'm
going to do here I'm going to create an
add data method so notice that based on
the name remove data it understands what
remove means and so it suggests that I
created a method called add but what was
crazy was that it knew what that would
do inside the method so it knew that it
it should not take the list and remove
something it should add to that list
this is just absolutely fantastic here
I'm just coding by tapping enter and hit
hitting the Tab Key here and we can take
it a step further let's say that I want
to create a new method or I want some
code but I'm not entirely sure how I
should write it what I can do is that I
can express it in a code comment like
this one so here I have a comment it
says take the two arguments and add them
together so the arcs
refers to the arcs that come into the to
the main method up here so I'm just
writing here in plain English what it is
that I would like to have happen I can
hit enter and visual studio will
automatically suggest what that code
might look like it understands what I'm
saying in English in the code comment
and can translate that into something
that might be what I want this is the AI
engine that is built upon huge data set
and using machine learning it's able to
take the context that the AI engine is
aware of and pair that up with the big
machine learning model when we pair
those up together Visual Studio can do
amazing things like this

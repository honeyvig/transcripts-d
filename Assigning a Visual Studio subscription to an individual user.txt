- Assigning subscriptions is a key task
for a visual studio
subscriptions administrator.
To assign a subscription to an individual
select add, and choose
individual subscriber
from the dropdown.
In the flyout panel,
the fields to add a
subscriber are displayed.
There are two ways to continue from here.
If your organization is
using Microsoft Entra ID,
you'll have the option to search
your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.
Selecting the individual's
Microsoft Entra ID
will automatically populate their name,
sign in email,
and notification email,
if one is maintained.
Add a different notification email
for receiving communications
if you'd like.
Select the subscription level.
Choose whether the subscriber can access
software downloads and product keys.
Then select the country and language.
To make notes about a
subscription assignment,
just add some details
into the reference field.
Lastly, click add.
And you'll see the subscription
as assignments list
update with a subscription
assigned to the user.
If your organization is not
using Microsoft Entra ID,
it's just a few extra steps.
Instead of searching
in the search Microsoft Entra ID field,
type the subscriber's
name and email address.
Then follow the same steps as before.
Next, click add.
Review any notices displayed.
Then once you're ready, click confirm.
You'll see the subscription
assignments list
update with a subscription
assigned to the user.

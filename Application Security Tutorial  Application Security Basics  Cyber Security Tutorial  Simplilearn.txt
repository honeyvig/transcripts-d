security was traditionally considered an
afterthought in software development it
is becoming an increasingly important
concern for all aspects of app
development from design to deployment
and Beyond the number of programs
produced distributed deployed and
patched across Network continually
increases as a result application
security features must deal with with a
wide range of risks let's take an
example a malicious script may be
mirrored on the victim's web browser or
kept in a database and run whenever the
user contacts the proper function
depending on the kind of attack in
question here this allows malicious code
to be entered in the case of an output
the major cause of this attack is faulty
user input validation which allows
malicious input to enter the final
output an evil user can enter a script
that will be injected into the website
code the browser will then be unable to
determine whether the process code is
harmful as a result a malicious script
is performed on the victim's browser or
a bogus form is shown to the users are
you aware of which attack this is if not
do stay till the end to find the correct
answer are you aware of which attack
this is if not please stay till the end
of the video to know the correct answer
hey everyone welcome to today's video on
application security before we move
forward subscribe to our Channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
from us let's take a look at the topics
to be covered today we start by learning
about application security and its
different types we learn about the most
common vulnerabilities in appsc followed
by the importance of application
Security in today's cyber security
space next we cover some attacks against
application layer security and end the
video with some protection techniques to
enforce application security parameters
so let's start by learning about
application security from a Grassroots
perspective application security which
is often known as appet protects
application software from external
security threats by utilizing security
software Hardware methodologies best
practices and different processes
organizations require application
security technologies that Safeguard all
of their programs from internal to
popular external apps on consumer mobile
phones these Solutions must address the
whole development cycle and provide
testing after an application has been
deployed to detect possible issues
application security mechanisms must be
capable of testing web pages for
possible and exploitable vulnerabilities
analyzing code and assisting in the
administration of development and Safety
Management processes the testing
Solutions must also be simple and easy
to install for system administrators
worldwide consumers utilize hundreds of
applications Del to access theoretically
important and favored services such as
e-commerce banking music Etc to be
productive these professionals use a
variety of software Solutions as well
ranging from online word Checkers to
tablet based creative tools among other
things backend software of course exists
to automate essential operations and
processes and decreases human labor but
to make matters worse the quantity and
complexity of these apps and their
backend code is increasing the software
security problem 10 years ago was about
securing desktop apps and static web
pages that were natively harmless and
easy to scale through and
defend because of Outsource development
the number of Legacy programs and
in-house development that uses
thirdparty open source and
commercialized off the shelf software
modules the software supply chain has
become considerably more
convoluted now that we understand
application Security on a general level
let us go through some of the different
categories or the types of application
security the three major types to be
covered in this section web application
security API security and Cloud native
application
security a web application is a program
available through the internet and it
operates on a web server the client is
accessed using a web browser the
applications by definition must allow
connections from clients across
unsecured Network this exposes them to a
variety of risks many online apps are
mission critical and include sensitive
customer data making them an attractive
Target for attackers and a top concern
for any cyber security program or
framework the Advent of https which
offers an encrypted channel of
communication Gods versus man in the-
Middle attacks or mitm attacks has
addressed several online application
weaknesses many weaknesses though still
persist many security providers have
created Solutions specifically geared to
safeguard online applications in
response to the rising challenge of web
application security a web application
firewall is an example of a security
technology meant to identify and prevent
application layer sols in the case of
web
applications and it comes to apis apis
that have security flaws are the root of
many major data breaches they have the
potential to reveal sensitive data and
disrupt vital corporate processes API
security flaws include insufficient
authentication unintended data
disclosure and a failure to apply rate
restriction which allows API abuse the
requirement for API security like the
necessity for web application security
has led to the creation of sophisticated
equipment that can discover API
vulnerabilities and protect apis in
production level the third type is cloud
native application security
infrastructure and environments are
often built up automatically in Cloud
native apps depending on declarative
configuration which is known as
infrastructure as code or
IAC developers are tasked to developing
declarative settings and application
code both of which which should be
secure because practically everything is
defined during the development stage
shifting left is even more crucial in
Cloud native setups traditional testing
techniques can help Cloud native apps
but they are insufficient dedicated
Cloud native Security Solutions are
mandatory at this point of time which
are capable of instrumenting vessels
container clusters and serverless
operations reporting on security
concerns and providing developers with a
quick feedback loop now that you have
covered the different types of
application secur
let us go through some of the most
common vulnerabilities that these
Frameworks face on a daily basis first
is cryptographic failure when data is
not adequately safeguarded in transit
and at rest cryptographic failures which
are forly known as sensitive data
exposures occur it has the potential to
reveal credentials health information
credit card details and personal
information as well depending on the
type of data being protected in that
particular case injection
C actors can use injection
vulnerabilities to convey malicious
information to a web application
interpreter it has the potential to
assemble and execute this data on the
server SQL injection is a popular type
of injection which I've already covered
in an introduction for this
video another major vulnerability are
outdated components vulnerable and out
ofate components inass any vulnerability
caused by obsolete or unmaintained
software it can happen if you construct
or even use an application without first
learning about its core components and
versions authentication failures
identification and authentication
failure which are previously known as
broken authentication enpass any
security issue involving user identities
identity attacks and exploitation may be
avoided by implementing secure session
Administration authentication and
validation for all identities in the
organization in the next section let us
cover some of the protection mechanisms
employed by cyber security firms and
thirdparty automated software to prevent
the application layer from being
bombarded with SQL injections and other
attacks the first is a web application
firewall or
WF a web application firewall monitors
and filters HTTP traffic between a web
application and the worldwide web web
application firewall architecture does
not address all risks but it may be used
in conjunction with other defense mechan
mechanisms it can use to the portfolio
of Security Solutions to provide a
comprehensive defense against diverse
attack Roes it is a protocol layer 7
protection in the open systems
interconnection or the OSI model
Paradigm that helps defend online
application against attacks such as
cross-side scripting cross-side fraud
esap injection and file
infusion unlike a proxy server which
conceals the identity of client
computers by an intermediary a functions
as a reverse proy shielding the server
from exposure it acts as a barrier in
front of a web application protecting it
from the internet so clients must pass
through the web application firewall
before they can access the
application the second is threat
assessment a list of sensitive assets to
safeguard will assist you in
understanding the threat to your firm
and how to minimize them considering how
a hacker can infiltrate an application
if existing security protections are in
place and whether additional tools or
defense capability are required it's
also crucial to keep your security
expectations in check nothing is
impenetrable even if the most stringent
security measures it would be best if
you were realistic about what you
believe your team can handle in the long
run when pushed to aggressively safety
regulations and procedures might be
disregarded remember that safety is a
lengthy and time-taking project that
requires the collaboration of other
employees and sometimes even your
customers the next topic is privilege
management
limiting privileges is vital especially
for Mission critical and sensitive
systems the least privileged principle
states that access to programs and data
should be limited to those who require
them when they require them for two
reasons the least privileged principle
is absolutely
critical the first is that hackers May
compromise less privileged accounts and
ensuring they do not acquire access to
highly sensitive systems is
critical the second is that internal
ders are equally harmful as external
adversaries if insiders go bad it's
critical to ensure they never have more
power than they need minimizing the harm
that they may be able to cause to the
organization that's the end for this

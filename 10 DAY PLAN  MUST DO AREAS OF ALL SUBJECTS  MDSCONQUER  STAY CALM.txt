and all and uh I hope you're all set
okay set to give exam okay what to be
done in this 10 days I'll be discussing
now okay important things what what you
need to make a note and everything I'll
be discussing now so but you are
mentally prepared to give exam okay so I
don't want to discuss about the
consequences and all these things but uh
let's
focus uh more on giving exam and
uh revising the things what you have
listed to revise okay right so you need
to do the revision so in this 10
days so in this 10
days which which are listed in front of
you hope I'm Audible and visible to you
right screen is visible to you so in
this 10 days your atmost focus should be
on revision only revision revision
revision means revisiting the same thing
redoing the same thing what you have
done in the last one to two months
months particularly because as neat has
been extended okay so what we have done
is we have done the one more round of
revision so what you have done in that
one more round of revision you need to
recollect and you need to revise them
okay so it is revision okay and if you
ask me sir shall I learn new
things my open answer is almost no okay
my answer open answer is almost no so
your 90 to 95 percentage of your time
in the next 10 days should be on redoing
the same
things and the left over 10 to 5
percentage of time unnecessarily
something will come in front of you okay
I said this is a new classification to
be done okay last year the question was
given by no you have done 2023 you have
done all the things but not completely
accurate maybe you maybe 90 95% is
accurate suddenly you see a question
your friend is telling this is a last
last year repeat and you don't know it
you're doing it okay you don't know it
unfortunately you have not done it
unfortunately not clear with that
concept so that is also new thing okay
so that new things will be 5 to 10
percentage I hope this is very very
clear okay the things what you need to
focus in this 10 days is 90 to 95
percentage of your time or 90 to 95
percentage of your time should be on
revision 5 to 10 percentage of time you
can give for unknown things new things
which you suddenly don't intentionally
do the unknown things for example I'm
giving a good example for example an
individual is not done with pharmacology
not at all done with pharmacology okay
or an individual is not at all done with
a particular segment of pharmacology for
example a chemotherapy of pharmacology
was not done it is completely new so
don't do anything new even if it is very
very important don't do new because if
you want to do new things new things
will take more time when things are
taking more time
then you are not smart in the last 10
days it's clear right so you're not done
with a particular subject you're not
done with a particular topic okay and
you're you check your scores you're not
so confident then it is not at all
suggested to do new things by keeping
more time okay so I want you to give 90
to 95 percentage of your time for
revision and 5 to 10 percentage of your
time to learn new and unknown things
okay clear I hope this is very very
clear so this is the first thing I want
to press on so what are the what are the
primary things okay must do
things must
do in the last 10
days you have 10 days towards the exam
so must do things in the last 10 days to
get a better result the result should be
better it's not about what you have done
in the last last 10 days it is about
what is the outcome of your exam okay
last 10 days to get a better
result to get a better
confidence to get a better rank so these
are the primary goals in the last 10
days for these two for for you to attend
these things okay the first thing is you
should
focus
on more on
your
[Music]
reading you should focus more on reading
okay what I mean is don't analyze giving
a mock exam okay you give a mock exam
your score was around like 500 550
previous mock you got 600 marks okay now
don't try to analyze that by 600
previous now why 550 because the stage
of analysis the stage of analysis the
stage of rectifying the things the stage
of learning from the mistakes is over is
over it's over okay last 10 days also
you cannot analyze the each and every
question paper each and every question
that is not done okay that's not fair
okay so you should focus only on
reading reading means you should give
more importance to
content not
mcqs it doesn't mean I'm I'm not telling
you to not to do mcqs you have to do
mcqs but you have to give most of your
time on content reading synopsis reading
quick revision notes whatever you have
marked whatever you have highlighted
whatever you have underlined whatever
you are prepared to revise focus on that
not on mcqs okay the mcqs game is over
in the last two months yes you have to
do more mcqs but not in the last 10 days
in the last 10 days you should focus you
should focus on revisiting the things
which are done by you okay so the must
do thing in the last 10 days is focus on
reading focus on
revision focus on
yourself okay you don't check what your
friend is doing you don't check how many
marks your friend has got maybe some of
your friends may be giving some some
mock exams okay so or grand exams Grand
exams or mock exams suddenly they will
ping you suddenly they will call you
okay suddenly they hey I have given this
18th mock exam have you given it how
many marks you got what is the point
what is the point your marks in the
final exam are important your
performance in the final exam is
important not in 18th or 19th Grand exam
it's okay even if you're not done with
few grand exams maybe you're done with
15 out of 20 it's okay no problem be
perfect with those 15 be clear with
those 15 so I want you to focus more on
yourself I want you to focus more on
reading the content rather than doing
the mcqs I want you to focus more on
revising the content rather than
learning the things these are the must
three do things in the last 10 days guys
are you clear I want your response on
the chat box okay okay three mandatory
things is reading more reading the
synopsis more reading the notes more
reading your mcqs even if you doing
doing an McQ of your PR live or even if
you're doing an McQ of your offline
paper Okay offline paper or you're doing
an McQ read it read it don't solve it
okay because solving stage we have
already crossed there is no point of
sitting thinking solving coming out with
an answer reading expression no read it
read the mcqs okay solving we have
started we have done so reading is more
important than solving the mcqs okay
then revision is more important second
one rather than doing the new content
okay new contents sometimes it comes
learn it learn and move on and focus
only on yourself only on your
preparation what you are reading focus
on it don't compare with your friends
don't compare with your seniors don't
compare with your I mean with your mates
who are sitting with you reading with
you either in the offline Center or
you're reading together on the group no
that's that's not at all advised okay so
these are the main important things I
want you to focus three important things
I want you to focus as of now okay right
right right now the next one is okay the
next one is your final exam is beinging
splitted into two parts okay so
part A and Part B Part B is more often a
dental
questions part A is also having dental
questions part A is also having dental
questions but it's more often a medical
papers medical I mean medical
questions definitely definitely from a
general general student point of VI
general in general I'm talking
definitely part A is going to be more
tough than Part B in general but if your
reading and revisions are proper I see
students coming out and telling part A
is more easy because part A most of the
things will be on most common topics
okay for for
example if we talking about respiratory
system okay or if you're talking about
Ral system we know what are the most
important things okay nephrotic
nephritic syndrome or coming to the
respiratory system lung volumes lung
capacitance from physiology or your
oxygen dissociation curve a carbon
dioxide dissocation curve from
physiology followed by if you're talking
about medicine okay so most of your
questions will be moving around asthma
or copia or empyema or bronchial
carcinoma okay or treatments of these
things or May maybe on TB okay so these
are the common things most of your
questions in part will be on common
things very common things very common
things whereas Part B questions yes
definitely they will also move around
common things but some bouncers may come
which are important for dental student
ranking okay so bouncers will come for
example like you talk about Prosthetics
definitely you have a high chances you
have a question on Finish Lines of fbd
or you have a question on phonetics or
you have a question on major
connectors or you have a question one or
two questions on exclusively on the
steps what you do in complete denture in
at a BDS level okay right or you will
have a definitely two to three questions
moving on implant implants okay one
question may be tough but other
questions can be easy right so this is a
rough analysis okay so don't get panick
part A or Part B this to do that to do
no okay so everything is going to be
comfortable for you trust the process
trust your prepar
okay and just move ahead okay so don't
rely Morely on social media okay on the
things which get circulated which which
are which are coming as a suggestion
okay so please don't stay away from the
social media okay still there are few
students messaging me about the
postponement of exam about this and that
it is waste of time why if I ask them
why because someone is posting someone
is talking it on social media okay so my
suggestion we are at last 10 days let it
be whatever it is going to be it's a
decision of nbe okay but now as of now I
want you to focus on on on Preparation
okay right so don't generalize the
things whether to go with part A or Part
B whatever you feel comfortable at the
time of exam okay you proceed with that
don't prepare your mind before the exam
that I need to go solve this first come
out solve this next I want to solve it
in two rounds I want to solve it in
three rounds someone is telling on
YouTube who is a Topper who is a great
teacher Okay so
I'll do like this don't get prepared I
hope you're very very clear like what
what I mean okay so because most of you
guys who are working from past one year
odd few of you from six months let it be
okay and most of you have
given number of exams okay let's check
the let's check the mock folder the mock
folder is having uh 20 mock exams four
module exams you have three or four
grand examinations and you have previous
papers so you have given given lots of
examinations in this pattern of 240 mcqs
so my suggestion is then there is no
point of taking a suggestion okay if
you're if you're done with only one or
two mock exams or maybe five mock exams
then you require suggestions from the
mentor okay right but once you're done
with 20 25 30 Mark examinations there is
no point of taking suggestion from any
side whatever is comfortable for you
whatever you feel good whatever is going
to take you from the analysis of these
mock exams what you have done through
the process you just try to implement
them okay don't randomly uh predetermine
your mind before going for exam okay
someone is telling to do Part B first
then move to part a half of the part a
half of the part B half of the part a
half of the part B someone is telling
you to do in three rounds round one this
questions round two that questions round
two these questions revision again okay
no diagrams one part stop this stop this
nonsense okay let's do whatever the that
is comfortable for you whatever you feel
that is going to be good for you because
as an MDS conquer students uh exposed
to more number of examinations and
secondly our WhatsApp activity because
you have the habit of reading the things
fast reading the things fast you have
the habit of reading the things fast
which are on the screen of your phone or
laptop okay so that's an extra Advantage
so I don't um I I don't I have never
seen uh students coming out of the exam
and telling that time is not sufficient
okay time is not a big deal for conquer
students so you know don't worry so
whatever you feel comfortable you go
ahead and do it okay so that is one
important thing I want to stress on and
coming to the uh I don't want to give
any mustard topics or any checklist
because checklist topics we are
discussing from long back I hope in uh
lots of live sessions we have discussed
about the checklist what to be done how
to be done what prol live student has to
do what offline student has to do okay
everything but but I'm going to talk
about this must to do topics or must do
things let's consider as must do things
okay one important thing is one
important aspect is in the must
do if you are not clear what to be done
if you are not clear if not clear don't
feel bad it doesn't mean that your
preparation is not up to Mark okay your
preparation is up to mark but some few
of us are not cleared because few of
us we used to have a habit of just
blindly following the mentor because
it's a guided based preparation with MDS
conquer so you have a habit from the day
one of conquer you have a habit of
following the schedule or pattern or
suggestion that is given by the mentor
so there it's not a problem you okay so
good students know what to do or bad
students or people whose preparation is
not not up to Mark they don't know what
to be done okay so we don't have any
such theories so my suggestion is if you
are not clear what to be done okay if
you're not clear or if you are not
confident what to be done if you're not
confident in the preparation if you're
not clear in the preparation my
suggestion I want you to focus more on
mocks more on modules more on repeats at
least the repeats available on the
website because if you check out uh the
mock exams roughly we have 20 mock exams
each of 240 questions so that turns
around like 4,800 if I'm not great in
the calculations but okay I can manage
and next four module exams each of 240
like turns around like th000 mcqs and
you have repeats from 2018 to 2023 that
is 18 is 1 19 2
20 21
22 23 six papers 6 into 240 turns around
1,500 roughly I'm giving so five 6 7 you
have
7,000 plus mcqs only on the mock more
than that in fact like you may be having
some eight or 8,000 okay so this is the
best mode of revision okay this is the
best mode of revision if you're not
clear if you're not clear what to be
done I want I my suggestion is focus
more on these
things along with these things if you
have access to Quick revision
videos cision videos is more of like
storytelling just watch it if you see
feel like okay I'm talking about Endo
you have opened and we are talking about
Endor and you see Elise classification
I'm discussing you are familiar with El
classification skip it okay so now
you're not clear with Anderson's
classification see it menton's
classification of C can see it okay
Kim's classification of uh periapical
surgery not clear watch it okay so
whatever you're not clear not confident
watch it whatever you are clear skip it
this is the revision this is revision
doesn't mean I'm asking you to check the
quick revision means doesn't mean to
check top to bottom of the quick
revision okay I hope this this is very
clear okay so I want you to focus more
on these aspects and the second category
of students if you're clear the second
category is if you're
clear I hope you have all you have
already started the journey okay right
so I was I was telling you from from the
day one of the Year let's prepare for
the last 10 days and I know that most of
you are prepared for the last 10 days do
according to your plan okay no
suggestions from my side do according to
your plan you guys are doing good all of
you are doing good so there's no extra
suggestions from my side but my
recommendation is don't miss this okay
don't miss them not these are not must
to
do if I am a student if I am a student
I'm not talking as a mentor okay if I am
a
student if I am a student I don't want
to miss these things I will do this I
have done this during my preparation I
made all my students in the last 9 to 10
years to do the same and I made you to
do the same when you're giving in C also
okay right so I C also right so I'm uh
I'll be telling this first year subjects
General
Anatomy please do dental pulse
synopsis okay Dental pulse synopsis make
sure check
diagrams diagrams wherever required
austrology what is how do identify a
foren how do I identify muscles of
mitigation how do I identify the
branches of facial nerve okay right so
diagrams are important so then the
second
subject along with General Anatomy you
have General
histology General histology I want you
to focus on uh the examples of
epitheliums and diagrams of
epitheliums right then focus on General
embryology must do
okay fenel arches fenel
pouches development of face
pallette
tongue
lip must do must do I don't want you to
skip so this is the first subject so
we're done with the first subject make
sure you should do these things okay uh
levels of lymph node okay you see levels
of lymph nodes
make sure uh okay you you do the basic
anatomy anotomy of
liver
lung
kidney
heart
ear ey muzzles of eyeball these are
Basics okay right these are Basics okay
please try to do it so then jumping into
the second subject
okay so that is your
biochemistry by chemistry I want you to
focus on Dental pulse
synopsis
or PP book synopsis both very good
wonderful uh in this I want you to focus
more on uh
vitamins check out the vitamins daily
requirement of vitamins normally
deficien and all these things I hope you
can Manis I want you to check the
enzymes lipid
profiles all the classifications related
to the biochemistry were covered in your
PP books please try to do the memory
based questions
plus I want you to focus more
on rate limiting
enzymes okay right so jumping into
biochemistry biochemistry is not going
to eat much of your time during the
revision process so then then jumping
into the next subject is
physiology I want you to focus more on
Dental pulse
synopsis don't miss it don't miss it
that's what my suggestion is whatever
I'm telling is not must do I'm telling
not to miss them okay nothing more than
that then uh the fourth one is Dental
anotomy again Dental pul synopsis very
good
good next fifth Dental histology again
Dental pulse
synopsis plus do histology
diagrams because last year NE also they
have given histology diagram then color
plates of
wheelers particularly I want you to
focus more on permanent
dentation I want you to focus more on
permanent tion with which I'm done with
all the first year subjects then jumping
into the second year
subjects do let me know if I miss
anything I'm not prepared for this I
don't have anything in front of you I'm
telling if I am a student in this 10
days these are the things I will do okay
with my uh two years of reading
experience and 10 years of teaching
experience considering myself as a
students I don't want to miss
them then jumping into the next subject
first year sub uh second year subjects
pharmacology so I'll be splitting the
pharmacology into General pharmacology
and dental pharmacology so in Dental
pharmacology I'll be focusing on top to
bottom of laas I hope you are familiar
calculations of L and everything so
general anesthesia we may not be
familiar so please spend more time with
general anesthesia particularly stages
of
anesthesia cons station okay
particularly nitrous
oxide stages of anesthesia and all those
gases and their pecular points uh where
to be given how to be given and
everything okay then I want you to focus
more on uh uh right pin index values
color codings color of the cylinders and
all these things from GA and then I want
you to focus on chemotherapy
particularly
tetracyclin sephos sporin penins antib
drugs anti-malaria
drugs anti-cancer
drugs of course Amino Amino glycosites
and all these things everything
everything top to bottom which are very
important for Dentistry has to be then
then comes the emergency
drugs of
Dentistry medical emergencies of
Dentistry has to be done okay then the
other important topic of uh is drug
interactions drug
interactions Dental drug interactions
has to be done okay right okay so coming
to General pharmacology first chapter of
General pharmacology is important top to
bottom particularly your phases phases
of clinical trials levels of clinical
trials what are drug inducers and all
those all those things first order
kinetics second or zero order kinetics
okay all those things has to be done
thoroughly uh then uh for every system
uh you guys has to be clear about the
main classification for example like
you're talking about the renal drugs you
should be very very clear about the uh
diuretics okay you should be very very
clear about the diuretics or whenever
you're talking about git so you should
be very very clear about the proton pump
inhibitors you're talking about the
respirator system okay you should be
very very clear about anti-histamines
very important okay every year you have
you're you're encountered with a
question on that so apart from this
pharmacology drugs of choice are
important so lots of drug Choice based
questions were discussed on your
activities both in the telegram as well
as in the WhatsApp okay so those are the
best mode again in this 10 days you'll
you'll be constantly get exposed to most
of the drug of choice based questions
okay so drug of choice based
questions adverse effect based
questions okay or a particular drug in a
particular
is important for example you're talking
about tetracyclin which of the following
tetracycline can be given in the Ral
failure okay so that is a particular
condition a particular drug has to be
given so such questions also they can
ask you okay so that is about
pharmacology so then then jumping into
uh
microbiology uh I want you to stick on
to your notes as what you have prepared
particularly uh
sterilization Basics all Basics okay and
uh immunoglobulins are very important
areas hyper sensitivities are very
important areas if you're not clear then
go back and check
it for example sterilization I'm very
clear imunoglobulin I'm very clear hyper
sensitiv I'm very clear so I don't want
to revise them but these are important
you'll have one question on each of
these topics so I feel like I'm not very
clear with bacteriology so what I'm
going to do I'm going to spend some
extra time with bacteria particularly
you have a very important bacteria like
TB is important you have stepto cus
important stus important nemoc cus is
important hpy is important okay defia is
important syphilis is important okay
have syphilis is important TB is
important lepr is important so I don't
want to waste my time on unimportant
things I'll be checking all the
important things okay what is the test
to be done how to identify on a
particular agar okay uh yeah what what
are gr positive what are gram negative
what is CMP and all these things I I'll
try to have a glance because definitely
I'm not a microbiologist so there is a
high chance that I'll definitely lead to
confusion so then comes the second
important is virus virus I'll be
focusing on uh HIV markers as well as
I'll be focusing on Hepatitis B
markers a little bit of covid-19 I'll be
checking and herpa simplex virus epting
bar virus
cyto megali virus are important things
to be done okay then
fungus uh maybe I'll be focusing on
candidasis and mucom micosis maybe a
little bit of uh about each and every
other fungus and coming to parasitology
I'll be focusing on
malaria I'll be focusing on
Antica maybe tea solum little bit of
tenal solum or oia brany okay so maybe
but more often malaria and anas because
even if you check out the last 2023 you
have a question on Antica okay right so
so done jumping
into General path General path all the
basics like I hope you can handle all
those things like uh the necrosis
different types of necrosis and their
examples apoptosis anti-apoptotic genes
apopto promoting genes uh maybe a little
bit about your complement system okay I
hope you are very familiar with those
things uh or like you talk about gangin
different types of gangin and their
examples different types of
calcifications what is difference
between metastatic and dystophic
calcification
thrombi inflammation steps in
inflammation St steps in edema formation
and all these things are very raw Basics
maybe memory based aspect I want you to
focus on
genetics so genetics you need to spend
some time what are the uh I mean
syndromes or what are the conditions
autosomal recessive autosomal dominant
xlink recessive all these things
examples are very very important and I
want you to check out the pedigree
charts so how to solve a pedigree chart
is again an important area that the
questions can come from okay then
jumping into the next subject is DM DM I
want you to focus on Dental pulse
synopsis enough okay with a little bit
of repeats is more than sufficient okay
right so then jumping into uh the third
year subjects general medicine general
medicine you don't have a proper
background so that is the reason why I
want you to do if you if you have time I
want you to focus
on uh doing the main things main
diseases main diseases or main things in
each
system general surgery I want you to
focus more on thyroid carcinomas more on
thyroid what is hypothyroid
what is hyper thyroid different types of
thyroid abnormalities what is thyroid
stro and all these things what are the
drugs of choice and everything I want
you to focus on ulcers I want you to
focus on
burns a little bit about lower
LM particularly
Venus Venus disorders arterial
disorders the oral path again I I want
you to focus on Dental pulse
synopsis with oral path pathology
histological slides of
important diseases or important
pathologies for example like you're
talking about cysts okay so you I want
you to check radicular cyst I want you
to check OK okay both I mean
radiographically histologically and the
clinically okay because if they want to
give a question on a pathology they will
be asking questions on the most common
pathologist most common pathologist
they'll be asking okay right so I want
you to check most common pathologist in
everything okay particularly Dental P
synopsis uh then jumping into fourth
year subjects oral medicine is done with
oral pathology so Radiology I want you
to focus on
synopsis of dental
pulse okay
uh then uh
pedo maybe a little bit about uh the
tables which were given in your PP books
about child
psychology a little bit about PP books I
want you to do maybe
Milestones PP books uh tables has to be
done same Oro also I want you to stick
on to the same thing PP
books because you don't have great uh
synopsis part in your dental PS Okay so
I want you to stick onto Power Play
Books even for oral medicine Radiology
if you're all if you're if you're
previously done with PP books PP books
is a good source of
revision so then
pero uh perio I want you to focus on
quick
revision quick revision aspects of
pero uh don't miss the suturing
techniques don't miss the sutures
don't miss the
instrumentation instruments and
instrumentations okay again here also I
strongly recommend you to do the pp
books if you're already done okay if
you're not done don't touch it we're
already done it's good source to do the
revision
properly uh then comes the second part
Community quick revision is the best
option quick revision videos
or else if you have PP books you done
with PP books previously they are good
source of revision make sure uh to has
to be done properly test of significance
sampling techniques has to be
done uh properly and followed by indices
has to be revised
properly and I want you to focus more on
fluides fluorides has to be done must do
don't miss them Paka you'll be having
questions on the
series uh then after community and
talking about oral surgery oral surgery
I want you to focus more on
factures okay let's focus more on
factures and maybe quick revision quick
revision video is going to help
you pul synopsis is too
vast I don't think pul synopsis is going
to have a great hard down in the last 10
days but I want you to focus more on
factures and most common
things
don't miss them factures don't miss them
okay and quick revision video don't miss
it so then comes
Prosthetics Dental PSE
synopsis 20
Endo quick
revision quick revision plus PP books
good good source to revise
cons quick revision
plus PP books good source to
revise
implants PB books good source to
revise forensic orology PB
books good source to revise have I
missed any
subject
have I missed any subject Aro is
done AR is done PP books are the good
source of
revision done I'm done with all subjects
right okay don't miss these things okay
these are not must do things if you have
already done these things don't miss
these things these are the good source
of uh revising those areas pra is done
proo Dental pul synopsis okay right so
uh make sure uh in the revision in the
last 10 days revision you should give uh
more priority you should give more
priority to uh memory based aspects okay
so memory based aspects what priority
has to be given is more priority to the
memory based ass particularly
classifications okay because I feel
classification are memory based and
similarly you have tables okay you
you're going to have tables right when
you're talking about heart sounds
example I'm giving heart sounds first
heart sound so the explanation of first
second all these heart sounds is a table
murmur is a table okay right if you're
talking
about clasps different types of clasps
used in proo which are given in the
explanation part is a table again okay
so most of these are tables okay so
revision of uh
okay so revision of
tables and revision of uh the
explanation parts I mean the
particularly the classifications and all
these things uh make sure keep it as a
priority so when you're checking like
Endo you have more classifications when
you're checking like DM you have more
classifications uh like operative
Dentistry is going to have more
classifications okay right uh so talking
about Community indices are important
memory based solidly they are memory
based okay so give more time to such
areas memory based aspects so indices
you have to read it properly okay uh
Prosthetics when I'm talking about RPD
okay so your major connectors questions
are high chances of questions are coming
this is this is a completely memory
based so you need to learn them clasps
you need to learn them finish lenses is
a table you can manage so you can skip
it fontic is a table you can manage you
can skip it okay so this is how you need
to uh be smart okay topics where you are
confident you need to skip them okay so
don't come out with a with a mindset
that okay I need to see everything I
need to revise everything no if you want
to see everything if you want to revise
everything we may not touch 202 or 23
subjects what we have discussed we can
hit up to 12 or 15 so we need to get
compromised completely in five to six
subjects which is not at all a right
advice so being smart in the last 10
days is touching all the subjects it
doesn't mean touching all the topics are
all the subtopics of all the subjects
touching all the subjects touching the
topics which you are not confident
touching the topics which requires a
look which requires a look which
requires a revision okay right for
example uh I want to check out a
particular classification okay I want to
read a particular classification I want
to see okay I'm I'm a little bit
confused about this class three and
class four okay I'll check those jump
but a particular classification which is
which I feel like I need to go and spend
some time like maybe four or five
minutes okay so that is completely your
judgment okay like if you feel like you
want to do offline papers as a source of
revision because I told you right there
are few students keeping uh a revision
of a particular thing only exclusively
focusing on online papers offline papers
or exclusively focusing on prol papers
yes that's a good good choice because
whatever I have stressed out for example
like I'm talking about Ender quick
revision Ender quick revision is already
included in your PR papers Endo quick
revision is already included in your
offline papers okay or for example cons
quick revision plus PB books yes cons
quick rision plus PP books is already
covered in offline papers so it is your
wish okay you want to stick on to a
particular thing that is your game if
you're not clear then I want you to
shift to this particular things focus on
more on these things okay and that's
what I'm telling I'm not giving a
suggestion I am telling don't skip these
things don't skip these things most most
of the things what I have stressed out
here are memory based things here are
classification based things here are
tables okay so my point is these are not
must do these are not to be
missed I hope it's very very clear right
okay right so the main uh aspect why I
have initiated this uh live session was
done from my side okay so before closing
the session my uh I mean suggestion for
all of you is don't uh OV exaggerate
your preparation okay I see like uh
there are many good students uh in the
last n 8 to N9 years of MDS conquer
including me I'm also a better student
okay including me I'm also a better
student most of the good students okay
have spoiled the exam including me okay
I'm also I have also done my best during
my preparation but uh if you check out
my ranking to the knowledge I have or to
the efforts I kept during the
preparation phase it was not properly
reciprocated because I I am over
exaggerated okay I'm over exaggerated
unnecessary
aspects wasting my time on unnecessary
aspects like for example if I have a
doubt uh what I used to do is during my
preparation phase uh if I have a doubt
my mind is so like I don't know why I I
used to think like that so I was more
involved to message my mentors three or
four mentors seniors I used to have two
or three groups uh in which I posted
disc disc it I don't know why I wasted
my valuable time of Revision in the last
one month on doubt solving I used to
help in solving the doubts of others I
used to waste my time on solving my
doubts and finally those doubts which I
have discussed in my last uh one month
of the preparation time during uh 10
years back were same doubts till the
date because they are controversial
questions okay so there's no point it's
it's it's bed of of time okay it's waste
of time at the end of after 10 years
with my experience what I can tell you
is whatever I have done during my
preparation in those days in the last
one month is really waste of time okay
it's really waste of time why I have
wasted this I'm I don't have an answer
at that time but now I have an answer
okay so these are like over exaggerated
students H if it comes what happens okay
uh so I I I'll tell the answer is this
could be the better answer if both are
given why he will give both how much
probability is there for a question to
come and how much probability is there
for a paper set to give both the options
okay both B and C are correct okay learn
and move on if both are given what is
the answer what is the answer no one
knows point is no one knows because
do do you know guys that uh neit is not
going to release the question paper out
you know this right yes or no neat is
not going to release the question paper
out in is not going to release the
question paper out be clear it's not
mset 11th and 12th standard story is
different okay second thing neat and
inct not going to release the key out no
key also no question paper no
key okay they will release only your
marks and ranks okay so for example
you're fighting for something and coming
out and if they're giving the key then
we will know what is the outcome of this
yes you fought so hard and you are the
winner no you fight for something your
answer is a I fight for something my
answer is B we don't know what is the
final answer that is given by the NB
people okay right okay so then there's
no point of wasting a time on a
particular question which is a question
for everyone okay so my point is
whenever I mean after 10 years what I
can tell you is whenever I find a
controversial question I'll try to read
the background of the question for
example you have a question a
controversial question on ML blastoma
what I will do I will try to read
everything about ml Blasta rather than
wasting my time on fighting the answer
getting the answer for this bloody
question I'll open sharers and I'll read
entire M Blasta that is simple rather
than fighting was wasting your time on a
particular question okay so that is one
golden suggestion I want you to give the
second suggestion I want you to give is
don't think about the outcome you see
Mahendra Singh doni Mahendra Singh doni
is the most coolest skep
I don't know whether he's a great
captain or not if you check out he's the
most coolest guy okay and most coolest
Captain you don't see that frustration
on the face of doni at any time in his
in his lengthy facee of career even if
you see Rohit Sharma is doing good but
you see the frustration you see Ki as a
captain you see the frustration on the
face when things were not going good and
you check out Mahendra Singh doni okay
uh he's a very cool guy and if you check
out the World Cups most of the World
Cups where we have lost recently many
World Cups we have lost in the final but
Mahendra Singh doni because of his cool
nature of which what he has mentioned in
the team there are many matches which we
should lose but we made it
possible you see one match like India
versus Pakistan final of 2007 World Cup
T20 World Cup yes there is a high
chances we should lose that match why we
won that match is just because of the
presence of Mind of the captain
or like you check out there are many
matches in 2011 World Cup which we have
to lose okay but it is the presence
of mind and the captain like you see
like one final match we we we we we
should lose it with Bangladesh okay they
need to hit some two or three runs and
Don presence of mind has made it
possible okay so here the presence of
mind is more important okay this is a
very simple exam uh don't OV exaggerate
yourself okay to do this to do that what
happens if I don't get this okay leave
about all these stories nonsense this is
all okay nothing is going to happen even
if you don't get a rank let it be let it
be very clear uh I mean
2012 uh I have given the neat
examination which the exam was cancelled
after giving okay you you may have such
Swit souls in your ex F 2013 I have
given my exam I got a seat okay but uh I
have a different plan okay I have a
different plan uh so I have quitted the
seat okay right so my motto is to get
getting into government Dental callus
okay so so again I have restarted the
preparation after quitting a pedo seat
in a private colus then I have again I
have given an
exam targeting only for a
GDC so I I have missed the GDC just by
one Mark okay but finally I joined in
the private col that's what I'm telling
there's nothing to lose here okay so sir
what happens if I don't get a GDC
something will happen yeah don't worry
okay something will happen don't don't
all this is what I have done during my
preparation I got a seat a category I
have quitted it just to join a
government Dental College in the next
year because I'm confident about that
okay I have done my best but things are
not possible on other side because God
has a different plan to me okay it's not
about a GDC more than a GDC his plan is
to get get into get give me a knowledge
or give me a space is of more than a GDC
So I entered into a college into a
department where everyone is supporting
and made MDS conquer possible this day
so if I am in GDC there would be no MDS
conquer okay as I am not in GDC I have
done MDS conquer nine batches you're the
Ninth Batch and I have started the 10th
batch also I'm doing my life very very
good okay because God has a better plan
in accommodating the things I got
married to my sub Junior if I'm in GDC I
don't know this is going to happen right
okay now I I got my life partner also in
the same College in the same Department
I have the best mentors in the same
Department I have best juniors in the
same Department I have best seniors who
used to help me in doing my things in
the same Department because that is
God's plan he's he's planning to give
you more than
GDC so don't over exited sir my parents
will not allow if I don't get a GDC I'm
GDC GDC this GDC will kill you okay kill
your mindset kill your question paper
okay let's go
give Your Best Shot you will be rewarded
with more than a government Dental
College seat that is the life of
Dentistry so Dentistry is beyond GDC
that's what I'm telling okay if you are
in GDC you're stucking yourself if you
are working to be the best you will be
rewarded with more than GDC okay so at
least these 10 days remove that blady
concept of getting into government
Dental College from your mind okay and
come out with a concept that these 10
days I'm going to give the best to
myself good quality of reading good
quality of building the confidence good
quality of spending quality of time with
you who is going to help you it's
you I'll tell stories yeah I'll tell so
many stories okay it's okay if you want
me to tell stories I'll tell stories but
who is going to help you the right
person who is going to help you is you
you have to help yourself I was not
rewarded with the government Dental
College even after giving the exam for
second time who helped me
me I was in a private color was not in a
position to decide whether I need to
start my journey with PG training or
something who helped me it's me no one
has helped me it's me who has written
the pp books it's me who has typed the
pp books it's me who has printed the pp
books it's me even if even in the
offline or even even if a pro live
tomorrow a PR live class is there okay
if someone is not there for example my
attender is not there who is going to do
the pr paper editing it's me okay so the
game is yours it's always you who is
going to help you out at any situation
okay don't expect someone to come out
and help you and do magics so GDC is
just a tag it's not going to change
anything around you except the financial
support that is going to uh given to you
for the next three years okay that's
that's a benefit for GDC but who is more
important in the journey is it's you
okay so I don't want you to
stro your brain keep stress to your
brain keep anxiety to the brain you need
to get this you need to get that uh this
this exam I got 600 next exam I should
get more than 600 what is this logic I
don't understand how can you get more
than 600 the next exam the paper may be
tough logic L right you you always
determine yourself okay suddenly some
bouncer is coming even if it is bouncer
I need to hit it
six no change change the aspect okay
let's give the best your best
examination magical examination should
be on March 18 okay done so these are
the suggestions from my side maybe as
you progress deep into your life you
will attain this maturity maybe after
five years you you're going to motivate
few other people as a mentor or as a
teacher uh as a professor in your
respective colleges okay but I think we
can do this okay even even with a even
with a people with Les maturity less
experience can do this I have seen uh a
decent I I have seen many students when
I was talking to them like I felt very
sweet okay I felt like how these guys at
a Litt a have got this maturity like I
was an intern I was blind okay I was
blind I don't know what I'm doing I
don't know for what I doing I used to
spend waste my time on my friends waste
my time on XYZ factors but you see a
quality of five or 10 uh students in
every College they are more
matured uh compared to me now after 10
years if you see the maturity levels
they are doing good okay it's really
wonderful and sweet to meet such
category of people every year okay right
uh right so that is these are the few
things which I felt like suggesting you
uh these are the must do okay right
focus on more on uh revision of uh the
mocks revision of modules questions
questions and the relevant explanation
part if you're not if you're if you're
in if you're not very uh like if you're
so confused like what to be done to get
a good rank my suggestion is mock
modules are very good source of uh
revision because vast subject very
important areas were covered in those
things okay right so those are
suggestions from my side and probably
the recorded version I'll upload you on
the YouTube channel
and you can watch it study well take
care I'll be with you don't worry I'll
be with you the main reason why I'm not
coming to live is unnecessary
discussions unnecessary talks it is
something like if I go to live if I'm if
I'm I mean individually I'm I'm I'm
responding you on WhatsApp so if I keep
a live or if I go to offline I feel like
it is like uh taking a chewing gum and
sticking to your hands what happens if
you take a chewing gum and stick to your
hands
what happens what happens right so I
don't want you to create that irritation
okay let's have uh and do well okay take
care study well bye-bye see you okay
right

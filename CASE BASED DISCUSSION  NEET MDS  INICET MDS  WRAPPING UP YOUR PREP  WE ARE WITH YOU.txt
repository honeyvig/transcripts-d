hi everyone this is dr g sayeth
team mds concur so we have discussed few
number of cases in the part one
we'll be discussing few more cases now
okay so coming to the first one
so here a male infant is presented with
asymptomatic erythematous
discriminative lesions in the hands and
feet which were noticed at birth and
he was born to a 35 year old mother who
had a poor prenatal care because of
socio-economic reasons
and there was a diffuse arithmetist
trans gradient palmer planter
keratoderma
with discrimination and fissures as you
can see in the picture so what are the
other findings that you can expect in
this baby
during the later stage of the disease so
here if you see
first let's conclude what exactly the
disease could be
so as per the findings that is being
given so it is nothing but congenital
syphilis
okay so what are the other findings that
you can expect now
so first yes dwarfed molars with cusps
covered with
globular enamel growths which is nothing
but the mulberry molars right yes
even that can be seen which is a part of
the hutchinson's triad right
next a scapula in which the vertebral
broader below the spine presents
concavity instead of convexity yes
so this is called as caproid
scapulae okay yes even this can be seen
next eighth cranial nerve deafness yes
it's also one of the constant of the
huttington's triad even that can be seen
next anterior bowing of the middle
portion of the tibia
even yes this can be seen it's nothing
but the shape or shin
okay so even this can be observed as a
skeletal change in the patient
the thickening of the clavicular portion
of the clavicle yes this is nothing but
the higgo
minakis sign even this can be seen in
this
child in a later stage so yes the answer
is all the above so all these signs
or all these other features related to
the congenital syphilis
so which can be seen in this infant okay
so what are the features which has been
listed out in this table
so do go through all the features that
have been listed out so facial features
like the frontal bossing saddle nose
short maxillon protuber and mandible
ophthalmic creatures like the
interstitial keratitis secondary
glaucoma chorioretinitis corneal
scarring and optic atrophy
ears showing the hearing loss or
with such simpson's teeth and mulberry
molars cutaneous like the regates
cnas like the intellectual disability
arrested hydrocephalus caesar's optic
atrophy
okay and very importantly the skeletal
changes so first one
shea buchen which is nothing but the
anterior bowing of the tibia
higuminaki sign wherein there is
enlargement of the sternoclavicular
portion of the clavicle
clattons joint wherein there will be
painless arthritis
and scaphoid scapulae so all these are
the very important features
which you need to know regarding the
congenital syphilis
so if you see this is a pictorial
presentation so this is being the
scaphoid scapulae here you can see the
frontal embossing in the saddle nose and
this is being the higgo minaki sign
wherein you can see the irregular
thickening
of the clavicle the sternoclavicular
portion of the clavicle and yes here you
can see the bowing of the tibia the
anterior bowing of the tibia
so which is nothing but the shear but
shin so all these are the important
skeletal or the important features
related to the congenital syphilis which
you need to know
next question the following picture
reveals an anomaly which is related to
the development of tooth and this
anomaly
occurs due to interruption of which of
the following stage of the development
so here if you see there is a tooth
within tooth appearance and it is seen
involving the lateral incisor so
this would have occurred because of a
disturbance in the cap stage of the
tooth development
so answer is pretty clear it is dense
invaginates which shows tooth within
tooth appearance
and it is seen commonly with the lateral
incisor so if you see the stages of
tooth development we are very well aware
of it so the placard stays a butt stage
okay wherein there will be like a bud in
the butt stage and here
the main process is a proliferation
okay whereas in the cap stage the
process which take a main role as a
proliferation
differentiation
and morphogenesis
okay so these are the three main process
which occur in the cap stage so if there
is a disturbance
in the development of tooth like dense
indentee gemination like that
so these would have occurred because of
the disturbance in the pdm that is
proliferation differentiation of
morphogenesis
that would have occurred at the cap
stage that occurs at the capsule so if
there is an interruption at the cap
stage
then the dense invaginate is occurs okay
so answer for this question is the cap
stage
next is the bell stage okay so we know
the bell stage
so these are the stages of the tooth
development so mainly remember
the pdm occurs at the cap stage and if
there is a differentiation
in or if there is a disturbance then
obviously there is problem or there is a
disturbance like the germination or
other disturbances like the dense
invaginators whereas microdon shear
microdonsia
if there's such developmental
disturbance and that would have occurred
at the
bell stage okay so this is regarding
this particular question
now next here there is a 45 year old
female who has presented with multiple
or numerous raised solid lesions over
the neck axilla
and ground and forehead since four years
and she was born
with an extra digit on the right hand
and on the left foot okay the former got
amputated surgically two decades back
and she also underwent
subtotal thyroidectomy very important to
underline
for multinodular goiter two years ago
and physical examination has shown
pallor macrocephaly syndactyly and
polydactyly
okay so this is again important and
dermatological lesions if you see
there is multiple forehead papules skin
tags over the neck axilla and the groin
and there is a cervical scar of
thyroidectomy with and also there is a
cobblestone
tongue with closed papules okay so what
is the inheritance of your diagnosis so
first let's decide what is the diagnosis
here so if you see there are
multiple squamous papillomas right and
also the papillomas are seen as well as
on the tongue as described in the
question so it is nothing but the coward
and syndrome
the syndrome which is associated with
multiple papillomas is nothing but the
cowan syndrome
and that is autosomal dominant okay so
these are the important features of the
cowden syndrome
so the mucocutaneous manifestations
include the
trichloromas papillomavirus papules and
acural keratosis okay so 99 percent
all these are very important
manifestation besides that in the breast
lesions the patient will have
carcinoma like adenocarcinoma and also
the patients will have macrocephaly
and thyroid abnormalities so here in our
patient the patient is having
multinodular gauter for which she has
underwent
thyroidectomy right so this is being
given in the question
and also the other symptoms like the
gastrointestinal lesions and
genetic urinary urinary abnormalities so
all these are the important features
related to the
cow and syndrome so in our particular
patient there are multiple papillomas
there is multi-nodular gauter so which
goes in favor of cowden syndrome which
is
autosomal dominant okay
so these are the criteria that is being
given so the pathognomic criteria there
should be six or more facial papules
okay and along with oral mucosa
papillomatosis so here even the
cobblestone appearance of the tongue
says that the oral mucus is also
involved and there should be acryl
keratosis
and palma plantar keratosis so this is a
pathognomic criteria
besides that breast cancer thyroid
cancer macrocephaly
okay endometrium cancer and hermity
duckloss disease so which is nothing but
the dysplastic cerebral
cytoma so that is nothing but hermities
the closed disease which is different
from the hermities sign
okay so the hermity duclose disease is
dysplastic cerebellar
ganglocytoma okay whereas hermetic sign
is a shock like sensation
which is seen in patients with multiple
sclerosis on the flexion of the neck
okay so this is regarding the criteria
important for the cowden syndrome so
just note it down
and the other minor criteria just give a
glance okay
so yes uh the next question and 34 year
old man had
a non-healing oral ulcer on his left
inner commissure and left label
vestibule the ulcers were roughly over
in shape with irregular placentic
borders and the
edges were thin and undermined with
slight induration at the base and
tenderness was also elicited
on palpation here the key point is
undermined edges underlined that
and there was no history of cough or
fever or hemoptysis and weight loss
and on smear examination of the ulcer
acid fast bacilli where identified
using the jail nielsen stain so here
undermined edges
acid fast vaseline so it's a direct
question so it is nothing but the
tuberculosis ulcer so it can't be
squamous cell carcinoma
can be fungal ulcer and it even it
cannot be hepatic ulcer because
the smear has given a pretty clear acid
fast bacilli and also the edges are
undermined
which goes in favor of tuberculosis also
without pulmonary involvement why
because a patient is not having
any symptoms related to the pulmonary
involvement like cough or hemoptysis and
other symptoms
like fever right so it's better you go
for tuberculosis also without pulmonary
involvement
okay so next question a 15 year old male
patient was being admitted to the
hospital
having experienced repeated fractures
over a period of three years and the
clinical signs
and radiographic features has shown
recurrent fractures
loose clearer with low bone mineral
density
blue is clear of the eyes was observed
okay
so there was no hearing loss again and
which of the following
collagen is affected in this condition
so it's again a direct question so blue
is clear of the eyes repeated fractures
low density
or mineral density of the bone you can
go for osteogenesis imperfecta
where the type one collagen is being
affected okay so answer is
type one okay so this is regarding few
more case
based discussions i hope you have got an
idea of how to answer in your exam
okay thank you

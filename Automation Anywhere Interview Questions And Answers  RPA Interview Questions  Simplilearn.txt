what is an enterprise control room and
how does it work
the enterprise control room serves as a
single point of management for all bots
the enterprise control room manages
schedules
executes and configures various bots and
bot runner capabilities using a
collection of specialized web services
the enterprise control room is placed on
a server in the data center and
configured to work with the other data
center components
explain the different type of bots in
automation anywhere
task bot task boards are used for
automating repetitive tasks based on the
rules
these tasks are simple to create and can
reliably complete multi-step procedures
document administration claims
management hr departments i.t and other
areas benefit from task bots
metabot metabots are more advanced
version of task bots metabots are
automation building components that help
with next generation integration
scalability
these are intended for a scalable
complex process
on a computer metabots are used to
automate applications
iqbot iqbots are the next generation of
intelligent bots
with the ability to think like humans
these bots are designed to learn on
their own and carry out tasks in
accordance with that learning
iq bots also learn to recognize patterns
so that the bot knows exactly what to do
the next time the pattern appears with
each human confirmation it learns and
improves its ability to carry out the
act
explain briefly the architecture of
automation anywhere
automation anywhere platform is built
using a distributed architecture the
enterprise control room is a web-based
platform that manages the development
and execution of digital workforce and
provides a centralized management
bot creators and bot runners are linked
to the enterprise control room
bot creators are software development
platforms for authorizing and
customizing automations
bot runners are runtime system deployed
on machines that carry out the
automations
bot runners can be installed on desktops
in data centers or in the cloud
what is a bot creator
a bot is a self-contained task that
requires little to no human intervention
to complete the bot creator is a
customized development client for
automation anywhere that is used to
create bots
task editor event watcher bot player
auto login and local scheduler are all
included
the bot creator also includes the
ability to create bots from a device
utilizing the enterprise client
application
the device is registered with the
enterprise control room after the bot
creator user signs in for the first time
and the user can deploy bots on that
device
what is a bot runner
a bot runner has ability to run bots
from a device utilizing the enterprise
client application the device is
registered with the enterprise control
room after the bot runner user locks in
for the first time and the user can
deploy bots on that device
bots are run by bot runner which is a
software machine bot runners can run
bots at a scale after they have been
developed by the bot creator
explain triggers in automation anywhere
triggers integrate predefined events
into your process reducing the amount of
tasks that users must do repeatedly in
automation anywhere you can use
attendant automation to create unique
triggers for numerous apps these
triggers can then be used to launch a
bot
at triggers to have the bot execute
automatically whenever a specified event
occurs for instance pressing a specific
key or series of key strokes
explain the benefits of automation
anywhere
time saving an easy to use interface
that allows users of varying skill
levels to easily use the product and
accelerate the learning process
with instant web-based deployment you
can get started with writing bots right
away
business adaptability
automation anywhere provides regular
updates ensuring that you are always up
to date on any device anywhere it
provides continuity of operations with
high availability and disaster recovery
low cost of ownership
there is no need for additional
infrastructure investment a unified
platform for front office back office
and employee applications
it gives lower maintenance cost
what are bought
insights the analytics platform that
delivers real-time interactive and
intelligent insights into business
process and operational intelligence
bot insight takes a large amount of
content level and productivity data
generated by deployed bots and converts
it into insights via automatically
generated and customizable dashboards
what are the different excel packages
that automation anywhere offers
automation anywhere offers three
different excel packages
excel advanced package it's utilized to
automate actions involving the workbook
worksheet rows columns and cells the
system must have microsoft office
installed the versions of microsoft
office that are supported range from
2016 to microsoft office 2019.
excel basic package enables quick
spreadsheet activities for dot xlsx
files without requiring the msxl
software to be installed
office 365 excel it provides commands
for working with excel online the office
365 xl bundle includes actions that
allow you to automate operations in
microsoft excel online if you are using
microsoft excel 365 via a web browser
you can use the office 365 excel package
to automate excel process
let us look at the intermediate level
questions
explain functions of the following excel
commands
open spreadsheet
allows to open the excel spreadsheet
close spreadsheet closes a spreadsheet
that was opened
save spreadsheet saves a spreadsheet in
an open workbook
activate spreadsheet activates a
specific spreadsheet in an open workbook
it specifies whether to activate the
sheet by index or sheet by name
get cell allows to retrieve the values
of a specific cell as well as the range
of the cell
set cell sets the value of the active
cell or a specific cell in an excel
spreadsheet
you can assign a variable to the cell
value
go to cell move to a specific cell
within a spreadsheet
delete cell
delete the value of a specific cell
within a excel spreadsheet
run excel macro
runs a macro that is stored within an
excel spreadsheet enter the macro name
and specify the parameters of the macro
arguments
explain the types of triggers to start
abort
email
in email trigger a bot is launched when
a new email message arrives in the given
email service
such as microsoft outlook email server
or ews server
file and folder when a predefined file
or folder event occurs it starts a bot
as the trigger you can choose from the
following options like when you make a
new file or a folder or when a file or a
folder that already exists gets
destroyed or when you rename a file or a
folder
the next type is hotkey
when a predetermined combination of
keystrokes is performed on the keyboard
a bot is launched
as the trigger you can use any
combination
like control alt windows
and escape are all control keys
particular alphabetical characters are
used in the key
interface when a predetermined event
occurs on the selected user interface
element abort is launched
some instances of pre-configured events
are a button is pressed by the user or
an application is opened or closed by
the user a checkbox is selected or
cleared by the user
how to record the task with universal
recorder
step 1 create a new bot or open an
existing bot
then click on the start recording and
select universal recording
step 3 perform the required steps and
click on finish
step 4 edit the actions and click on
save
let's jump into the automation in our
control room and see how to record the
task with universal recorder
so here we are in the control room we
have created a new bot
so let's search for a message box
double click on the message box
enter a message
close message box after 5 seconds
now go to start recording or you can
press control plus r
click on start recording
and select the window which you want to
record
so
i'll select the calculator
and click on universal recorder
and now you can perform actions
so i'm adding the numbers
um
so i have randomly performed some
actions now i'll click on finish and
let's finish the
recording
now let us save and click on run
so here you can see the message is
displayed hello it will close in 5
seconds and it has closed
and the recording is been played
and it shows the actions which we have
recorded
you can see your bot has run
successfully
how to clone a bot in automation
anywhere
create a read-only duplicate of the bot
in the private workspace from the public
workspace so you can have a local copy
without checking it out
step 1 login to the control room
as a bot creator user
and then in public space click bots the
my bot page is displayed with the list
of folders or files containing the bot
then select the bot you want to clone
click the actions menu and click clone
task bot the clone bot appears in the
same folder structure in the private
workspace
so let's jump into the automation in our
control room and see how to clone a bot
so this is the my bot folder
so these are the bots which i have
created
so let's go to this python board select
this bot and go to the options
and
click here copy task bot
and here you can see a copy of that bot
is been created and name the bot
whatever you want so i'll keep the
default name python board copy one and
click on copy you can select the folder
where you want to store it
i have kept the default folders
and here you can see python board copy
one has been successfully created
so that is how you clone a bot
explain the following commands delay
command weight command and task command
the delay command is used to delay the
execution of next command for a set
length of time
you have the option of specifying the
time in milliseconds or seconds
weight command the weight command is
used to add a condition that forces the
next set of actions to wait for the
contents of a screen to change before
proceeding
task command
task command is used to start a task
within a task or pause it and stop it
explain predefined variables in
automation anywhere
predefined variables are variables that
provide specific information about the
machine on which the bot is run
the values of a preset variable cannot
be changed by users
below are the examples of predefined
variables
clipboard
date and time
string
and system settings and parameters
explain the date time predefined
variables in automation anywhere
using the datetime packages activities
you can manipulate date and time
variables
date returns a date that includes the
hours minutes and seconds
day the day is written in date format
r is a function that returns the rs in
as format
machine the device name is returned as a
string by the machine
millisecond millisecond returns a value
between 0 and triple 9 milliseconds
minute
the minutes are returned in minute
format
month month is a function that returns
the month in month format
seconds the seconds are returned in
seconds format
year returns the current year in the
year format
how are loops used to control a bot in
automation anywhere
loops are one of the most powerful board
building constructions loops are the
instructions that repeat a set of
actions a certain number of times or
until a condition is met
when a loop checks for the completion of
a defined number of iterations or
satisfaction of a condition
if not satisfied the loop is executed
the same conditions are checked
repeatedly until the condition has been
satisfied if the condition is satisfied
then the loop is not being executed
explain error handling and automation
anywhere
error handling in automation anywhere
consists of the error handler package
that comprises actions that make it
simple to handle exceptions that abort
encounters and pass control to the bot's
other activities
you can use the error handler actions to
separate the actions that you can't use
to complete a task from the actions or
to handle an exception
when a bot meets an error handling
exceptions ensure that the work is
complete
how is automation anywhere different
from uipath
on the basis of single integrated
automation platform automation anywhere
provides intelligent automation platform
like attended automation unattended
automation intelligent document
processing and many more
whereas uipath requires third party
products and integration to deliver a
similar solution
increasing installation and support
complexity
modern architecture automation anywhere
provides efficient java based
microservice architecture ensuring
scalability reducing the cost of
infrastructure and maintenance
ui path on the other hand built on a
legacy window workflow foundation with
the last update released in 2012 the
scalability is slow and difficult due to
lack of modularity
ease of use
in automation anywhere the easy-to-use
platform enables regular employees to
create their own automation
but uipath is targeted towards the
developer community and needs more
intervention from it and development
team
most secure and compliant
automation anywhere
provides the best in-class security
standard whereas uipath has incomplete
security certifications that create
business and compliance risk
easier to scale
automation anywhere quickly scales to
thousands of bots in front and back
office no matter the type attended
unattended or document processing
ui paths architecture unable to scale
horizontally and require to duplication
of entire application for every service
expansion
quicker roi
in automation anywhere the modern
microservices architecture enables a
platform to scale both vertically and
horizontally delivering faster roi
in ui path with most deployments limited
to a single digit large scale
deployments become difficult
explain javascript package in automation
anywhere the javascript package contains
actions that allow a bot to run
javascript
on windows linux and unix-based devices
these activities can launch javascript
the javascript includes the following
actions open
this action opens a javascript file in
automation anywhere
close this action closes the session and
specifies the same session name from the
open action
run javascript action runs a function
within the java script
now let us look at some of the advanced
level automation anywhere interview
questions
how to write inline scripts using python
command in automation anywhere
step 1 create a new bot and step 2 drag
and drop the following actions
that is python script open
execute function and python script close
finally add a message box to display the
result variable
us go to the automation in our control
room
so i have already created a bot
i'll open that bot
search for the python script
package
from the python script package drag and
drop the open function
in the open function specify the session
name if you already have an existing
file on your device then select the
import existing device and enter the
file path
or you can enter the input manually so i
have entered the input manually in which
i have defined a function
function which i have named it as name
and i have called an argument called
string
and i have returned that argument so
select the python runtime version in my
device python version 3 is installed so
i have selected the three
and then drag and drop the python script
in this enter the session name and enter
the name of function to be executed as
you can see here in the previous open
action i have entered the function name
as
name
so and enter this in the python script
action enter the name of the function
then argument to the function create a
variable so i have created a variable
and named it as python variable
so and i have assigned the value to this
variable
and i have assigned a value called
thanks to this variable
and then in the display message
enter the variable which you had created
so we had created
the variable python variable and
assigned it
so enter the variable
just second
so select the variable and then close
the message box after 10 seconds then
once you open the python script then we
have to close the python script as well
and the session name should be the same
so for in detail explanation and better
understanding check out our tutorial on
automation anywhere using python check
out this video in which i have explained
all the steps in detail how python is
used in automation anyway
so now we'll click on save and
click on save
and run this
downloading
dependencies downloading dependencies
and here you go the message from the bot
is being displayed as thanks this was
the value which we had assigned to the
variable
and the window will close in 10 seconds
how to create a credential in automation
anywhere
step 1 navigate to bots and go to the
credentials section
then enter the credential name and
description for the configured
credential
then enter the attribute name and supply
the description for the attribute then
select the external keyword then select
input standard or user provided set the
security and click create credential
let's go to the automation anywhere and
create a credential
in the control room
go to manage
in the manage you can see credentials
click on credentials
and if you if you go here you can see
create credential click on create
credential
enter the credential name enter the
credential description which is optional
then scroll down
and enter the attribute name
whatever the attribute you want enter
the attribute name and enter the
description which is optional and
provide the input either you can keep
the input standard or user provided when
you keep the input as user provided when
the credential is added to the locker an
email will be sent to the consumer of
the locker so you will receive an email
but we don't want to receive an email so
we'll keep it as standard
and enter the value
so enter the value of the attribute
which you are creating and you can keep
the value it must when you keep it
masked the value gets encrypted usually
we use it for passwords when you enter
the password we encrypt the value that
is why we select mask and you can create
the attribute like this and if you want
you can create multiple attributes click
on plus and you can create the multiple
attributes once you have created the
attributes then when you scroll up here
you can see this option create
credential this option will get enabled
then you click on create credential and
the credential gets created
this is how you create a credential
how to set up a locker and assign
credentials
step 1 create and assign roles step 2
create a credential and step 3 create a
locker
so it is very simple let's go to the
control room
go to the credentials sections in this
you can see the lockers option here go
to lockers
and
click on create locker
once you click on create blocker enter
the locker name enter the description
so in the credentials whatever
credentials you have created will be
shown here
so i have already deposited this
credential in the locker that is why it
is disabled for me
so once you have created the credential
check this box select the credential and
click here to deposit this credential in
the locker once that is done go to the
owners
and
select the owner
so your owner email address will be
shown here
select that email address and deposit
that in the locker once that is done go
to managers this is optional and this
manager is not enabled in the community
edition
and even the participants this is also
not enabled in the community edition so
skip these two steps and go to consumers
and in consumers check the community
edition user and deposit that in the
locker
once this much is done you can see this
option create locker this option will
get enabled
so click on create locker and the
blocker will get created check out my
previous video on automation anywhere
excel operations in which i have shown
how to create a credential and how to
create a locker in detail
create a bot to login web page using
automation anywhere actions using the
above question are as follows
we will use the browser package that
contains actions that enable you to
download files find broken lines and
launch a website
it contains a capture action from the
recorder package to capture an
interaction with the user interface
object such as text box button table etc
let's go to the automation anywhere
control room and create a bot to log in
web page using automation anywhere
so this is the login bot which i have
already created you can check out our
automation anywhere tutorial in which i
have detailedly explained each step
how to create a bot to login inside any
web page
so basically in this we are using a
browser action
in the browser action we will open it in
the new window
will browse in the google chrome you can
select whichever you want
for now i have selected google chrome
and select the link to open
so in this project i will login inside
the simply learns webpage
so for that i have selected the link
that is the
link in the simply lens
so go to the simply lens web page go to
the login page
and i have copied this link of the login
page
so i have pasted the link to open here
then i have used the recorder package
from the recorder package i have used
the capture action in which in the first
action i'll capture the email address in
the second capture action i'll capture
the password in the third capture action
i'll click on the login button
so i have captured this three action
so let us save and click on run
here you go it has opened the webpage in
the new window
so entering the email address password
and clicking on the login button
and it has logged it inside the simply
learns webpage
and your bot has run successfully
create a bot to merge two data tables
from a different excel sheets into a new
sheet
so to merge two data tables together in
a single data table in automation
anywhere we use merge action from the
data table package
so let's go to automation anywhere so i
have the two excel files file one and
file two so in file one i have
six rows
of employee names and salaries
in file two i have five rows of salary
of salaries and employee names so i'll
merge both these tables into a new excel
sheet
so for that
let us go to
let us go to the automation anywhere
control room you can check out our
automations anywhere excel operations
videos in which we have explained all
the excel operations and actions in
detail
in step one i have selected the file one
that is i have opened the excel file one
and assigned it to get multiple cell
actions and close the file similarly in
step 2 i have opened the file to and
similarly assign the get multiple cells
and close the file tool then from the
data table package
from the data table package i have used
this merged action this merges two data
tables together in a single data table
so i have used this
so i have used this action so
i'll disable the
other actions click on save and run the
file
so the excel bot is running
and a new file name named as result will
be created on the desktop
so the bot has run successfully
let us go to the desktop and see the
result file which got created let us
open this file
and here you can see both the data
tables have been merged into a new excel
files
six first six rows from the file one and
the next five rows from the file tool
have been merged into a single data
table
how to remove duplicate rows from a data
table in automation anywhere
to remove duplicate rows from the data
table use remove duplicate rows action
from the data table package
as you can see in this data table there
there is a duplicate row named john
which is repeated twice
so let us go to automation anywhere
and perform action to remove this
duplicate rows
so let us close this so if you go to the
data table action here you can see
remove duplicate rows so double click on
this and then you will get the double
click on remove duplicate rows and in do
remove duplicate rows select the data
table name
so
i'm selecting the data variable which i
had created so just specify the data
table name and the automation anywhere
will remove the duplicate rows so let us
click on save and
let us run
here you can see the excel bot is
running
it is opening both the excel files it is
checking for duplicate rows and your bot
has successfully run so let us close
this and go to desktop
and here you can see the duplicate row
has been deleted so there was one more
duplicate row with the name john
so that row has been deleted so this is
how you delete duplicate rows in
automation
from the excel from the data table the
last question
how to sort data in the data table using
automation anywhere
to sort data in a data table automation
anywhere provides a sort action from the
data table package
so if you look at this data table you
can see the salaries column
the salaries is not sorted so we'll sort
the salary scholar in the descending
order
the employee with the highest salary
will be at the top and the employee with
the lowest salary will be at the bottom
so let's close this
and we'll enable this sort data action
so what you have to do is select sort
data
action from the data table package
once you select this specify the data
table name and the column name so we
want to sort the column salaries
then select the order in which you want
to sort we'll sort it in the descending
order
click on save and click on run
here you can see deploying to the
computer downloading the dependencies
and the bot is running
so your bot has run successfully let's
go to desktop and open the file results
and here you can see the data is sorted
in the descending order the employee
with the highest salary is at the top
similarly in the decreasing order the
employee with the lowest salary is at
the bottom
so with that we have reached the end of

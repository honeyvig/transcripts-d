>> Hi, folks. My name is David Li.
I am the C++ Game Dev
PM at Visual Studio.
I'm here to talk to you about
some new and exciting changes
in Visual Studio 2022.
Recently, our CEO, Satya Nadella,
has said, as a company,
Microsoft's all-in on gaming.
At Visual Studio, we're
all-in on gaming too.
We have been creating new
and exciting experiences
for Visual Studio based
on your feedback.
Whether your Unreal developer,
an indie game developer,
whether you make your game on
our proprietary engine or
work on AAA game studio,
let me show you why VS
2022 is the IDE for you.
First, let me get started
with the demo on Hot Reload.
Now for game developers,
this might sound familiar to you.
Have you ever spend
30 minutes playing
your game just to get
to a specific state?
Spend all those minutes and hours
getting to that state just to find
out your bug fix didn't work?
Or if you're a technical artist.
If you repeatedly have to restart
a game just to see your
[inaudible] iterations,
Hot Reload is a feature for you.
Let me show you how
Hot Reload works.
Imagine you're building an open
source, cross-platform
[inaudible] project
like Bitfighter here.
In Bitfighter, you have a ship
that has a red round shield.
You can activate the shield
with a press of a button.
Now what if you want to
make the shield a little
bit more exciting?
Let's do that in Visual Studio.
Here, instead of the color red,
I'm going to make it cyan,
and instead of a circle,
I'm going to draw a star.
Normally, without Hot Reload,
you will have to
close down the game,
rebuild it, and click through
the menus just to get
to the same state.
With Hot Reload, all you have to
do is to press the
"Hot Reload" button.
It takes a few seconds
for Hot Reload to run.
Let's see here, a giant
10-point blue star.
Isn't that crazy? Oh, okay.
Maybe that's a little
bit too exciting.
Let's change it back to something
a little bit more reasonable.
Instead of the star,
I'm going to go back to the circle.
But this time, instead of red,
I'm going to change
the color to gold.
Instead of pressing the
"Hot Reload" button,
you can also activate
Hot Reload on File Save.
To enable that,
go to the dropdown next
to the Hot Reload button.
Click "Hot Reload on File Save".
Once that is enabled,
every time you save the game
through Ctrl +S or the Save button,
the change are
automatically applied.
Here, a gold round shield.
Hot Reload supports any changes that
are currently supported
by Edit and Continue,
and is not limited to
only game developers.
With Hot Reload,
you no longer have to
close your application,
recompile it, get the application
back to the same state,
only to find out your
fix doesn't work.
Instead of spending minutes and
hours getting to the same
state when debugging,
take those precious minutes
back with Hot Reload for C++.
Next, let me show you a demo with
Intellicode for Unreal Engine.
We build Intellicode for
Unreal Engine by parsing
many Unreal Engine databases
and making an AI model.
When enabled, Intellicode
for Unreal Engine
shows up in Unreal projects.
For established developers,
Intellicode saves time by suggesting
the most common suggestions and
sorting them to the top
of the member list.
For new developers,
Intellicode suggests the right
APIs in the right place.
For Teams, you can train custom
team models over your codebase,
which makes the effects of
Intellicode even more powerful,
but providing suggestions on
internal types as well as
more specified suggestions based
on your Team's coding patterns.
This also makes it easier
to onboard new developers
as it help suggest things
the Team is using elsewhere.
Here, let me demonstrate how
Intellicode works with member access.
When you press a "Dot",
Intellicode suggestions
will show up with a star.
The star denotes that this
suggestion is from Intellicode.
Similar down here, when you
press the "Dot" operator,
you'll get another
Intellicode base suggestion.
Down below, the Arrow operator
also brings up a list of
Intellicode suggested suggestions
denoted by the stars.
In this case, the top
suggestion is GetController.
With Intellicode for Unreal Engine,
power up your experience of
developing Unreal Engine
games in Visual Studio.
We have been working closely
with Epic Games to make
a great experience of developing
Unreal Engine games
in Visual Studio.
Haven't tried the Unreal Engine?
You can check it out under
the game development with
C++ workload in the
Visual Studio Installer.
One of the things that we have
been working with Epic Games
is increasing the
responsiveness of IntelliSense.
IntelliSense for UE projects
is now significantly more
responsive due to utilizing PCH
when generating VS project files.
Look for this new updates
in a new version of
Unreal Engine 4.27 coming soon.
Similarly, Intellicode
for Unreal Engine
5 is coming in an upcoming release.
What do you want as an Unreal
Engine developer in Visual Studio?
We want to know. Connect
with us on Twitter,
and leave us your feedback.
Aside from making Unreal Engine
IntelliSense improvements,
we have also been making
core performance in
C++ IntelliSense improvements
in Visual Studio 2022.
We have made a test
based on Unreal Engine
4.27, a large project, and
benchmarked it with VS2019
against the VS2022.
The timings we're taking
when VS opens a project for
the first time and subsequent
times average over three runs.
Visual Studio 2022 feels
faster when getting to code.
You can get to code
quicker in Visual Studio
2022 and open the
file twice as fast.
You can also wait less time
for IntelliSense ready.
Get the syntactic
highlighting and code changes
to appear in member
list twice as fast.
With the new improved
IntelliSense performance
in Visual Studio 2022,
you can save seconds each
time you open a file.
We hear pain about IntelliSense
performance with game developers.
Now these are only few
seconds each action.
But imagine, how many times are
you opening a file every day?
How many times are you
waiting for IntelliSense to
open every time you open a new file?
These are only a few seconds
but add up over time.
Especially for bigger
projects, this will scale.
These are small numbers,
but they add up.
We want more feedback because we
aren't done making improvements.
Install Visual Studio 2022
side-by-side with VS2019.
We want to make it easy.
VS2022 is binary compatible with
previous C++ two sets
in 2019 or older.
If you are coming from VS2019,
you may be familiar with our
built throughput improvements.
Let me briefly tell you what you'll
gain from upgrading
to the latest tools.
Using the latest tools,
the Gears 5 team at The
Coalition saw a 2.6.
seven times faster
end-to-end build time and
2.8 faster link time
compared to VS2017.
Similarly, at Turn 10 Studios,
they saw a five times improvement
and link times for
Forza Motorsports.
For Forza Horizon 4,
the link times are now 18 times
faster than in Visual Studio 2017.
The decrease in build time
enabled Playground Games to
switch from /DEBUG:FASTLINK
to /DEBUG:FULL.
You can enjoy all the benefits of
the latest toolsets
by upgrading VS2022.
When you load your projects,
you'll be prompted to upgrade,
but you don't have to.
You can still use the
old compilers and
the older toolsets and
they will still work.
You can enjoy the IDE experience
of Visual Studio 2022 that way.
Third-party libraries
that will also work.

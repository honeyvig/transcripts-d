hello everyone
i welcome you all to simply learn
in today's session
we'll discuss what is bias and
statistics
so
let's start by discussing the agenda for
today's session
we'll start this discussion by
discussing what is biases statistics and
some examples and reasons for the same
then we'll move on to discuss what is
types of biases
and the examples to understand these
types better
so without further delay let's begin
what is bias and statistics
biases statistics is a term that is used
to refer any type of error that we may
find when you use the statistical
analysis
we can say that it is an estimator of a
parameter that may not be confusing with
its degree of precision
the reasons for this bias may be
that the method by which the data is
collected may be faulty
or the way the question is phrased maybe
not accurate
let's see what are the types of biases
the first one is the measurement bias
measurement batch refers to any
systematic or non-random error type that
occurs in the collection of data in a
study
another term that is used for this type
of bias is the detection bias
this difference in observation might be
because of unseen reasons some of them
can be the error that happens while
recording the data or the leading
questions that follows after the data
the error can also occur because the
respondents gave the false answers
suppose you conduct a survey to
determine whether or not someone voted
for president obama
some may have voted for him but the way
the question was put confused the
respondents and they answered wrong
in this case the measurement bias can
occur
the next type of bash is the selection
bias
when you choose your sample or data
incorrectly selection bias occurs there
can be many reasons for this but the
most common reason is when the people
try to work with the data that are
easily available
and
because of that the respondents gave the
first response
let's try to understand this concept
with the help of an example
suppose you are conducting a poll to
determine how people feel about the
current ruling government
you have gathered all the information
that you need unfortunately many of them
say that twitter is the
primary source for the information
now social media is not considered
trustworthy because it is in public
opinion
but their friend's opinion as a result
this type of data can be classified as a
traditional selection bias easily
accessible but not for unrepresentative
and specific subsets of the overall
population
the next type of bias is the
self-selection bias
self-selection bias occurs
when the respondents are allowed to
decide entirely for themselves whether
they want to participate in the survey
or not
the reasons for this error may be same
that the data may be collected
which are easily available
let's try to understand this type of
bias with the help of an example
suppose you want to assess a program for
improving the eating habits or the shift
workers
you put up posters where many workers
night shifts and invite them to
participate
however
those who sign up may be different from
those who don't
they may be more health conscious to be
with which is why they are interested in
a program to improving eating habits
if this was the case it wouldn't be fair
to conclude that the program was
effective or not
in this case a selection bias occurs
recall bias
recall bias occurs when respondents
recollection of events is inaccurate or
incomplete
it's especially problematic when it
comes to retrospective service question
for example
suppose you're asked for a football
match that happened three years back now
you may remember the goals and the
good moments of the football match and
but might not be able to recall the bad
moments or the false all the mistakes
that happened in that match
so if you try to guess work here in this
case i recall bias can occur
otherwise the observer bias
when a researcher subconsciously project
their expectation onto the research this
is known as the observer bias
in this case the beliefs or expectation
of an observer can influence the data
that is collected for the study
let's try to understand this observer
bias with the help of an example
suppose is a certain news channel
now in the race of trp certain news
might not be accurate or maybe even
false but to prove his point he may try
to prove that this news is correct and
the data that are given are accurate in
this case the observer which is a news
channel is trying to force its opinion
on the data and in this case the
observed bias can occur
so with this we have discussed all the
types of biases with the help of an
example

with the basics of excel introduction to
Excel and the various professionals
using Excel and the perks of using Excel
in your job fields we shall proceed with
this Excel Basics fill course now over
to our training experts the predictive
discussion
so the agenda for today's discussion is
first we will understand what exactly is
Microsoft Excel followed by that we will
understand the fundamentals of Microsoft
Excel the tools available in Excel how
to create a new sheet etc etc followed
by that we will enter the last part of
today's session where we will have a
demo inventory of Microsoft Excel where
I'll explain the fundamentals of
Microsoft Excel in a practical way I
hope I made myself clear with the agenda
now let's get started with the first
point that is what is Microsoft Excel so
Microsoft Excel is a software product
designed and developed by Microsoft
store in data in an organized way that
is rows and columns and Microsoft Excel
is also capable to manipulate data
through some mathematical operations
followed by that
Microsoft Excel is also used to extract
the insights from the data and represent
it in the form of visually appealing
graphs and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel
so following guards and fundamentals
that you need to know before getting
started with Microsoft Excel so
basically when you install the Microsoft
Office in your computer you will have
various Microsoft products out of which
Microsoft Excel is one of the product so
we will be dealing exactly with that
particular product that is Microsoft
Excel so when you get started with
Microsoft Excel this is what you will
see in the first page so this particular
page is called as Microsoft Excel home
page where you will be having various
varieties of sheets Microsoft Excel will
give you some suggestions based on the
type of sheet you want to work with we
will see this in a better way through
the Practical session so once you get
started with the sheet you will have
some more options so this particular
option is called as the toolbar menu you
will have the file home insert raw paste
layout formulas data review View and
help so these are the tools that you
will be using to work on your data using
Microsoft Excel furthermore we have a
toolbar ribbon so when you select sum or
the other option from the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help buttons you will
have a ribbon so for example you can see
that I have selected the Home Tool here
so when I press on the Home Tool this is
the ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives
me so this ribbon has some options in it
which can perform various operations now
in a further a more detailed way we will
have toolbar groups so when you see in
the previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the phone bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions
so each set is called as a group
and I think you can see a small Arrow
option over here so this Arrow option is
used into the toolbar groups when the
group is not able to fit all the
operations or all the functionalities in
one single provided section so when you
click on this particular Arrow Mark you
will have another dialog box so this is
called toolbar more options so you can
see that when I clicked on this icon you
can see a new dialog box which opens me
a new set of operations which are not
able to be fit in this particular group
so we will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the room
name
and apart from that you can have the
sheet tracker in the bottom left corner
of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets
and in the bottom right corner you have
an option of increasing or decreasing
the sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
so now we enter the demo inventory in
Microsoft Excel so we will be using
Microsoft Excel to create a sheet of the
employees in a company
so basically an employee in a company
has employee ID name and designation
salary etc etc so we will be trying to
create the same table using Microsoft
Excel but before that let us understand
the fundamentals of Microsoft Excel
through the Practical demo first so I
have started my Microsoft Excel and this
is how the home page of Microsoft Excel
looks like so you have a blank workbook
over here if you want to create a new
workbook you can select new Option so
Excel will provide you with various
variety of sheets you can see money in
Excel adjustable meeting agenda
streaming show list small business cash
flow and many more if you're not able to
find what you're looking for then you
always have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal if
it's planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of sheets
so you can see that Excel has provided
us with some online varieties of sheets
for example any calendar business
expenses Channel marketing budget budget
summary report blue product list etc etc
you can see construction proposal
invoice your name Excel has got it so
Excel will provide you with some variety
of options based on your requirement now
for this session let's get started with
a blank workbook which looks something
like this since this tutorial is based
on the fundamentals we'll go with the
blank workbook
now over here you can see the toolbar
that we discussed earlier that has the
file home insert draw paste layout
formulas data review View and help so
this is the toolbar and under the
toolbar I have selected home and you can
see this is the particular ribbon what
we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to home page and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some FX to
the text font size and font style etc
etc apart from this we have also
discussed about the cells in every sheet
so this particular cell has an address
so you can see the address over here
which is B3 so B happens to be the
column name and three happens to be the
row name now we also had a discussion
about the sheet tracker right now we
just have one sheet if you want multiple
sheets you can just feel free to select
on the plus option which will always
create you some extra sheets
and you can navigate through sheets just
by pressing on the sheet name
and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with hundred percent
now these are the few fundamentals that
you need to keep in mind before getting
started with Microsoft Excel now that we
know the fundamentals of Microsoft Excel
let's get started with a practical
session which is about the employees
details in a company
now let's select this particular cell
and let's type in employee details
yeah we have the cell
now an employee details table will have
the information related to employees so
the information will be about name
it will be about employee number
it will be the designation
and maybe salary
and maybe blood group as well
and let's take another one which is
phone number
here
foreign so good
and you can see that we have some
problem with this particular column the
designation and the name uh the name of
the designation is practically good but
it is not visible so when you uh when
you're not on that particular cell you
can see that the name is incomplete over
here so you can always fix that you can
just you know manually change the size
of the row or cell or you can also feel
free to you know double click on that
cell which will automatically you know
set the size of that particular cell and
same goes to the blood group just let's
try to double click on that and same
goes to phone number
great
so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them
you can just select this one which will
help you with merging and centering that
particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it
now let's get started by adding the
names of the employees
let's add the names Joe
John
uh Mary mark
Susan
and then
Jennifer
let's open mic
let's open them
chef
Jeffrey
yeah we have a couple of employees now
let's type in the employee numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
now we are on the Excel spreadsheet
now here we have some sales data based
on a store now what we are going to do
is we are going to add some multiple
rows or a single Row in this particular
data so here you can see the region wise
category wise statewise sub category
wise and there are sales and quantities
right now let us imagine that you must
start to add a sale data here right so
let us imagine that on the row seventh
you are supposed to add some detail for
example some technology related sale
happen on that day and you missed out to
add it right so how do you create a new
row now
so for example if multiple sales
happened on the same day like three to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option insert now this
will insert one single row if you wanted
to add one single row or a tuple and if
you wanted to add multiple rows for
example you wanted to add three rows
altogether then it's also simple all you
have to do is select three rows
and right click and press on insert and
then you have three rows so there you go
so that's how you add multiple rows in a
Excel spreadsheet or that's how you add
one single Row in an Excel spreadsheet
now on my spreadsheet you can see some
data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is North West South East so
you can you know make things look better
by hiding these columns and if you hide
these columns it's critical for the end
user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select the columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group g h i j columns
and there you go now similarly let's
also try to group the rows of North
and rows of West
foreign
right now all these rows and columns
have been grouped now all you can do is
just click on the minimize button and
those will be minimized similarly the
rows right
and to unhide them all you can do is
click on the plus icon and they will be
unhidden
you can also try to ungroup the columns
and rows all you have to do is select
the columns and click on the ungroup
option similarly the rows as well
and that's how you can group and ungroup
now comparing two different columns or
multiple columns happens to be an
important job when you're working in
data analytics as you have to come up
with some decisive decisions based on
the data now if you had to do it
manually then you might end up taking
hours or even days based on the data set
you're working with but if I say that
you can do it within minutes then it
would be interesting to work with right
now we'll be doing the same now we'll
work on a sample data set right on my
screen
so here we have column 1 and column two
now our job is to compare the column 1
and column 2 and come up with the result
now the first and the simplest way to do
it is use the built-in condition
formatting which comes with Excel by
default now all you have to do is
select all the data and navigate to home
and in the home go to Styles group and
select conditional formatting and in
conditional formatting you can see
highlight cells so in that you can use
duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplicate cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column one but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for The Unique columns and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like you
can just directly press equal to and
select the cell
and equals to and the next cell press
enter and if there is a match it will
give you true if there is no match then
it will give you false now you can drag
it down and see which all are matching
and which are not
now you can also make some minute
modifications to this
so uh if in case you didn't find the
data then you can say not found so for
that you can try if and inside brackets
and then you can give the value as not
found
if true it's found first you have to
give the True Values so for true you can
write it as found and in case if it's
not found then you can write it on as
not fund
there you go close the bracket press
enter
and there you go if there is a perfect
match you will have found and if there
is no match then you'll get not found
now so far we have discussed comparing
two cells using conditional formatting
and also by using equals to operator and
trying to add some tweaks to the equals
to Operator by involving with if
operator and apart from those we also
have another way to compare two columns
in Excel so another way is using the
lookup functions so we'll use a simple
vlookup function to compare both the
cells so for that let's type in equals
to we look up
space and select the cell you want to
check for and then
the range of elements you want to
compare and then I'll press F4 to log
them
now uh you want the data from column one
and now you want the exact match so 0
press enter
so the elements which are present in
column one and column 2 are been
displayed here so but in case if the
elements are not found you'll get an
error so let's look at that simply drag
the formula to all the cells and there
you go so the elements which are
matching will give you the proper result
but the ones which are not matching will
give you not applicable or error message
this can be fixed we can make some minor
tweaks to the same formula
so we can add if error
comma
simply write an as not found
and close the bracket so that should do
so we have closed the bracket and press
enter there you go now simply drag this
and soon you can see the data which is
having no match is shown as not found
now uh there is another possibility okay
let's get back to another different
sheet so this should work
so uh we already have the formula so
let's erase that first I'll erase the
whole data
and even this one
yeah now we have the clear column four
so here you can see we have for India
and here you can see we have just four
and similarly here you have Mahendra and
Mahendra and here you have Mahendra
right so in some situations you might
have to compare two different columns
but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first cases Oracle and in the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one thing but you have some
minor text changes right just like here
you have Fort India and here you have
four so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to vlookup
and
also the comparison cell which is this
one and we are not you're not stopping
them you're trying to add
the wild card here so the wild card is
asterisk which means if there is
anything like if you get the comparison
between the first cell and the second
cell which matches and if there is
anything extra rather than the actual
cell please try to consider it so that's
what we're going to do so after entering
entering the wild card symbol you'll
select the range of columns which you
have to uh you know fetch the data from
and then try to fix them using function
key F4
you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and enter
now let's try to drag it
there you go
so you have the data Mahindra and
Mahindra
Hyundai India Honda India so that's how
you try to use now without further Ado
let's get started with the Practical
mode now we have started our Excel
worksheet and here you can see we have
Android details on our worksheet now all
of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you're a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so B is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a call next to V then you
want to select the column C and right
click and select the insert option so
that it can be added in between V and C
which is adjacent to V so let's look at
it right so you have added the next
column or a new column right next to the
column V and it's in between the
designation and employee name now you
can add your inner second name so that's
how you create a new column in Excel now
in case if you wanted to you know create
multiple columns all together so here we
have or here we needed a second name
also here you have a designation and you
wanted to add another column which you
know assigns manages to the employees
right so let's delete it uh Delete the
second column and let me explain you how
what I want to do so here you wanted to
add the second name of the employee and
also the manager of these employees
right so here you wanted to add two
columns all together right and now you
might be wondering could I add two
columns together uh or will it work only
for the one column thing right now it
works for two columns and also more than
two columns all together so you wanted
to add two columns here right so select
the two columns you can you can select
or you can click on the column C and
hold that left key and drag it along the
right side okay so here I have selected
two columns and here it's three right so
you can see here uh it's one zero four
eight five six seven six R cross three
see that means you have selected three
columns if I navigate another four you
can see we have selected four columns
right now right click and select on
insert and you'll have four columns in
between employee name and designation
now you might have to add your second
name manager's name manages employee ID
you know and Department everything or
you can add anything or any number of
columns in between the existing columns
so that's how you add columns in Excel
and with that we have content end of
this session on how to add columns or
how to add multiple columns in Excel
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add two columns in
Excel
so first let us assume that we are
trying to add two columns in Excel which
has textual kind of data this type of
data can be added using the concat
function which is a string concatenation
function in Excel so type in concat
press Tab Key to select the function the
first cell that is A2 and next the
second cell that is V2 separated by
comma press enter and there you go now
you can see we don't have a space so you
can modify the formula
add space
double quotes space double quotes comma
press enter
there you go now you can drag the same
formula across all the cells and you
have it now coming to the last column
where we literally have numbers right so
you can add two different numbers over
here
either you can select the first cell
that is D2 plus E2 and press enter and
you get the number or you can use the
sum function
tap to select and
one
two press enter
or another simplest way is select all
the blank output cells so these are the
cells where you are expecting an output
of two cells that is column entire
column B and entire column e right now
after selecting the blank cells of f
column or the resultant column press the
shortcut key that is alt equals to
so this is the shortcut method to call
the sum function and assign the cell
values of individual columns that is d
and e and get the resultant cell in F
column right so remember the shortcut
key that is alt e now you can see I'm on
my Excel worksheet and I have one table
on my worksheet right now so you can you
know transposing or you know converting
rows to columns is a very simple task
I'll explain you in two different ways
so the first way select all the cells
that you have on your sheet and press on
Ctrl C so it will give you the copy
option and then you can also paste in
the same sheet or if you want you can go
to a whole new sheet and select the
paste option over here but before
selecting the actual paste option you
can see a small drop down icon click on
that and navigate to paste special and
in this you can see transpose option
click on that or you know make sure that
it's checked and press ok now you can
see all your columns have been converted
into rows and all your rows are
converted into columns so this was the
first way and what as the second where
you ask me so it's really simple select
one cell somewhere
and you know you can or let's create a
new sheet as well so here you can you
know write down the formula as transpose
and select the array which you want to
transpose so this is the array
so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data
press enter there you go so all your
rows are now columns and all your
columns are now the rows that is how to
convert cells from low case to uppercase
in Excel now let's get back to the
Practical mode and now we are on our
Excel spreadsheet so here we have some
text boxes on the column A and on column
V we have lower and upper okay so we
have a mix of uppercase and low keys in
our text so first we'll try to convert
them to lowercase and then we'll try to
convert the entire text into uppercase
so for that you need to press on equal
symbol and select the lower formula
attack and you selected the function and
now click on the cell A3 that's your
cell address and press on ok now all the
letters are converted to low case so we
had J in the uppercase which is
converted to lowercase now all you can
do is drag the formula to all the cells
and it will be applied to all the cells
right now let's similarly try to convert
into uppercase and tap space and there
you go you have selected the formula now
the cell address
press enter
and drag the same address I mean drag
the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you convert the cells or data in Excel
to uppercase or lowercase in Excel we
have already learned some basic
operations which you can do in Excel and
let's Implement our knowledge by working
on this particular data which is coming
in from housing data set now here if we
see some fields we have agent date
listed area list price and this is
basically the data which has been sorted
in newest to oldest order of date listed
so how do we
arrive at this so what I can do is I can
just click on data listed and then I can
either go in here I can select sort I
can get into custom sort and then I can
choose the column based on which I would
want to sort the data so I would look
for the newest data to the oldest data
that means that would mean a descending
order of dates or you could say the
oldest state or the earliest month will
be towards the lower side of your sheet
so here we can select date listed now I
can say let it sort based on Cell values
and the order what we have here so we
have newest to oldest so let's select
this I can say OK and now if you see the
date has been sorted so we have your
10 18 2007 on the top so that seems to
be the latest date and as we go down we
will see an earlier month hour and
earlier month than that in the state
listed so we have sorted our data into
newest to oldest order and that's based
on your date column so the result shows
up here now what we can also do is we
can have different questions which we
would want to answer so for example I
would want to sort the data in ascending
order of area and descending order of
agent name how do we do that so let's
look into this so this is here I already
have the result here and how did I get
this so I'm looking for ascending order
of area and descending order of agent
name so we can start with any particular
column that does not matter so for
example if I look into this Excel sheet
I have my agent name select this which
we want in a descending order so we
could either do a sort and then go for
descending sort Z to A we could also use
the filter option here on the top right
and we could do it or I could just say
sort Z to A and then it has arranged the
data based on the agent column being in
descending order now I can go into area
and then I can again do a sort and I
wanted my area column to be used for
sorting the data and ascending to
descending and that basically not only
changes the order of this particular
column but for my complete data so let's
do that and now if you see we have the
data which has been sorted so we can see
how many values we have here and the
area values which we see and this is how
you get your result so I'll just do a
control Z and again and I'm back to my
original data and this is the sorted
result which we are seeing at similarly
we can answer other questions for
example sort the data according to the
following order of area that is we are
saying counties
Central and then your county so we can
basically choose in which particular way
we would want to do it so it is County
Central and then again County so if I
look into my sheet 3 so here I basically
have my data which is having some South
County then you have your Central and
then you have your North County so we
would want to sort the data to solar
problem which is according to the
following order so first we go for area
then we go for South County Central and
North County so what we can do is we can
basically have area field selected and I
would want to sort this particular data
so I have South County Central and North
County so I can basically go for custom
sort
and then I can choose which is the value
or column which I'm interested in let's
go for area
we will go for something like cell
values well you can also try to explore
conditional formatting icon if this is
what you would want to use or we can
basically go for just cell values and
here we can say if I would be interested
in first getting my values for South
County so for example I can say custom
list and then I can basically given the
new list here so I can say s
Dot County
and then I would want Central and then I
would want North County
so let's select this
as it exists we can basically say add
and that's basically the order which we
want to say okay and then say okay here
and now what we would want is we would
want our data so we can compare that
with the values which we see here it
starts with Kelly you have in the 12th
row something like Lang and that's what
we are doing so we can basically arrange
the data in a particular order by
choosing a custom list and then sorting
your data so that's one more simpler
task what we have done where we have
sorted the data in the order where
under our area column we first wanted
South County then we wanted Central data
and then we wanted North County so this
is how you can do it now let's look into
one more problem so it says find all the
houses in the central area and we would
want to basically apply a regular filter
let's let's see how do we do that so we
can click on this and here we have the
data so the problem statement is we
would want to find all the houses in
Central Area now how do we do that we
can do a sorting but we would want to
use the filter which you see here is
implemented so how do you do it so you
can select this area and say for example
I would want to apply filter I can just
go in here and I can say let's get a
filter on my first row and now I have
filters applied so we are interested in
looking into the Central Area houses
let's go in here it says all these
fields are selected that means it shows
everything wherein your area has all
these values let's unselect this and
then I will only be interested in the
central so let's say okay and then say
okay so now you see that the area filter
has been applied and we are looking at
the central column so what we have done
is we have applied a simple filter and
we are looking at our data at any point
of time if you do not want the filter
then what I can do is I can select this
and I can say well I'm interested in all
the data so I could do this or you can
clear the filters from area and you get
your data back so that's in one way you
can filter out your data so let's look
at an example of sort and filter where
we might have to filter the data based
on two columns or multiple columns with
different kind of values where it could
be and and or condition now say for
example this is the data I have and this
is the question which we need to answer
such as find the list of all houses in
the central region with pool and South
County without pool now if it was a
simple filter based on one cell I could
have just selected my header row I could
have then applied the filter
and once I have the filter I can look in
area where I have three regions so I'm
only interested in Central and South
County so I can get rid of North County
and that's fine but then we have two
different conditions here so we need the
data in central region to have the value
for pool being true
and for South County the value has to be
without pool now how do we do that so
what we can do is we can first create a
copy of these headers here so let me do
that now the area has to be South County
so basically I can either just select
this and I can choose this value
and then I can select this and then I
can choose Central so that's the
criteria which I have and the pool value
has to be so central region should be
with pool so then this one
basically has to be true
and this one has to be basically false
so south county is without pool so let's
select one of the values here and this
is my criteria now to get my result uh
we can always place your cursor here and
you can check this is M column and
eighth row okay so we would want the
result here so let's go ahead and now
click on data and then in filter you
have an option called Advanced and here
what I can do is I can say I would want
to filter the list in the place but
that's not what I would want to do so
I'll say copy to another location and
here if you see the list range will tell
me that this is the data so A1 to J 126
so a to J column selected and all the
rows criteria range is basically based
on what I have given here so that is m
from 1
to V which is 3
so I am selecting these columns and then
I am saying all the way whatever
criteria I have given and copy 2 I am
saying M8
2 V8 so that basically will give me my
filtered result so you could basically
just say okay and now I have my data
which has been filtered and I have my
area which is South County that is
without Pool Central with pool again
South County without pool and then if
you look at your central value that's
pool so this is an advanced filter which
we have applied where simply we have
filtered the data based on two columns
and then we have our result so in this
way you can have your customized filter
applied on two different columns and get
your data which can be either replacing
the existing content or in the same
sheet in different set of columns and
rows you can have your result let's look
at one more example of filtering where
you are trying to filter the data based
on a and condition condition being met
in two different columns and then you
would want to filter out the data for
only specific columns so the situation
is the agents with a house in North
County that should be County area having
two and a single type family so we are
talking about two bedrooms and we would
basically have a single type family and
here the criteria is that if we would
want to only populate these columns
which is Agent area bedroom and type now
what you can do is as I explained
earlier that you can get your result in
the same sheet in a different location
so here I have created these headers
which says agent area bedrooms and type
now this is basically a copy of all the
columns what we have here agent data
listed area list Place bedrooms bath
square feet and so on so you can
basically create a copy of the headers
here and this is where we will give our
Advanced criteria to filter the data so
the conditions which need to be met is
we need to look at North County so for
example here in area I can basically go
ahead and select one of the values North
County now the criteria is having two
bedrooms only so let's say bedrooms and
let's say the value should be 2
and then basically I am saying a single
type family so when you would want the
single type family so here under type I
can give the criteria single type so
this is my and condition so we are
saying North County area having two
bedrooms and the type is single family
now this is the criteria which basically
means if I select this this one tells me
that this is m one row onwards till V
2 so this is what we have and we would
want to filter based on this so let's go
ahead and then go for data filter
Advanced and here in advanced it says
filter the list in place now that's not
what we would want to do so I'll say
copy to another location this basically
selects the list range so which is
telling me A1
2 J 126 so that's the
columns and rows selected criteria range
is based on M1 V2 which we have given
here and copy to I would say for example
from M7
to
p7 now this is the area where I would
this is the place where I want the
result let's say okay and now I get my
data which is based on the question
which has been asked that you would want
the agents with a house in North County
area having two bedrooms and single type
family so in this way you can basically
do Advanced filtering get your data and
get it stored in the sheet anywhere at a
different location well I could have
also done filtering in place and that
would have replaced the data
which we have but that's not what we
want we would want the filtered result
in a different place so this is how you
can do some Advanced filtering we can
also use Excel to filter out the data in
one particular column which might be
conditional or say using some numerical
filters now here say for example the
problem statement is that you would want
to display all the houses whose list
price is between
45
000 to 600 000 or say for example we
would want to filter out the data to
something else say for example let's say
I have I would want to filter out the
data between 300
000 and 400 000 so we can basically
update this
say for example I am saying I'm
interested in 300
thousand
two
to four hundred
thousand and that's the criteria to
filter out the data now there are two
different ways or there are two easier
ways to do it one is I would want to
look at the list price so I can select
this I can go ahead and do a filter here
and in the list price now this is where
we would want to do the filtering so
it's pretty easy you can click on this
one and then you can go into number
filters and you can choose between now
that's one easier way of doing it so I
could basically select this I could say
I'm looking for Value which is greater
than or equal to three hundred thousand
and then is less than or equal to 400
000 so if I just do this I have applied
my filter and I have my data which is
filtered based on my criteria right so
that's one easier way of doing it or let
me do a control Z
now let the filter be there which you
can anyways use but what we can also do
is as we have seen earlier methods so
get a
set or get your column headers here
and then you are giving two columns here
now the only difference between
my
this set of columns which I have one two
three four and then you have seven and
ten columns and if you see here we have
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven right so whenever you want a and
condition you will basically
add the columns where I can give add
condition if it is the same column if it
was a different column then it would be
same number of columns but and
conditions will lie in the same line and
or condition would lie in a different
line now here I can give this value so I
am looking for listed price being
between three hundred thousand so I am
saying it should be greater than or
equal to three hundred thousand and then
I can say less than or equal to 400 000
now that's my criteria and then I need
my result here which is in M 7 so what I
can do is once I have given my criteria
which I'll be using to filter I can get
into Data I can get into advanced and
then I can say copy to another location
so it is selecting my A1 to J 126
criteria range is based on M1 to W 2 and
then I would want my result from this
particular column so let's say okay and
now you have your data filtered out in a
different location in the sheet which
has been filtered based on your and
condition so you can filter out the data
in this way or you could just apply a
filter on a column and give the
conditions
now let's solve one more interesting
problem and here we would want to use
Excel where we would have an and and an
or condition so say for example this is
the data given to you and the question
is that you would want to find all the
houses in North County again that's a
spelling mistake but then they are North
County area with a list price greater
than 300 000 and having three or four
bedrooms so the bedroom has conditional
so it has R 3 and 4 and then basically
you have list price which is greater
than three hundred thousand now I could
have obviously selected The Columns and
then basically gone for a filter so I
can just do a filtering here and then
I'm looking for list price being greater
than 300 000 so which we can always give
a number filter and I can say great
greater than and then I can say greater
than or equal so I can say greater than
and then I can give 3030 300 000 and
that's basically the filter which we
would want and here I would want to
select the bedrooms which should be just
either three or four so if for example
here I go in here and I unselect this
and then I say 3 and 4 right so I am
getting my data which is greater than
300 000 and it should have the bettering
values which will be either 3 or 4
selected now that's one way of doing it
let's do a control Z and get it back
2 as we were or you can even just say
clear filter so you get your data back
as it was so what we can do is we can
hear
give the criteria
so for example I have my list price now
this is what I would want as a condition
so let's say greater than
three hundred thousand
300 000 and bedrooms should be three
and then I can say greater than three
hundred thousand
and then I can say four so this one
basically gives me a situation where
your list price has to be greater than
three hundred thousand and bedroom
should be either three or four so we
have given our filtering criteria now to
get the result what we can do is we can
go into Data we can go into advanced and
we can say copy to another location so
our list range is selected which is
columns a to J row number 1 to 126 your
criteria range is given in M1 to V3
where we have specified and we are
saying the result would be in M 7 to E7
so if I do this now I have got the same
data which we were seeing earlier and
here the bedroom values are three or
four and basically the list price is
greater than three hundred thousand so
this is a simpler way in which you can
create your filters and all this
Advanced filtering what we are seeing it
will be saved with your sheet you can
always go back and change this value or
you could do filtering where one person
has to look into the filter to see what
values have been having said that if you

below how to modify or increase cell
size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the sales
error here just to increase the
visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by hovering over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either of these options will
help you to maximize or minimize your
column width
similarly you can apply the same idea
for your rows as well so you can either
format the cells or modify the row
height of your cell and this is another
way and another simple way is to just
hold that line and drag it so it
improves your width of the column and
another way is to just hover onto that
line and hold it and drag it to
improvise or increase your width of the
cell and SEMA plus to your rope so this
is another way so apart from that there
is another way that is format cells from
this particular option in the home
button you can select this and here you
have the row height out of it row height
column width auto fit column width for
example let us imagine that you wanted
to you know just by mistake you uh you
increase the cell size and you want it
to restore it back to the original thing
right so you can just click on the
autofit height and click on the order
fit called width then you go it happens
in that way and now coming back to
another
simplest way let us imagine that you are
given a lot of data and you are told to
go to fit all the rows and columns now
we have already seen the format cell
option where I will Auto fetch all the
columns and width of the column and also
the height of the rows Etc right but
there is also a keyboard shortcut to do
this so all you have to do is select a
cell and press Ctrl a to select all the
cells in the spreadsheet and once all
the cells are selected all you have to
do is press and hold ALT key and then
release it then the combination of keys
that is h o i
so your column width has been now
adjusted now the same formula or the
same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or
autofit all the cells in Excel with that
we have come to an end of this session
on how to modify or increase the cell
size in Excel if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session how to add date and Excel
spreadsheet now there are multiple ways
to add date to Excel spreadsheet for
example equals to today this is a
shortcut method and you can enter
done you will have to list it but again
there is some problem with this kind of
approach so today's state is 4th of
September 2022. now if we open the same
spreadsheet after today that is tomorrow
or day after tomorrow then you will have
a concurrent date that is 5th of
September or 6th of September right the
date will always vary or get updated
according to time now you don't want to
change that or you don't want that to be
happening with employ state of joining
right it should be stagnant it should
not vary right so there is another
shortcut way apart from using the
daytime functions there is a keyboard
shortcut where you can add day to excel
that is control semicolon so this is the
shortcut way to add date to your Excel
spreadsheet and this particular date
will not change this will remain the
same constant date throughout the time
now there is a chance where you might
also have to add time to your
spreadsheet that is date of joining and
time of joining right so there is
another simple shortcut where you can
add
Time by just pressing three keys that is
holding Ctrl holding shift and pressing
semicolon then you'll have the time so
this is how you can add date to your
Excel spreadsheet and add time to your
Excel spreadsheet and this date and time
will remain constant it will not vary
like the 3D function that we have used
here now we are on our Excel spreadsheet
now you might want to you know add some
extension to your data since we have
sales here you might want to add the
dollar logo right so if you have like 5
to 10 rows then it's easy but if you
have multiple rows then it might be a
little time consuming in such scenarios
you might want to select the entire
column right so how do you do that in a
shortest method so there are multiple
methods to do it so the easiest one the
first and the easiest one is clicking on
the column number or column name so here
we have the column name that is e and if
you click on it the entire column is
selected and here we have numbers so let
us imagine that you wanted to select the
row number two click on number two and
you have all the rows I mean the entire
row selected all the cells are selected
right so this is one way and again
there is another way where you can just
you know click on the first table header
and press Ctrl spacebar so the
combination key is control spacebar for
columns and if you want to select the
entire row it is shift spacebar so this
is the method two and another method so
you might have a doubt here right so
when you click on the column name or
when you click on the row number the
entire row or entire column gets
selected right and you wanted to select
only the cells which have data so we
have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well Ctrl shift
right arrow key or left Arrow key based
on your rows and all the rows with data
will be selected I mean all the cells in
a row are selected not the entire row
and coming back to the first question
that is adding the dollar symbol so here
we have General so go to the data type
and add currency
so you have rupees here so currently we
are in India so we have rupees now what
is the advantage of selecting the entire
row when you don't have any data and the
57th row or the next cell right
I'll show you now let us add the number
100 and press enter there you go let us
add another number like thousand and
press enter so the data formatting is
automatically applied to all the cells
so most of the time your cells or the
data sheet will be varying you might
have to add or remove elements or
numbers right so in such scenarios this
will be helpful so you can see that I've
got some data which is first name of the
employee last name of the employee and
phone number and let us assume that your
manager has given you a task to identify
all those employees which did not give
and
phone number so you wanted to identify
them using a check box right
like you will be providing a check for
all the employees that we have received
the phone numbers and you will not be
checking the employees which did not
give the phone number right so let's try
to do that so to include a checkbox you
might want to get into the developer
option but for few reasons Microsoft has
disabled developer option by default to
enable developer option all you have to
do is just navigate anywhere on the
ribbon here and right click and then you
can see customize the ribbon option when
you click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side
right this one so by default you can see
that your developer option is not
enabled to enable it you have to check
in it and there you go you have it now
so press OK and you will have the
developer option now go to the developer
option and select the insert option and
there you can see the check box now draw
the checkbox anywhere
I'll try it over here and there you go
you have the first check box right now
if you want you can even customize this
so carefully click it
you can edit the text
and write it as
done
okay
now you can even copy this to all the
cells
just select and drag and there you go
now you can go ahead and check all the
employees which you have received the
phone numbers
and you can eliminate the ones which did
not provide you with phone numbers
that's how you can do it
and there's also another option where
you can use this to include it in a
formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manually check in the data and you
can leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example if this
particular box is checked then you will
get a True Value here and if it's not
checked you will have a false value then
you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to implement
that
you can right click the cell and you can
find format control
then you can see here
you have an option called cell link here
select the cell link
and press ok
so here you can see if you have checked
this the value is true and if you
uncheck this
you can see the value turned false now
you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get it against that option
and you can see a really available
checkbox you don't have to use any
developer options over here
and there you go you can just check and
uncheck it
now here on my sheet you can see we have
some numbers that is ten dollars or ten
point two zero dollars twenty two
dollars fifty three point one two
dollars twelve dollars and hundred and
ten dollars now the task is to convert
these numbers into word format that is
representing the numbers alphabetically
right this might be a little curious and
we also might end up searching for a
predefined method which is not readily
available in Excel but there is a way
where you can create a function using
Excel VBA or macros now again creating a
macro is completely complex now
identifying the trouble Microsoft has
already come up with a readily available
macro code on their official website
which will support the various versions
of Microsoft Excel starting from
Microsoft Excel 365 to all the way up to
the older Excel version that is 2010.
now you can scroll down and use this
particular macro function which
Microsoft has readily made us available
and use this to create our own macro in
Excel VBA now let's get back to Excel
and you can create a macro using the
developer option now developer options
will not be readily available in
Microsoft Excel to activate developer
option go to home and go to the options
menu in the last
and here go to customize ribbon and here
in the second drop down menu you can see
developer option by default it will not
be checked click on the check option to
activate developer options and press ok
now you have your developer options
ready click on developer options click
on Visual Basic and here to insert a new
macro click on the insert button click
on module and a new macro window is
readily available for you now Ctrl V to
paste your code and your function is
with the name number to text right now
close the macro
and here your function will be readily
available
equals to and the function name was
number to text press tab to select the
function and select the cell where you
have the data close the function press
enter now drag the same formula across
all the cells and here you have the text
converted from numbers so here we have
ten dollars twenty cents and you have
ten dollars twenty cents twenty two
dollars and no sense 53 dollars and
twelve cents twelve dollars and no cents
and hundred and ten dollars with no
sense now that's how you can convert
numbers to words using the macro which
is predefined for excel in the Microsoft
website get back to the Practical mode
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the rate of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated IF function or if you also
call it as date diff function based on
your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff in
Excel for further information that video
will be linked in the description box
below you can go through it or you can
use the end screens and icons linked to
this video to get back to the tutorial
based on date diff in Excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these date of births
so all you have to do is type equals to
and type dated if
and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a two day function in Excel press
on tap to select it and give a close
bracket now comma and if you wanted to
calculate the age in terms of days you
have to uh you know give d as the input
yeah here it should be D as the input
and don't forget to use the double
quotes here and if you use the single
course there might be an error so use
double quotes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months you can give months for now
we want an ESO we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the H here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel now on my spreadsheet you can
see some employee data so they've been
assigned a task and they want to update
the task status as done and not done
using symbolic statements that is tick
mark and into mugs now how to do that it
is really simple we'll discuss two
different ways the first way is to do it
by conditional formatting so click a
cell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
row yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automate it so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two color scale select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Market have various types of
them you know the circular Tech Market
let's select the generic tick mark
without any outer circles and into here
generic X Mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than 0
it will be green and when the value is
less than or equal to 0 it will be X and
the reference value is 0 and here also
the reference value is 0 everything is
okay click on OK and done
and here you cannot see the logos here
we need to add some formula here which
is equals to F click on Tab to select
the simple and if Cell address C2 is
equals to done
then the value should be 1 else the
value should be 0 close the bracket
enter
right now you can see this particular
logo here now drag the same formula it's
done now you can see we do have numbers
you can eliminate those numbers as well
just edit the rules
and here you can see show icon only
click OK and the numbers will be removed
also I did the second one and there you
go the numbers are gone and only the
symbols remain now what is the second
technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know going into
the options here go to file and here go
to options and here go to Advanced
customize weapon and in here on the
right hand side you will get developer
options click on the tick box and it
will be enabled now go into developer
options and click into insert menu click
on the form controls or active X
controls select the check box and now
just place it over here you know you can
edit this particular checkbox delete
everything drag it as checkbox as well
now you can drag the same cell across
all the functions and you will have the
check box as well now you can click on
it and say if it's done or not now we
have started our Microsoft Excel and
here we have our MD worksheet so dated
IF function is majorly used to find the
differences between two individual dates
so it is also called as dated F by a few
people and a few people also reference
it to date diff that is State difference
so anything is good now to find the
difference between any two dates let's
select a few dates so the first date
would be let us imagine that you're an
employee and you wanted to find out how
many errors that you've been working
with an organization so for that you
might want to need it today and the date
where you join the company right so it
might be native joining and and today
so what's the difference
right so let us imagine that you joined
the organization somewhere around 2010
0 1
zero five
2010
and
today so for today I can you can give
any particular date
let us imagine that uh today is first of
January 2021 or 2022
now we have up both the date status the
joining date and the current date which
can be the current date so that there
can be anything so you might be watching
this on a different date as well so the
date of that day for today would be a
little different so we'll imagine that
today's date as an imaginary date now we
might want to find the different status
in terms of years
so you wanted to find the difference in
terms of years so here you can find the
difference in terms of Errors days and
months as well so currently let's try to
find out the difference in terms of
years so for years you might want to
specify the third parameter in the
dative function as y if you wanted once
you have to give the M as the third
parameter and if you wanted to find the
days you might want to give d as the
third parameter so we have discussed the
third parameter so what are the first
two parameters right so the first two
parameters are the first date and the
last date so the first date in this
situation is your date of joining and
the last date or the final date which
you want here as your today so let's
find the difference so for that equals
to
so it can be dated F or date div
ided if and the first date which is the
A2 and comma the last state that is P2
and your parameter third parameter in
terms of year status Y close the bracket
and press enter so there you go you have
your date here so it's been like 11
years that you're working with your
organization so that's how you find out
the differences so we have 11 years
because we did not finish the 12th year
completely so if we had given the month
as maybe six
where we have finished our total years
then it will automatically change to 12
years
so that's how you work with dated F
function in Excel back to the Practical
mode so you can see on my screen we are
on the Excel spreadsheet and on my
spreadsheet you can see date in column A
and A different formats n column C D E
and F respectively Now by default the
data type or the data present in the a
column will be considered as general and
there are a few situations where even if
you try to format the date in your
format like you know the customized
format you may not be able to do it
because it's still under the general
data type so for that for being on the
safer side what we will do is select the
data and navigate to the data toolbar
and in that you have the text to columns
option press that and remember to have
the delimited icon you know you might be
having the dash as your icon or slash as
your icon for the delimited thing and
select that and next next and here you
can see right it's in general mode so
you can press on date and DMI will be a
date format that is date month and year
now click on finish so it's been
formatted now now let's copy the same
data and paste it and all the four
formats so that will see the different
formats that we can change to or
customize to
right
so there you go let's expand the columns
a little bit now we have day month and
year
so now you might want to change a couple
of things right for example you wanted
to change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the cells and right
click and select the format sales option
and in here you can see the date
function and then here you can see
different types of modifications that
you can do to your data right so
you might want to also change your date
based on the location so right now we
are in India and imagine if you wanted
to you know change something based on us
or if you have if you're having your
client in us and he wants the dates and
US format you can also change that so
here you can see English United States
and press on that press OK and you can
see it's been changed to us format where
you have EOS in the first place months
in the second place and dates in the
last place right and now let us imagine
that your client does not want the dates
all he needs is just months right you
can also do that get back to the format
sales option go to custom and here
instead of uh you know a month date and
year all you can do is just write down
month and year and select ok so you'll
have only month and your not the dates
now your client is being a little more
you know he wants a little more detail
and he wants you to add a lot of
granularity to your data which includes
day time Etc everything right so you can
also do that so the same way go to
format sales custom and here I think
it's in date itself
so
let's navigate a little
yeah here so you have the day date month
and year press ok so there you go right
so that's how you can do it
and now let's try a little bit more
if we have a few more options pending
so go to format cells
and Custom
and you also have
timings
so here you have date month year and
timings press OK and there we have all
the timings as well so since these dates
are you know I created them just a few
moments ago to keep it simple so I did
not have to add the timings here so if
you are Keen about adding the timings
you can also do that for example if you
wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and look that you
can also do that using the same format
now you can see that we have the First
Column that is a column and the first
set of that is text and all the other
cells are numbers but as a whole Excel
considers the whole column as a general
data format so why have we discussing
about this so to create a barcode in
Excel you have to make sure that all the
elements in the column are of Text data
type so the first step is to convert
this General data type to Text data type
so you can do that by going into the
data type and selecting text and now all
the elements in your first column A are
type text
now the next step is to convert these
elements into barcode now for that let's
create a new column called barcode
now our new column that is barcode has
been created now the next step would be
is to check for the barcode font so the
barcode font looks something like this
but let me remind you the barcode found
in Excel is not available by default
don't worry if it's not available we can
download it from open source so let's go
back to Google
so on the Google you want to search for
barcode font for Excel so the one that I
would recommend is three of nine barcode
font
now you can download this font by just
clicking on the download button over
here now I've already downloaded this
font on my local system let's now try to
install that
now the three of nine barcode folder
will come in the form of zip folder you
have to unzip that
and after unzipping you will get the
setup file which looks something like
this which is three of nine new select
that and you'll be having the installer
file over here you can install by
selecting the install button over here
so I have already installed it in my
local system so it is readily available
for me on my Microsoft Excel now we
might want to create the barcode for
this particular cell in A2 so let's
create that so to create a barcode we
need to write in a formula that is
equals to double quotes
star
double quotes and Ampersand symbol
address of the cell that is A2 another
Ampersand symbol again double quotes
star symbol and double quotes
so you can either use this or instead of
star you can use brackets as well
so let's try brackets
now select enter
now this will generate another type of
code in your resultant cell now we will
change the font for this particular
resultant cell and we will get our
barcode now you can just drag all these
cells so that you can apply the formula
to all the codes and I got all the codes
over here
now select all the cells get into the
fonts and here select the barcode font
and there you go you have the barcode
for all the numbers you have in your
column A so that's how you create
barcode in Excel spreadsheet and this
spreadsheet has some values of employees
that is their employee ID name
designation Department salary date of
birth and date of churning
now our concern is to highlight some
cells which are duplicate in this or
some rows which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on row number
seven we have the details of Martha
and you can see the same details of
Martha in the row number 14 as well
right so you need to eliminate those
cells or you need to eliminate those
rows now you can say there is a quick
way just few clicks and those will be
eliminated that is conditional
formatting yes that is also one way but
I'll show you what's the problem with
that okay so let us select the entire
table and get into conditional
formatting and here you have duplicate
values highlight cell rules where
duplicate values
and there you go the problem so here we
have designation which is duplicated in
certain ways department and salary state
of joining right so there are certain
conditions or scenarios where you cannot
directly identify which is the duplicate
rule again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the entire
column of employee ID and you can
identify the duplicate cells here since
the employee IDs are unique for everyone
so this is a way but let's dig a little
deeper and understand the way of
highlighting duplicates with an advanced
technique so let me cancel this and for
that let's create a new uh column
and let's name this as duplicate
flag
e flag
so the new column has been created which
is D flag so here we will be using a
simple formula that is
count F and here press tab to select the
formula and here we will be adding our
range that is which range are you
considering so the range will be the
employee ID since employee IDs are
unique for every employee
and
and let's press function F4 to fix it
and now
again the criteria and the criteria will
be the same cell that is A2 and now
close the bracket and press enter
now let's track the same formula to all
the rows
okay now here we have now what you can
do is sort it in an advanced way go to
sort and filter
and custom sort and here you'll be
sorting by the D flag and it will be
smallest to largest
so now you can apply the conditional
formatting to highlight it you can
select the column H or the D flag go to
conditional formatting highlight cell
rules and here you can get into greater
than
and give the value as 1. okay
so all the cells which are you know
repeated multiple times will be selected
here and they will be highlighted with a
selected color what you have given so
I've given Red so now you can select
these cells and I'll let them all delete
them from your spreadsheet
and now all your data in the spreadsheet
is unique and clean so that's how you
highlight duplicate cells in Excel on my
screen you can see some data related to
students now let us try to duplicate
some of the rows here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11. now we shall copy them and paste
them so now these are the duplicate
elements right now there might be
possibilities about the duplication of
class because all the students all the
10 students are in same class so there
might be a duplication but we are not
looking for such kind of duplications
right we are looking for the duplication
of the entire row for example we have
the details of mic over here in the
eighth row which has the roll number of
serial number S7 name as mic roll number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eighth row has been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're gonna
deal with we're gonna eliminate the
duplicate rows all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
the data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remote duplicates option in
the airplane so select all the data
select remove duplicates and now you can
see that we have all our column names
over here and make sure that you have
selected my data as headers and then
select ok
and now you can see that Excel has
automatically removed four duplicate
values so four duplicate values are
found and removed 10 unique values
remain
now another type of remove duplicates
can also be done so you can see that
here we have another data set which has
phone numbers or phone names that is
phone makers that are Samsung Huawei
Vivo Oppo Etc so there are some
duplicate values and this I have copy
pasted it then so now you can also do
that so
just select all the data
and now go into home
and select conditional formatting and
here select highlight cell rules and
inside that you have duplicate values
selecting this option will help you
identify the duplicate values in your
data set but not to remove them so you
can select that and you can see the
duplicate values are highlighted over
here in the red column
now again you can get back to data and
select the option of remove duplicates
and select power key and the duplicate
values will be automatically eliminated
so that's how you delete or eliminate
duplicate values in a data set and you
can also see that we have another
duplicate in this particular row and if
you wanted to select a particular row
and eliminate the duplicate signals to
do that now for that you need to go to
the same process remove duplicates and
here Microsoft Excel is asking you if
you had to expand the selection to the
entire data set or you want to continue
with the selected data set Etc or
selected column itself so for that you
need to select the continue with the
current selection and remove duplicates
and press OK and you can see one
duplicate value is found and it has been
removed and six unique values to remain
so that's how you use the function of
removing duplicates in Excel so on my
screen you can see a simple spreadsheet
with student names and their marks on my
sheet so we will be calculating what are
the total marks obtained by the students
and overall subjects and calculate what
is the percentage now we will carry
forward a few simple inbuilt functions
in Excel to calculate that
first we will be calculating the sum of
marks so here equals to sum function
select the range of cells
close the bracket press enter
so you have the sum now
so we have to calculate it repeat so by
clicking on the same formula now we have
the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing
407 by 500 and then we will be
multiplying that into 100 so that's how
we calculate the percentage so
cell G2 divided by cell H2 press enter
and you will end up with you know the
decimal format that's perfectly all
right
now we have also extended the same
formula for all our cells now select
this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that
decimal format but when you press
percentage you'll have the actual
percentage of all the students according
to their Max achievement so that's how
you calculate percentage in Excel now on
my screen you can see the sales of four
quarters from different regions that is
east west south north and Central now
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened from all the regions in
q1 or you might want to calculate the
sum of sales happened in one region of
all the four quarters
that is either you want to calculate the
sum of all the regions from quarter 1 or
you might want to calculate the sum of
all the quarters in one region right so
to do this you have some simple
functions in Excel so you might say me
you have some function Etc right for
that you might want to go into the you
know equals to mode and fetch some
option and subtotal or sum UPS you have
to select the function from here but
what if I tell you that there is one
simple easy shortcut where you just have
to make one single click and you'll have
all the sum right so that seems
interesting so on the top in the home
bar select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation
so you have different aggregations here
some average count numbers maximum
minimum more functions here you might
want to select this sum and you can get
all summation numbers here
so I'll select one cell so the second
query where we wanted to calculate the
sum of all these sales happened in east
region with all the quarters included
that is this one C2 to f 2 right so let
us select J2 and
select the autosum option and here it
will automatically select the range for
you that is C2 to F2 if you want to
change it can also you know change it
like minimize the number if you just
wanted to calculate the sum of three
quarters you can do that so now we want
to Fogo test so select enter and there
you go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of east region now if you
simply drag it you will have the sum of
all the four quarters of all different
regions
now let us calculate the summation of q1
of all the regions that is this one
select AutoZone and it will
automatically select all the cells for
you
that is from C2 to C6 right press enter
and you'll have the summation similarly
you can you know drag it and you have
the numbers here of all the Q2 sales of
all the regions Q3 sense of fall region
and Q4 sales of all region
now let us try to change the colors that
you can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's this total sum or
right you just have a reference to
identify it
now similarly to this one as well
so that's how you implement Auto sum in
Excel how to insert PDF in Excel now
there are multiple ways to insert a PDF
into Excel so we will go through a
couple of ways first is here let us
imagine that we wanted to insert some
PowerPoint presentation in PDF format
into our Excel sheet so that it belongs
to excel Basics now click on the cell
where you want to add the PDF or just
click any cell in the Excel spreadsheet
then go to the option of insert in the
toolbar then navigate to text option
click on it and select object
and here you can select create from file
and then you can browse
and here you have your Excel Basics PDF
in my documents click on that select
insert so here you can just press ok
and the PDF will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of PDF to fit the cell
there you go the PDF got successfully
inserted into your Excel spreadsheet now
let's discuss about the second way now
the second way is completely same the
only difference is you can add some logo
to your PDF so you can see it has been
added in direct form of a PDF like what
sticker first slide of the PPT but
instead of that if you wanted to
highlight it as an icon then you can
select the display as icon button here
and press ok now you don't have to
reformat the size of your PPD or PDF all
you have to do is add the logo to your
PDF and it will also include the title
so this is another way of adding you
know PDF to your Excel sheet now another
way so a few times you don't want the
first page of the PDF to be visible or
any kind of logo of that PDF reader to
be visible on your spreadsheet sometimes
all you want is some dedicated image or
a dedicated logo right so so this time
let's try to add a dedicated image to
our PDF so go to insert again here you
can see the illustrations option click
on picture and from this device so I
will select the simply launch logo and
now you have to resize the logo a little
bit to fit the cell
there you go
you can click on the right click button
and and select the option of Link
now select the existing file or web page
option so if you are interested to learn
more on hyperlink in Excel we have a
dedicated tutorial on that please go
through hyperlinks in Excel by simply
learn which will explain you everything
about hyperlinks in Excel how to insert
them different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page
and go to documents navigate to
documents and inside this you have the
Excel basic PDF click on OK and it has
been added to your image so when you
click on it it will open the PDF
document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open now here
on my spreadsheet you can see some data
so this particular data has some column
markings so we have used color codes to
Mark the designations of all the
employees with different colors so for
example blue for manager purple for
senior and so on right now our duty is
to count the total number of employees
present in a company based on the color
code this can be done using filters but
let's try with color tools now we don't
have a readily available function in
Excel to count cells based on their
colors but we can make use of macro now
to make use of macro you might want to
enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar
and you can see this particular option
click on the customize ribbon option and
you will be provided with various set of
options
now on the right side you can see
developer options
so make sure the check box is clicked to
enable developer options and press on OK
to completely enable developer vendor
right now when you click on developer
options you can see various options here
visual Basics macro Etc now click on the
macro to create a macro now just give a
name to the macro function so I'll give
simply learn
and press on create to create that
particular macro function
so we have already created a macro that
is Count colors as which we will be
using in our current spreadsheet for
counting the colored cells now let us
erase the newly created function
now getting back to the original code so
how does this particular count colored
cells works so let us understand the
function first then we will try to make
use of it in this spreadsheet so the
function name is Count colored cells as
you can see and this particular function
will have two parameters current cell
and spreadsheet area so the current cell
will be the cell address where the color
you want to count is present and then
the spreadsheet area so what is the
range of cells where you want to locate
that particular color and count the
number of repetitions that is the
spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used
colored cell range color code and color
cell count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is color cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell dot interior dot
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equals to the
current cells color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell dot interior dot
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equals to
plus one initially by default it will be
0 in case if this particular if
condition is true that is the current
cell color and the color code given is
equals to same then the value of colored
cell will increase by 1. and this
particular if Loop will run as many
number of times the condition is true so
let us imagine that the condition will
remain true for five times then we have
obtained five similarly colored cells in
the given range of cells in a
spreadsheet and once the condition fails
then the latest value present in color
cell count variable will be displayed
which will be a final result so this is
how the macro function works now let's
close the macro window and get back to
our spreadsheet now let us try to make
use of the macro function that we just
created so that is equals to count
colored cells press tab to select the
macro function and the first one is the
current cell so this is the current cell
where the current color has been
provided comma this cell range so our
cell range will be from c 2 to c31
right so this is the range where we want
to count the similarly colored cells
that is sky blue colored cells close the
function and press enter now you can see
the function has identified six
repetitions of sky blue color in this
particular range of cells now you can
drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be
providing the results of the scene so
six senior colors that is pink or purple
color then two repetitions of this
particular color two repetitions of
trainee color five for dark blue and six
for green right so this is how the macro
function works and the key point to
remember here is this particular macro
will work only for manually colored
cells so there are situations where we
have used conditional formatting to
color a single cell let us imagine that
we have used conditional formatting to
recognize the employees with salary
above 30 000 as green color and if you
try to use that particular green color
to be counted by the color count cells
function now it will not happen it will
not consider that color as a feedback or
an input now in future we will also try
to design a macro which can recognize
the colors made by conditional
formatting as well but this particular
function will be exclusively used for
manually colored cells only
so for that we might want to use a few
simple functions in Excel and let's get
started with it so on the first sheet we
will try to add some data so we will be
using data validation in Excel so we
don't want all that list of data to be
appearing on our calendar right so for
that reason let's create a new sheet and
in the sheet let's add a month
and also let's consider a few years we
are not creating the automatically
updating calendar for just one year
let's create for a couple of years maybe
uh a 10 right so let's add in January
and Excel has this feature where you can
just drag it and you'll get all the
months all together at once
so it should be around December yeah
January February March April May June
July August September October November
and December similarly so we are in 2022
right now so let's add 2023 and a couple
of more years maybe
so
just Ctrl not Ctrl shift load Arrow key
and now drag that to the December part I
think we'll get uh 12 years so we have
2033
now our list is ready now let's get back
to the original sheet and try to take
month and year as well copy the cells
and paste it here
so there you go we have our months and
ears now this will be ourselves months
and years so here get into Data option
and here get into the data validation
option and here select list option and
now it will ask you for the source now
where is the source this is our source
so we are hiding the sheet from the
users
now select OK and there you go now you
have a drop down menu same goes to here
get into the data validation option
select list and
go to the ship number two where we have
hidden are okay select Source now go
into the sheet to where we have hidden
our ears select the range
and press ok
so there you have our Mandan here so
months you can select any one out of 12
so you have this crawl bar here and
similarly you can select any ear which
you want so for now let's select 2022
and the first month of 2022.
now here
our calendar
so let's type in Monday
and the same applies here you can just
drag it until Saturday
and Sunday so you have all that here
right
now let's keep it a little wider so that
it's visible a little clearer
okay not too wide
that should be good
now
we will begin creating the calendar
so we don't know what day was the first
of
January 2022. of course it's Saturday
but what if we didn't know or we don't
have any idea of the upcoming years what
if if someone asks you what's the first
day of Jan 1st of 2033 so it would be a
little difficult right so let's use the
help of few inbuilt formulas from Excel
to find it out so you can use the
inbuilt function that is data value
there you go we have our date value and
in date value we will consider the month
and the year but before that let's
provide the date value as 1 for default
which is the first day
so this is our date value and hyphen now
let's press Ampersand to add the
remaining part that is the month and uh
year so we use Ampersand and
press double quotes and inside double
quotes press
ler I guess we already have a hyphen so
instead of hyphen what we can do is we
can directly select the month cell
there we go we have the month cell and
after that now we might need the hyphen
hyphen and press the and percent again
now our error value
so there you go we have our date value
function ready press enter and there you
can see some random numbers over here
this is because of a little formatting
error so you can change it you can get
into home and in home you can see the
number group and select that and inside
that you'll have custom option you can
also check with the date option but
let's go with the custom as we might
want to add a few more extra things to
our date right so here you go so you
have date month year
right so we'll also add
a date word
calendar just DDT they should help us
with the week as well that is first John
2022 Saturday
right but you can see that it doesn't go
with Monday right here we have Monday
but the date is first John and it is
Saturday and this cell is supposed to be
coming here right so there is some error
regarding this so this position of the
week can be fixed right this position of
the week can be fixed that's what we are
going to focus on in The Next Step so
what we need is the same formula but
with a little modification to it what
we're gonna do is subtract this with
weekday of this particular value right
so now what you're gonna do is minus
weekday formula
tap space and try to copy the same
formula and place it inside the weekday
function
copy
paste and another
yeah it should be somewhere here so
another attribute what weekday considers
is the date value uh the day value that
is a few people will consider Sunday as
the first day of a week few will
consider Monday as the first day of the
week so accordingly we have here so if
you are the one who's considering Sunday
is the first day of a week then the
attribute should be one but here we are
considering Monday as the first day of
our week so our attribute will be three
so tap space to select it and close the
function there you go now you have the
formula ready to identify the correct
position of the weekday and the date
value right now usually we might require
or we know that we have four weeks in a
month but sometimes you might end up
having five weeks or even six weeks
according to the arrangement of the
position of the day and day to Value so
for that let's create six rows to be on
the safest side so for that let's again
cut phase test formula here to the first
day that is Monday and as we know this
is the perfect day that is 27th of
December 2021 right now our first day of
January 2022 is somewhere over here so
you are just going to add one value to
it right
so equals to and the cell Value Plus 1.
enter
so that we have our next day so again
you can just drag it to have all the
seven days
there you go we have the perfect dates
and similarly this one so let's try to
select all of these and drag a little
bit
so that we have a little more space to
fit in our data
there you go now here you're adding
seven more days to complete the week so
here we'll add the cell Value Plus seven
days to get the next adjacent date right
so the value of the date Plus 7.
seven days of a week to get the next
consecutive date followed by the second
January will have third January right
and now he can do the same to this one
and you'll have the consecutive days now
drag this to all the
for rows so that we have six rows there
you go our calendar is perfectly fine
now now we'll try to do few more
modifications to our date value so
instead of having all the month here and
the week name we can just keep it as
just the date number right so just get
into numbers again numbers row and here
eliminate all these data and just keep D
for date press ok so there you go we
have our perfect date Arrangement over
here
now
we will try to
minimize the calendar length or or we
can just you know make a few
modifications to it Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and
Sunday right now we will
make some modifications
then try to fit it
there you go it looks good now but we
still have one issue to fix that is we
still have a few days from our previous
year that is 2021 and we have a few days
from February as well right so this
looks like a problem
which is fixable so we can make use of
conditional formatting here to fix this
so get into home and conditional
formatting and end conditional
formatting try to use a new rule and use
the formula to determine which cells to
format now here we are going to use the
month function
month of the first cell that is
two
five in my case
not equal to month of
any any cell in between the month so
when you choose this one and press ok
so what you want to do if if the cells
are not equal what you want to do get
into format
and
get into number
and here choose custom
choose as three semicolons or you can
also do an idea of you know kind of
blurring the numbers up so for now I'll
choose to eliminate the numbers or you
know remove the numbers or keep a blank
space when the condition fails right so
we're going to use three semicolons to
fix that and press OK and press ok so
there you go
having said that if you are an aspiring
data analyst looking for online x-ray
certification from the expert
universities and in collaboration with
the real-time industry experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
in collaboration with IBM from the
Purdue University should be the right
choice for more details on this course
please click the link in the description
box below how to sort data in Excel so
on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column F and
the gene you can see employee date of
birth and employee native joining for
example you wanted to sort the employee
data in the form of earliest joining
employee and the latest joining employer
right that is who is the employee who
joined first to this company and who is
the employer who joined loss to this
company so for that you just need to
select the column of date so let's
select both the columns and go to home
and check or verify if the data type is
date or not so generally the data type
will be set to General by default by
Excel so we need to make sure that we
have the proper data type which is State
now that we have the proper data type
select the entire column and go to the
data option and here select the sort
option add in the sort option select the
expand selection click on sort and here
sort by employee date of joining and
hold us to news that's what we wanted
the oldest employee or the you can also
set it to the newest employer tools
according to your requirement but we'll
go to oldest to newest according to the
case study right now just click on OK
and that should be done so Emily was a
manager is the oldest employee who
joined the company and Chris was a
trainee and it support is the latest
employer who joined the company now
that's how you sort date in Excel now we
are on the Excel spreadsheet so you can
see that I have five different sheets of
the same data so why do we have that so
I'll be explaining you how to sort data
for multiple parameters so firstly we
will try to sort data in the form of
numbers right so let us imagine that
this data is being shared with you by
your manager and he wants you to sort
this data based on the salary numbers so
he wants you to arrange the data in the
form of ascending order or descending
order may be which will help him find
the employee with the highest salary
right so how could you do that
so it's really simple you could sort the
entire data just within a few clicks so
how would you do that so since you're
focusing on salary select any cell from
the salary column only right select this
particular column and select any cell in
the salary column get into the sort and
filter options and here select this sort
of arrangement you need that is largest
or smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to find
the highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation senior and he
works in IIT support and he draws the
highest salary of eighty thousand right
and there's also another one which is
pepper and she works for the analytics
team
and now
the next sheet let's get into the sheet
too and this time let us imagine that
you wanted to you know uh arrange or
sort the data based on the employee date
of joining or date of birth right again
if you wanted to arrange the data in
which you find the youngest employee or
the oldest employee of the organization
you can do that click on any cell in the
date of birth column and go back to the
sort and filter and here you will be
seeing the options sort old test to the
newest or the sort the data from newest
to the oldest so since we want the
oldest employee select oldest and newest
and the echo so the oldest employee is
Alfred who is an associate designation
employee and he works in the admin
department and he's throwing the salary
of 25 000. so that's how you can sort
the data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here
now uh single column wise is perfectly
fine there is no issues with that now
you wanted to you know let's imagine
that you have two columns okay let's
eliminate a few columns here
Maybe
we can eliminate the employee ID and uh
okay let's keep a few columns so we'll
just keep employee name and employee
salary
okay so here we are trying to
demonstrate if you are trying to sort
the data using one cell in the column B
will it maintain its relationship with
the cell a okay uh that's our query
right so let's see I'll go a little
detail so let us imagine that you wanted
to sort this data based on highest
salary okay so when you do that will it
also impact the cells in the column A so
it will basically impact but just uh
it's a query right any of you viewers
might have that variable I uh if in case
if I try to sort the data based on this
will it affect the cells on the rest of
the data set okay so in basically it
will impact so I'll try to you know sort
the data based on ascending order
yeah
so this is the smallest to largest and
you can see uh the Tony and pepper so
since I selected the cell in the column
B it also impacted the change on the
cells of column A so that's how the
Sorting works now we'll get to a little
Advanced sorting techniques so here we
try to I mean already we try to sort the
data based on numbers based on alphabets
based on you know uh date of birth right
so I think we forgot the uh ascending or
you know sorting based on alphabets
let's do that as well select any um cell
in the column A and go to certain filter
try selecting a to z or okay let's try
to Z to A okay so here you can see the
names have been sorted based on the
descending order from Z to A right so so
far we tried on alphabets so far we
tried on numbers date of birth and
a couple of more things so let's dig a
little deeper and try to sort based on
colors right so for that you don't uh
you know find that uh extra setting here
in the regular certain filter so you
might want to get into the data option
and here you'll find another sort
function which is a little at once so
that's how you do it so since we have
colored in this cell or column of salary
select that salary and we're going with
cell value so in the cell values section
select the cell color and here on the
cell color options you'll have green
blue and yellow that's what we have used
in our cells so let's keep Green in the
first position which is on top and press
ok now you'll see greens means ordered
at the first position now yellow and
blue are left up so why is that so
because you didn't provide it right so
you can do what that as well I mean you
can always add the setting to it
select any cell go to sort and add a
level and then again select the salary
and sell values to cell colors and now
the cell color in the second position
would be blue
and that will be on bottom and they can
add another level
the same salary
the cell values will be cell color and
cell yellow will be somewhere in between
our bottom
okay so based on hierarchy it will be
selecting press ok
and
there you go so you have cell yellow and
blue at the bottom and green at the top
position as per your suggestions
now we are on the last sheet so here in
this last sheet we are going to you know
um dig a little deeper into the advanced
sorting methods so previously we tried
to apply the advanced sorting methods
for colors now we'll try to apply the
advanced sorting methods based on the
data set we have here I mean the data we
have in our data set right so select the
sort option and let's add a few details
right so firstly let's sort the column
employee ID okay so let's have this
smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will sort
okay uh I think we will sort based on
employee that would be a little better
so let's try to uh sort it on employee
name here and here will be employee
salary
okay now the cell values and this would
be from A to Z and the salary will be
from the smallest to largest so
basically what we are trying to do is we
are trying to sort the employee list
based on employee names from A to Z so
the employee's name starting from A to Z
will be ordered first and another subset
of the Sorting will be done based on
highest salaries that is smallest to
highest so let us imagine that we have
three employees with name starting from
a and their salaries are ten thousand
twenty thousand and thirty thousand so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
higher salary and the last right so this
is how the algorithm works for sorting
now let's press OK and see the output
so there you go the names are Alfred and
you have the highest salary here
smallest to highest so this is 25 000
next we have Banner bonds and Ben
so here you might be seeing why we have
been in the third position despite he
has a low salary and name starts with B
right so here it is trying to work based
on the alphabets in the order right so B
A and B E it's not just comparing the
first letter it's also comparing the
following letters as well right so n
comes first R comes later so bonds is
pushed to the second position a comes
first and E comes later so B A let us R
push to the first position and Ben is
pushed to the third position so that's
how A2 works right so accordingly the
set for B A is created here 3540 next
Ben 12 and next you have Bobby Brian
Brock Chris Clark right so that's how
the data has been organized and sorted
based on multiple levels of parameters
you provide for sorting so that's how
you use sorting in Excel
so what is data validation in Excel so
it is a feature by Microsoft Excel where
it can restrict data entry into certain
cells by using data validation
and it will prompt the users to enter
valid data in the cells based on the
rules and restrictions provided by the
creator of that particular sheet now
this would be a little confusing to
understand so to understand it in a much
better way let's get back to the
practical way where we will start
entering some data validation rules to
our Excel sheet and try to enter data
into it now we are on the Microsoft
Excel and this particular sheet is based
on employee ID employee name employee
Department employee salary fiscal year
and work timings of the employees
now we will be applying some data
validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rows we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employee ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar
and inside the ribbon you can see data
tools group and in the data tools group
you have the option of data validation
now select the entire column go to the
data tools group select data validation
option and you will have this particular
pop-up menu
and here you can see different types of
options so since we are entering
employee ID it would be a whole number
so let us select whole number option and
now here you can see the option of
between not equal to equal to not
between greater than less than Etc
so let us select between
and let us assume that your employee ID
has five numbers and it should be
between 10 000 to
11 000.
so let us provide 10 000
and 11 000.
now select ok
and now the new rule has been applied
so now the minimum value of each and
every employee ID should be equal to or
more than 10 000 and less than 11 000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one
there you go you can see that Microsoft
Excel is not allowing you to include a
wrong number it says this value does not
match the data validation restrictions
defined for this cell so now you can
press retry and try to enter some number
which is in between 10 000 to 11 000.
now it is 10901 and this will take the
entry
now let us assume that because I am the
creator of this I know what should
be entered here but what if I give this
 to you and you are the person who
is trying to enter the number and it
shows the error and you don't know what
was the error right to avoid this kind
of confusion what you can do is you can
do some uh ways where you can provide
the message to the user so that can be
done by okay let's select this sheet
again and go to the data validation and
here you have the same settings now here
you have another option saying input
message
so before input message let us go to
error alert
now here
the error title will be data entered
is
not valid
please enter this is the error message
please enter
EMP
ID
between
10 000 to 11 000.
press ok
now when you try to enter the wrong
number it will show that particular
error alert message
see data entered is not valid please
enter employee ID between 10 000 to 11
000. now this is fine but how long this
will be you know what if there is an
option where you just hover over to the
cell and it automatically tells you to
enter the value between ten thousand to
eleven thousand without having to face
the error yeah even that can be done so
you can select
the entire column go to data validation
and here this is the input message this
is where you can do that
so here you can write the message name
valid data
please enter
data between
10 000 to
11 000 now when you hover over to any
cell in this particular column it will
automatically show you this message
where you can avoid all the errors
just select OK see when you select any
cell in this particular column it will
automatically tell you please enter data
between ten thousand to eleven thousand
so here you don't have to face any
errors right now let us try to enter the
valid data
1 0 9
0 2
and it will take it as the correct value
and again 1 0 9 0 3.
now in case if you try to provide the
wrong number it will show the error
see
so that's how it is now we have finished
the whole number part now let's get into
the employee name where we have to
provide
the second type that is
text length now let us imagine that uh
in your company you are trying to
provide ID cards to your employees and
you know that ID card is really small
and inside that ID card you need to
include the employee photograph and your
company name employee ID blood group
phone number address everything and also
you need to include the name of the
employer so what if there is an employer
with very lengthy name like 30
characters 40 characters yeah in India
it is really possible that you might
have a lengthy name so what you can do
is you can provide the text length where
the text is limited to like 15 or 20 uh
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length minimum can be anything
so minimum can be one and maximum here
you can provide 15. and press ok
OK minimum will change it to at least
two
and yeah let it be one
so minimum is 1 and maximum is 15
characters and press ok
and let us also provide the input
message
enter
character type character data
please enter valid name
and error alert
invalid data
please enter validator
please enter characters
less than
50.
press ok
now let us try to enter a random name
okay we'll enter characters more than 15
here equality
yeah it's like one two three four five
eleven
okay now this is more than 15.
okay I think it's not more than 15.
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters
now we have entered more than 15
characters and it is showing please
enter characters less than 15. so now we
can retry and try to enter some valid
name
um
now we have characters less than 50 so
it will take as the proper name
now let us try to enter another name
foreign
data
so another name maybe
great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary fiscal
year and work timings after that we'll
learn about the list one
now let's come into employee salary so
salary is something where you have to
include decimal points so now let us go
to a data validation and inside the
values we have already dealt with whole
number
text length
yeah now we'll deal with employee salary
that is decimal
now minimum is okay what is the minimum
can be one
point zero zero and maximum can be
one lakh
0.00 or let us
put that as 10 lakhs
press ok
not not just them and enter valid
salary
okay now let's change it to minimum is
10 000.
so the employee minimum salary will be
10 000 and input enter valid salary
and uh
salary
between
10 000
to 10 lakhs
it is include come here too
now error alert
invalid salary
please enter
foreign
press ok now the message and the data
validation conditions are applied to
this column now let us try to enter some
invalid data first
it will show the error
now we need to enter the valid data
yeah now it is taking the valid data let
us provide twenty thousand
and this is 35 000.
now the next one is fiscally let us
imagine that we wanted to you know work
on the employees for current working
gear that is 2020 to 2021 and or you can
consider 2021 to 2022 not more than 2021
and not less than 2021 for that you can
provide the year option as well so for
that you need to select the entire
column go to data validation settings
and inside here you have an option of
date
so let us provide the date option as
between and start date is 0 1 0 1 slash
2021 and end date is 0 1 0 1 slash
2022
and input message
let us provide data as current
fiscal year
Current financial year
enter date
between
2021 to 2022
let us copy this and go into error alert
error message will be saved
invalid
[Music]
select ok now there are message and the
data input message and the data
validation rule has been applied for
this column so let's try to enter some
date here
you can enter 0 2 of February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2020 to 0 to 0 2
20
22 it will not take this it will throw
error
so that's how it works now let us try to
enter as 2021
and this is March
it will take it now another data
0 4 this time and 2021
so that's how your date data validation
will work now coming into the next type
of data validation that is time
so we have time here let us imagine that
you are providing some work timings to
your employees that should be from 9 am
to 5 PM not more than that so you want
to keep your work life balanced for all
your employees so you just want them to
work between nine to five and that
should be fine and anything apart from
that time should be invalid so you can
do that by selecting a Time option
between it should be in between and the
start time will be 0 9
0 0 and this should be
uh
17.
that is 5 PM in the evening
and input message
please enter
time between
9 am
to
okay
5 PM
this should be the input message
now error alert
invalid time
error message
now
okay work timings now this should be
okay
we can do this as two columns actually
let us
cancel
let us copy this and paste it here
you can do it as login
timing and this should be okay
this should be logged out
so this should be
okay so this will be considered as login
and logout times
now let us provide the login time
this should be the right time and let's
try to provide wrong timings zero eight
now it will not take it it will throw as
error
so it's working fine let us provide 10
now let us provide the logout time it
should be below 5 PM
so let us provide five it will take it
okay
let's try to provide something just one
minute less than five
okay there is some problem in this let's
check it
foreign
that is including seconds
okay let's provide seconds as well
zero five zero zero zero zero
okay still there is some problem
okay we have entered four we should we
are supposed to enter 24 hour timing
right
14
okay uh it should be 17. I think this
will work yeah
now we are following 24 hour timing here
so let's provide another timing that is
16
30 0 0 this will be valid and 15 30.
this is also value now we have finished
almost all types of data validation
things that is we have finished with any
value whole number decimal date timing
test length and the last one is list so
this is where things get interesting now
let's cancel this now
select the employee column now if you
are running a company then definitely
you will not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team so what you can do is you can
provide a list
so using that list you can just hover
over to that cell select the drop down
menu and inside that you can select the
option so we will try to work something
like that if we have selected the entire
column
selection
let us select the entire column again go
to data validation
the selection contains some cells
without data validation settings do you
want to extend data validation to this
yes
now let us provide the list option
and
here Source you can provide us
developer
and test
press okay okay
now input message
select one
select one
error alert
invalid
data
select from drop down
only
press ok
now when you select the cell you can see
small drop down icon right so when you
press it you will have developer and
tester option
so you can select developer for first
one and for second one you can select
tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
see your second list developer tester
quality analyst system analyst Finance
human resource so so many options are
there so you cannot keep on typing all
of them right so here it is 15 what if
you have like 25 like 50 departments
right it will be tough so for this you
have another option so let me select all
this data and copy this from this sheet
to our employee sheet
let us paste it somewhere
here
let's expand this
okay now we have our list over here now
let us remove the data validation from
this column
clear all okay now everything is clear
let's select okay now let us erase this
data as well
foreign
now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to list
now here we can select the source
select this particular cell
and drag it until here
and it has been loaded
now go to input message
data options
select one
from the menu or the drop down
okay
error alert
select only from the drop down menu
invalid entry yeah
now let's select ok
fine now you have the icon here you have
all the provided options
you can scroll down and select any one
of these you can select knowledge
transfer for the first one and second
one would be
system analyst
and the last one would be
human resources
now in the list everything is fine okay
this is showing you the menu options and
everything
so but what if you provide this sheet to
your new Journey or new employee in your
company and by mistake he messes up
something like deleting this okay so we
have deleted systems analysts and when
you click on the options here you don't
have systems analyst in that place you
have blank space right so there is a way
where all your you know data can be
messed up so to avoid this what you can
do is
you can actually
um
save this data in a different sheet like
I did here like Department data you can
hide the sheet or you can protect the
sheet with password or something so that
nobody can mess this up so now let us
get back to the employee data and select
this column and
clear everything
press ok
and let us also clear this
okay
and this that's what this one too
now let us eliminate the rows our cells
the employee
everything
okay now we have basically removed this
data from here
now let us try to apply the data
validation once again
now here
let us select as list
and
here let us provide the option
let us go to next sheet let us select
all these options
and press ok
OK let's provide input message
data options
or Department options
particularly
yeah now let's select ok
now let's hide this sheet
uh the sheet has been hidden and you
still have the options
developer
or let us provide see you
then we have developer
then we have
test
so that's how you can protect your
sheets as well now this is how you apply
data validation in your Excel now what
is indirect function in Excel so the
name itself conveys that it is something
like a reference function right so it
refers to a cell which is present in a
particular sheet or the current sheet or
it refers to a particular range in the
current sheet or it can also refer to an
entire workbook in a current window
right so you can stay here on the sheet
number one and you can refer something
which is present on the sheet number 10
or 11. you can stay in this current
workbook and refer to something which is
around in a different workbook
altogether so that's exactly how the
indirect function in Excel works okay so
I guess the definition was a little
difficult to get let me show you a
simple demo here so that it becomes a
little easier for you So currently I am
in the cell number A2 right now here I
will implement the indirect function
press tab to select it and now I'll
refer to the cell C2
and let's enter and there you go let me
properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so
equals to indirect and press tab to
select now I'll be selecting the cell C2
and inside C2 we have E2 address now the
formula is fine I have implemented the
indirect function and selected the cell
E2 and now if I press enter see the
magic there you go so in the cell E2 we
have the text hello open so when I use
the indirect function to refer which is
something in C2 it is indirectly
referring to another cell address that
is E2 which has a text hello world now
this one was a little pretty simpler now
let's check some complicated ones and
we'll move to sheet number one
here we have some student names and
their uh you know uh marks on the
individual subjects that has math
science English computer science and
here and here you can see I'm selecting
the student names and accordingly I'm
getting their average score and the
total marks obtained right seems
interesting how did I do this so this is
done exactly using the indirect function
so let's do it again so this is how you
do it now here I will be using okay
before we get into this we need to do
some fundamentals before we do it right
so the fundamentals are you need to name
your individual columns so here I have
Brian and his marks so I'll select
entire marks of brine ranging from B2 to
B for right click and here you can see
Define name and I'll be naming it as
grind
it's already named we might get an error
so it's already name okay let's add
another one maybe
uh Jennifer
let's cancel this
so let's add
Jenny
and her marks will be 96
87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here
so 87.
so we have the new column here now we
need to name this column Define a name
and it's gen so Excel has automatically
selected the name for this column so
let's press ok now we have our columns
ready now here if you see the drop down
we have Amy Banner Brian Brock Emily
Jenny John everyone over here right so
the columns are new the individual
columns are named so now the student
name so here you can use some simple
trick called Data validation here select
the data option in the toolbar navigate
to data tools here select data
validation
and in this instead of any value select
list and here give the source as this
particular set
press ok so that you get the drop down
menu over here you can also type the
individual names again when you type the
individual names you might go wrong with
the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average will be
uh equals to average
press tab to select now the indirect
function indirect of
the cell address
and close the bracket first you might
get an error because currently it is
empty so select some name and you'll get
your average score now same thing
applies to you know total you can press
the sum function select the sum function
and type in the indirect function and
the cell
v11 close the brackets
and press enter so that's how you do it
so that's how you can Implement indirect
function in Excel with that we have come
to an end of this
so now we are on the Excel sheet and you
can see that in this particular Excel
sheet we have some student details we
have the serial numbers names roll
numbers class blood group and some
subjects like maths science computer
statistics social GK and the final marks
obtained percentage and total marks
right so let us imagine that a company
has come for an interview
so all these students are going to
attend an interview and the minimum
percentage to attend the interview will
be like 75 percent so you can see that
we have 75 here and all the students
have got above 75 except for the one
student which is Mike right so for Mike
to attend the interview he needs 75
percentage or above so uh he can make
some modifications in one of these
subjects right so there is always an
exam after the exam called as
Improvement exam so if you can like this
course and extra marks in the subjects
which you have scored less so that you
can make up to the percentage what
you're expecting you can do that so here
in this particular sheet uh Mike has six
subjects right and in such subjects you
can see he has code 76 91 45 71 94 and
62. so out of these he have scored less
and one subject compared to all the
subjects one subject is really low that
is computers so what if he can give an
improvement exam and increase his
percentage to 75 right so that can be
done so if we can do some Brute Force
methods like we can change the marks
like 55 and then check this particular
one so it's getting 74 right so using
the brute force method will be a little
bit lengthy so you can do this because
it is just a small table which has least
number of data and you just have one
single cell to modify so that can be
done in small tables but what if you had
some table with hundreds of rows or
thousands of rows that will be time
consuming right so for that we have some
inbuilt functionality in Excel that is
called goal seek in Excel so for now
let's eliminate the marks here
so we have eliminated the marks and the
upgraded percentage is 65. now we need
the target as 75. okay so let's write it
as
Mike's Target right we need mic so mics
new Target as
75.
[Music]
okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75
percentage we will use the data
operation so here on the toolbar which
has file home insert Etc we have one
other option called as data so when you
click on data from toolbar you'll have
this ribbon and in this ribbon we have
various options so when you come into
forecast group we have an option called
what if analysis when you click on
what-if analysis you'll have a set of
options out of which we have goal seek
now for goal seek we need to select a
table cell that is this particular table
cell that is M9 so we need the value 75
here right so what is the cell that you
need to change here for that you need to
select this one and select this
particular cell here right and now you
can select ok now you can see that Excel
has automatically run all the
permutations and combinations and has
come up with a number so that the
overall percentage of mic will be 75
percent right so the expected marks that
Mike should be getting in his computers
Improvement exam should be equal to 56
or greater than 56 to get the final
Target as 75 so that he can attend the
company's interview so this is how we
use goal set or goal seek in Excel we
are on our Excel spreadsheet and here
you can see I am trying to create an
calendar for the employees company where
you might have to you know write down
the day and month and year or week of
your birth date or maybe your joining
date or maybe also your last working day
right this might be useful for all the
employees too you know avoid them from
writing it down manually
so how do I create it so it takes a few
simple steps all it takes is some data
validation methods and also there is an
exclusive video specifically made on
data validation in Excel linked to which
is in the description box below or you
can search it on our official YouTube
channel now you can see that the word
calendar is on the first cell that is A1
but we have four cells below it that is
A3 B3 C3 and D3 so you might want to add
this to all the cells right like maybe
in the middle so for that you can do the
option of margin Center also there is a
tutorial on Origin Center about all the
options available in this particular
thing so you can go through that also
and here we have done the first step now
all we need is day month year and week
so in a calendar or in a month you'll
have days from 28 29 30 or 31 days right
so let's create a list or the drop down
menu for that so that whenever you click
it right so whenever you click on that
particular cell you will have the list
of all the things available right so
let's get started by that
let's create a new sheet
so why are we creating a new sheet you
won't want that all the numbers in your
calendar sheet right over here right so
for that so we are creating a new sheet
and all the data will be available here
so here let's write down the days
first and here the second number also
you can use the option of Slash fill so
that you can you know reduce the effort
here so you can see the flash flow
option over here all you need to do is
select the cells and drag them down
until you get your required dates right
so let's keep it to 31 days like when
you have the days
so this will be your days and here
now the next option was month right yeah
month and year now using the same Flash
Fill option you will you know add the
months into your sheet
so this will be Sunday
so Excel has this smart Flash Fill
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be filled according
to your requirements so Sunday to
Saturday now the next one right that is
your month
it's the same as the before process will
create
January
you can use the Flash Fill option and
all the way up to December now the last
one was the year
so in 1990
and
1991 if you will select the cells and
Flash Fill Up to
2022 will be
yeah 2022 should be good enough
now this is The Flash full option you
have here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on Flash Fill all together you
can go through it for a detailed
explanation as well now coming back to
the original sheet so this is where you
create your drop down list right so
select the cell where you want to add
the drop down list navigate to data and
then here is your data validation menu
so we have a variety of data validation
options over here there is an exclusive
tutorial on that you can go through it
for now we'll look into the list option
only because we want to create a drop
down list right so here it will ask for
Subs click on the source here the source
bar right now navigate to sheet number
two where we have the days options
select the range
so this will be your range and select OK
also you can add some message here right
what you can do is uh in case if there
is an error or something right you don't
want that to be happening so all you
need to do is uh write down select from
drop down
select from drop down only
so this could be a message select from
drop down only the title is Select
options or just options
in case if there's an error you can
write down your title as invalid data
and you can write on a messages
please select
from drop down only
so in case of someone tries to write as
32 or 33 to check the Integrity of your
data validation then they will encounter
an error and an error message and then
they must be understanding what exactly
they try to do and if it's correct or
wrong right so this is to make sure that
whatever the data you enter is correct
and valid
so okay and here you can see select from
the drop down list only options with
option list as title and let's try to
enter 32 right and when you press enter
you will see
an error so the error messages invalid
data please try to select from drop down
only so you can go for retry and select
it from there right
so let's eliminate them and now select
something from the drop down so let's
take advantage
maybe 10 right so this is how you clear
the day one now let's try to do with the
month
same data validation option
settings will be list
and Source will be
this one
think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet 2 and
rename this as our week
yeah now coming back to the month again
it will be a list
and the source will be in sheet 2
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and the input message the same
options
to select from drop down only
title will be invalid data
this one will be please select
from drop down
apologies
okay and that's done now let's continue
with here as well let's quickly do the
same
foreign
and lastly the week
sing
process it will be a list
shows will be in your sheet too
the input message
options
title invalid data
it's drop down
only
right so your drop down list is ready
now so the month will be anything So
currently we have me and here can be
anything anywhere so let's take it as
1997 and we can be you know the edges in
the week and so what was 10th of May
1997.
let's check our calendars
so it was a Saturday
so it was a Saturday and that's how you
create a drop down list in Excel and if
you want you can also add borders to
your calendar right
so that's how it's done
so on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right so now let us imagine
that we want to add filters on the
region part so we have southwest east
Etc right so we want to you know let us
imagine that you want to extract the
data of only west region and you wanted
a filter so doing it manually could take
a lot of time so using filters will be
helpful now select one cell on the
headers part and select the filter
option in the data toolbar you can see
the date option on the toolbar right so
click on the date option and navigate to
sort and filter group and in that select
the option of filter now you can see the
filters are been added to all the column
headers region category state
subcategory sales quantity right now we
wanted the West category so when you see
or when you click on the drop down icon
you can see all the options selected
right the central east west south every
everything right but now we just want
West one so click on West and select
okay there you go so you have everything
from the west region now let's imagine
that you wanted to look into uh office
supplies only or technology only right
you can do the same with technology and
press OK and now you'll have all the
technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel or that's how you add
filters in Excel having said that if you
are an aspiring data analyst looking for
online x-ray certification from the
expert universities and in collaboration
with real-time industry experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
in collaboration with IBM from the
Purdue University should be the right
choice for more details on this course
please click the link in the description
box below
now we are on our Excel sheet and as you
can see on my screen there is some data
available on the Excel spreadsheet and
this table is not just any table this
table from Microsoft Excel has been
converted into an actual table as you
know by default Excel considers all the
data which has been inserted into the
spreadsheet as a database and to
implement this slices in Excel we might
want to create or convert the format of
database into a normal table for that
you can select all your data and just
press Ctrl T and that will allow you an
option called convert the data into
table
now since this table is already
converted as a table we can directly
start implementing or inserting slices
into the spreadsheet
now for that select all your data
then go into the insert option
and in the insert ribbon you can see the
filters group and in the filters group
select the option called slicer now you
will be provided with multiple options
since we have the columns employee ID
employee name Zone designation
Department salary employees date of
birth and employees date of Journey so
we can choose any of the options
available according to our columns and
create the slices now let me select the
first one that is Zone next designation
department and let's also select
employee name
now press OK and there you go we have
our slices
now let's try to rearrange these slices
all you can do is just select and drag
them up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the East Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony Banner Fred Etc
and their Department designation etc etc
all on one single screen so this really
helps you while you're presenting your
data in a presentation now for a change
let's try to select the department now
if your client wants to select the data
from only analytics Department then you
might want to select on the analytics
key on the department slicer and there
you go you have an employee called look
hops who works in the East Zone and his
department is analytics and his
resignation is contract based and the
salary he is getting is 65
000.
now similarly
uh you can see that we have only
selected analytics and your client also
wants data from it support now you can
see that analytics is gone
but what if we want both analytics and
ID support then you have an option
called selected multiple then you can
select analytics and ID support and if
you want HR you can also do that and in
this Zone if you want West along with
East then you can do the same east and
west and you have all the employee
details and in the designation let's try
to Select Senior trainee okay select
multiple senior trainee and manager so
that's how you do it
so that's how it's done and that's how
you implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation now you
can see the PDF document which I am
looking to convert from PDF to excel so
this particular PDF document has a table
so this is the statewise jst collections
that happen during March of 2020. now we
need to convert this tabular data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this
so now we are at the blank workbook and
the complete sheet is empty now let's go
into the data option in the toolbar
and in the data option of the toolbar
we have
the ribbon of get and transform data in
this ribbon you can see get data option
select that and you can see various
options here from file from database
from Azure from other sources Etc
now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a drop
down and in that drop down you might
want to select the PDF if you have a
Json file you can also choose from a
Json and if you have the data from XML
you can choose that and even you can
extract the data from text or CSE as
well now we need the PDF option so
select the PDF Now navigate where your
file is existing so my file is on the
desktop and now let me select the PDF
document
select import now Excel will
automatically analyze the itability data
in the PDF format and give you the
results
now according to excel there are
multiple tabular formats table 1 table 2
so basically this table is one and the
same so all the 29 states are fixed in
one table itself but since the PDF is
divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table 1 table
2 and there are few more tables which
Excel is assuming that it might be table
but it's not and another table which is
page number zero zero two it has a table
and another one is right here now there
is an option of selecting all the tables
all together at once or you can select
only one table which you want to select
so if you select multiple items Excel
will automatically give you an option of
choosing your tables you can just take
and select the tables you want
or
you can directly select the table you
want on your Excel sheet
so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting one
two four and five and this particular
one is not a table so I'm eliminating
that now you might want to choose the
load option
so Excel is now loading the data
now all the data has been successfully
loaded
now
yeah it is giving us a notification that
all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load 2. and
here
select table option and if you want the
data to be you know loaded to a new
worksheet you can choose that and select
ok
now you can see all the data has been
successfully loaded in the form of
tabular format in the new Excel sheet
similarly let's try to load another page
in the table format
new worksheet
select ok
and the third sheet
now get ready to impress your boss by
converting all the PDF data into Excel
sheet just in a matter of few seconds
with few steps
and there you go all the four tables
have been loaded successfully in the
form of excel in just a few steps how to
add Watermark to excel now on my sheet
you can see some data so here we wanted
to add some Watermark logo to your Excel
spreadsheet so that it looks genuine and
work by you right so that's the overall
idea of adding a watermark now go to the
insert window and in the insert window
go to the text option click on that
select header and footer once you select
header and photo you can see something
on your screen like this so in this box
which is highlighted by a cursor is why
you're going to add the picture on my
top in the menu bar you can see header
and footer elements in this select the
picture element and it will navigate to
you to a different option window since
we are adding the image from our local
system select from file or if you are
adding from your Bing or any search
window you can also add that or OneDrive
as well but now let's go with from file
it will directly navigate you to the
pictures folder in your local system so
here is my simply launch logo click on
it and select answer now you can see the
images added in this format which is
Ampersand and picture and you might
wonder where is the picture it is
actually present to view it click on any
cell in the spreadsheet and there you go
you can see it now you might be
wondering the image is a little towards
top and abnormally placed right so no
worries you can always you know format
your picture just press enter and use
enter to move your picture towards the
center of your data spreadsheet and also
there is another option of format
picture altogether here you can adjust
the height and width of your image by
you know increasing and decreasing width
or increasing and decreasing height
using the arrow marks also works and
apart from this there is another option
of picture formatting where you can
choose your image to be washing out
black and white grayscale or anything so
currently I am going with automatic
which will automatically adjust the
brightness and you know everything for
your image it looks perfectly fine so
click on OK and there you go right so
now
this should be fine
right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to normal
you might be confused right where is
Hello going to vanish did I have to save
it no it's already saved everything is
fine even the image is there but you
cannot see it in normal view to see it
click on file click on print then you
can see the logo it will be present only
on the printed Pages not on the normal
view okay so that's how you work with
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel so conditional formatting is
a method to visualize your worksheet we
already have the charts in Excel to
visualize our Excel sheets in graphical
form but what if you had to see or
visualize the data in your worksheet as
it is so that is where the condition
formatting comes handy now let's get
back to the Microsoft Excel and try to
implement some conditional formatting
now we are on the Excel worksheet this
particular data set is based on a store
now we have various columns in this
particular data set we have row ID order
ID customer name Etc and finally we have
quantity discount and profits now let's
go to profits let us imagine that we
have provided this particular store with
a target of minimum 15 percent profits
now let us find out the stores that have
hit the 15 Target and the ones which did
not so for that let us select the entire
column now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home toolbar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the conditional formatting
option click on that
and you have various options over here
highlighting the cells top bottom rules
data bars data scales and icons so data
bars are actually the bar graphs which
highlight themselves on each and every
cell if you implement them and these are
the color skates if you want to
implement some colors you can go through
that and if you want to represent
yourselves when icons you can also do
that for now let's highlight the cells
so select that and inside this select
the greater than option and here you can
provide the percentage that is 15
percent
and the cells or the stores which hit
the target should be highlighted with
the green color and select OK and there
you go you have your stores that hit the
15 Target and the ones which did not hit
the 15 Target now if we want to
highlight the ones which did not hit the
15 Target you can highlight them with
the color thread
so
conditional formatting highlight the
cells less than 15 percent with color
red and text dark
and there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that their 11
0 is indicated that they are not alive
now let us use this column and
conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color green
okay
and
highlight the cells
that contain text 0 as the red that
indicates they are not alive
and let us select the icons
now we have the icons over here the X
indicates that they are not alive and
the green check mark indicates that they
are alive
now that is how you use conditional
formatting in Excel so to understand the
pitch setup in Ms Excel we will go
through a demo inventory in Excel where
we'll be considering some restaurant
data
now without any delay let's get started
with the Practical demo now we are on
the Excel sheet and this is the data I
was talking about the restaurant data
where we have the First Column that is
Rank and next we have the restaurant
name followed by that we have the sales
happening through that restaurant and
then we have the segment category that
is what kind of service does that
particular restaurant offers now this is
the list what we made and what if we
wanted to represent this data and form
of a printed paper right so I guess you
can see all the columns and rows here so
you can see that we have almost like 250
rows so there is no chance or there is
no way to print all those 250 rows in
one page of course it is practically
possible but when you try to read the
content it'll be so tough to read
Because all the rows will be clubbed
together so closely so that you cannot
read it so you need to print them Page
by page so and you need to also take
care of the data is aligned properly
according to the page size everything
and even you need to take care of the
margins of your page right so that's
what page setup basically means
so we had a detailed overview of our
data and what actually we are trying to
make now let us see how page setup is
possible in Ms Excel so to go to the
page setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print option
and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here
and you can also go to print menu by
pressing a shortcut method that is Ctrl
p
so you'll directly end up on the page
setup options now let's look at the
second method so the second method is
you can see the toolbar over here right
which has file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so the second method we can use
page layout option from the toolbar and
you can see when you click on the page
option from the toolbar you have a new
ribbon over here so this ribbon is all
about page setup options so it will
offer you margins it will offer you
orientation size print area breaks
background printiles etc etc right so
all these options are menus in this
ribbon belong to page setup now let us
look at the third method so the third
method is something similar you have
view option on the toolbar so just
select a view and you can see we have
few page setup options over here as well
the normal page break page layout custom
views and we have gridlines formula bar
heading zoom and zoom out select to zoom
free certain panes right so all these
are also the page setup options so we
have the three methods to enter the page
setup options now we are from earlier
with those now let's get started with
the Practical mode on page setup for
that let me use the simplest method that
is holding the control key and pressing
P which navigates me to the print option
now we have various set of options here
we have no scaling normal margins letter
portrait orientation collated print
active sheets and Node 1 for Windows you
can see this option is a printers option
for example if you are connected to a
printer which is the hardware printer
then your Ms Excel will show the
printer's name here so other than
printer you can also make some other
arrangements where you can just directly
print your complete data in the form of
PDF and then you can export your PDF to
your recipient that's also possible okay
now let's get started with the first
option that is print active pages okay
to understand this better we need to
create a new sheet not a problem
so you can see that we just have one
sheet over here
so let us kind of select all the items
and create a new sheet and try to paste
it over here
or let's try to paste it over here
okay now let's try to extend these
should be fine now let's rename this
sheet
sheet
or let's rename it as
restaurant
for our reference now let us get back to
the print sheet option so I'll use the
shortest method that is holding the Ctrl
key and press P now you can see that
here we have six pages in total from the
active sheets so the current active
sheet is the top 250 sheet so this
particular sheet is the current active
sheet so if we print the entire data in
this particular sheet then we will end
up printing six pages now let us select
the other option where you have to print
the entire workbook
right so now you can see that there is a
change in the number that is 12 pages so
what is a workbook so basically workbook
is the collection of entire sheets in
your Excel home page so in this
particular Excel homepage you have the
first sheet that is top 250 and the
second sheet that is the restaurant
sheet 2 right so the combination of
these two sheets make up a workbook
so when you select the entire workbook
option you'll have 12 pages so that's
how we use this setting where you select
the active sheets the entire workbook
and there is another option where you
can only print a selected item so if you
want to do this then let's get back here
now what if your customer or what if
your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so you can select the
top 10 restaurants
bye
doing this
now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to print
so you can see Excel has automatically
selected the selection only print the
selected content only so you can see we
have only the top 10 restaurants or top
11 restaurants that we have selected in
our sheet and it is ready to get printed
so this is how we use the first option
now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is collated
right so in collated you have different
different options that is one two three
one two three and one two three and the
next one which is uncolated one one one
two two two three three three so why are
these numbers uh present here and what
does collected mean anyway so this is a
question right now the answer for this
question will be a little similar to
your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invisilator and you have
10 students in your room
so you wanted to provide question papers
to all the 10 students okay so you have
your question paper distributed into
three sheets that is you have marked
questions and your questions are fit
into three papers right in this scenario
we have 250 rows and all the data is
split into six sheets that is sheet 1 or
page 1 page two page 3 page four right
now if we wanted to print 10 copies then
the arrangement of papers will be page 1
page 2 page three page 4 page five page
six in continuous order right that is
collated if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that particular
approach is called uncollated approach
and if you are printing the pages in
continuous order for 10 times then that
particular approach is called as
correlated approach so this is what we
had to learn about collated and
uncolated now let's get back to the
third option
now let's press again print now we have
our data over here
there is something wrong
select all the elements Ctrl V yeah now
we have our data pack now we have the
third option that is the portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a
picture in your phone we have two modes
as well that is portrait mode and the
landscape mode so when you click on the
portrait mode this is how your data will
be looking now to understand the
difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use the page orientation for now let's
keep the page orientation as portrait
orientation
and we have now the fourth option so
what is the fourth option we have
various sets of options in here that is
letter and A4 size there are also some
more page options over here where you
can select the page types you want to
print
so basically you'll be having few more
options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but here we
just have two that is A4 and letter so
basically you'll get those options and
followed by that next we have margins so
here you can see we don't have any
margins for our data okay so now we can
add some margins by setting up this one
as an option like last custom setting or
you can also choose normal wide narrow
right so your page will be changed
according to your margin size
right so this is how you can change the
margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the
normal one
now we have the next option that is
scaling option
so here you can see we are trying to fit
the page so when you're trying to print
these sheets using no scaling then the
actual size of the page will be printed
now you can also modify that you can fit
and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print
now if you wanted to print the all the
six pages into the PDF format and mail
it to your client you can also do that I
think I have explained it in the first
place so you can see we can do it by
just selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your client
and you can also select the number of
copies you want you can increase the
copies to two three and any number of
copies you want for now I'll keep it as
one copy
[Music]
now let's print this
now let us select the
location
rename it and publish
now let's get back to documents and see
if the page is printed or not
here we go here we have the restaurant
data in the form of PDF
so we have our entire six pages of data
in the PDF format
now we are back on the home page now we
have some limited functions in the print
functions over here
we have tried to export the data so you
can also export the data or try to print
it from the print option over here you
can just select that as well
you need a new file
PDF
yes the pages are printed now
and then we have the restaurant to PDF
data
so that's how you can print all your
data you can either choose
the export option or you can either
choose the print option now when you see
into the print option we have limited
number of page setup options over here
now let's check out what we missed so we
are in the page layout here so we had
gone through the margins we had set all
the margins and then we have also gone
through the portrait and landscape now
you can see this size when we were in
the print menu option we had only A4 and
letter but here you can see there are a
wide variety of options that is other
than later we have tabloid legal
statement executive A3 right we have A5
and many more other options and if you
want some more paper options you can go
to more and you can always select few
more options that's how you do it and
yeah we didn't had the break option so
remember when we had been through the
print option we did not have the break
option there
let's select this to normal A4 so you
cannot see the break option over here
right so here we have the brick option
so what does break option does right you
can actually break the page remember we
spoke about the top 10 things or the top
10 rows you can always do that so you
can just keep the top 10 restaurants in
your first page and then break the
remaining and the set page breaks you
can select the cell now I need the top
10 so I'll select this particular cell
which is in the 11th position
and now I'll try to implement the page
break insert a page break and now you
can see on my sheet there is a thin line
which is separating the two pages that's
how you can see the indication of app
page break implemented onto your page
now how do you see it you can see it by
selecting Ctrl P where you can see the
first top 10 restaurants being printed
on your sheet so there you go we have
the first top 10 restaurants printed on
our sheets so that's how you use the
page break
now let's try to eliminate all the page
tricks so you can select clicks and
reset all page clicks so the page break
has been eliminated
now you can always choose a background
for your data as well you just if you
want you can add a picture to your
background I think that's not
available for now
okay you can work offline as well let us
select this one
so you can see that we have added a
background to our data
we can select all the text files and
then you can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible
yeah that's how you do it now if you
don't want the image to be added on your
file you can also remove that delete
page background and there you go all the
images are gone
now the next important part that is the
print titles
now why do we need print titles for that
let's try to print this
so now you can see the first page in the
first page we have the title rank
restaurant sales segment category but if
you go to the second page you don't have
that title right you don't have the
title rank name of the restaurant sales
and their service category so if we want
that then we need to add Titans
now for that let's select the print
titles option now let's select the rows
to repeat on top
now for that we need the first row
select the first row and this particular
row will be repeating into all the pages
now let's try to print it
so yeah now you can see the titles are
being added to all the sheets you can
see the page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5 and
page six so you can see the title is
added to all the sheets
so that's how USD print titles option
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand name so
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
an image into an Excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image of files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets is completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the islands
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures button click on that
and select from this device or if you
have an online stock image you can take
that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this device
and here I have some images the images
what we need are simply learn and simply
code logos press ok
or insert so here you have them
now
you can also adjust the size of the
image using the small buttons here
pass it over here
and done
so you might be wondering is it all done
is there anything more to do or just
adding an image is done no most of the
times when you create or you work with
Excel spreadsheet you will not just you
know add some data and add a relevant
image to it most of the time you add
some graphs or you most of the time you
will add some charts to showcase the
data dashboard right so it will be
something like this so this is how you
add the image or graph onto your
dashboard and sometimes you might not
have enough place to display your entire
dashboard during those situations what
you do is you try to hide the row or
column so now let's try to hide this
particular room let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh to uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four has been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image then you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture format
or you can also right click and directly
navigate to picture format this opens up
a set of options and here you might want
to go to the third one which is picture
format third and select the properties
I'm here select the option of move and
size with cells so when you select this
when you try to hide this it will also I
mean the graph or the image will also
hide along with the row so that's how
you do it I think is something which is
clickable and when you click on it it
will redirect you to a different web
page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel
now creating a hyperlink is really
simple we have multiple ways now let's
write some text on the Excel worksheet
I'll write simply down
now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding Ctrl key and
pressing k
now this will enable the hyperlink menu
box or the dialog box this is the first
way and let me close it now again we
have selected the cell there is another
option where you have to click on the
insert menu on the toolbar and navigate
to Links group click on the link option
and you will again have the dialog box
of the hyperlick in Excel and the Third
Way is right click on the cell and you
can see the link option in the last
and this will enable the hyperlink
option in Excel now let's create a
hyperlink the simplest way again Ctrl K
now we have a variety of options that is
existing file or web page placed in this
document create a new document and an
email address so we will address all of
these one at each time so first one
existing file or a web page now you can
select an existing PDF file or any file
in your local system and hyperlink or
create a hyperlink to the text or you
can select a website a link and place it
over here and create it as a hyperlink
let's explore both the options
first let's try to explore the web page
option so since I have written as simply
learn let's use the website link of
Simply learn and create a hyperlink
let me open Google
Newton and let me type simplylearn.com
let me copy the hyperlink and now let's
get back to the Excel workbook now here
let's place the hyperlink now you can
press ok
and there you go the hyperlink has been
successfully created now this link is
clickable when you click on it it will
redirect you to a new simply launch home
web page right so this is how you create
a hyperlink to a website
now we shall explore another option that
is using an existing file right let's
create a new text box here let's name it
as existing
file and okay existing file should be
good
again the same you can either click uh
you know right click and select
hyperlink or Ctrl k
now let's select existing file or web
page option now here you can see
navigate key press on that and let's
navigate the files
let's select all fancy here remember to
select all files okay by default it
shows as office files now let's explore
our file option
so let's select a fundamentals of
computer programming option which is a
PDF file press OK and there you go we
have created a hyperlink so when I click
on this you can directly navigate to an
existing PDF file in your local system
and it will be open as a web page
click on it and you can see the PDF file
now close
now another thing when you navigate onto
this you'll see the lengthier HTTP
address and same happens here right so
if you're a little uncomfortable
watching this lengthier link you can
also edit it you can choose the option
of edit hyperlink
and
see the screen tip option
click on it
and here you can change the text to
display option
and write it as
click here
to no more
press ok
again press OK and now if you navigate
onto it instead of seeing a Lambda
hyperlink what you can see is click here
to know more okay I think I made a
spelling mistake
so I think I forgot an e
somewhere over here yes click here to
normal
and press OK right so here you can see
click here to normal let's try this
again over here
so edit
edit hyperlink screen tab option and
instead of the lender your text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes
or PDF
click ok
and click another okay and you are done
so instead of seeing that length via
hyperlink you can see click here to open
PDF right so so far we have explored two
options that is existing file and
existing web page
right now let's try to explore another
option again a hyperlink right click
hyperlink and here you have seen places
in document all right so which is like
uh okay let me
show this to you instead of telling you
so here what it is doing is you have to
sell A5 and you wanted to refer to A1 or
any other cell in the same worksheet so
you can do that right so now for your
reference let me cancel it and let me
create a new sheet and here
navigate me to here right let me write
this navigate me to here
okay
so now what we will do is so here we
will create that navigate link
from using the hyperlink option place
this in this document you can see the
sheet to option and the cell references
A1 where we have written navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell
okay let me also rename it
write it as navigate cell navigating
cell
right now
to create that
Ctrl k
let me select sheet 2 and the cell
address is A1 press ok now what did what
what's the change right when you click
on this you will be redirected to sheet
to cell A1 navigate me to here right so
this can be like a shortcut when you
have multiple sheets like 100 sheets
then you can you know have yourself a
different column over here and add the
navigation address to all those cell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case I have given
sheet to address cell A1 right so this
is another trick now let's get back to
the hyperlink thing again uh Ctrl K and
another option is create new document so
you might have been through you know
option of uh having
let's say some cheat sheets or clip-on
clipboards right so let us imagine that
you're walking through a huge worksheet
and you wanted to you know have a track
of everything and keep notes updating
right so it might be a little
complicated to understand so let me show
it practically so let me write it down
as clipboard or sticky note
okay I think this has a hyperlink let us
okay this can't be used no worries
back to
uh hyperlink option again
create new document
now here you can create a variety of
documents right so it can be a text
document it can be an Excel document it
can be a PDF document right for now
we'll create a text document okay uh
we'll name it as a Tracker
Dot txt
so this should create as a text document
and the location can be anything so you
can you know take it as a desktop
documents download so let me take
documents here and select ok so I'll be
having this tracker.txt located in the
documents folder
and you can also choose to edit our
document later or edit the document now
let us select edit the document now
press OK and there you go so you have
your text tracker here so let us imagine
that we have worked on the Excel sheet
and we wanted to write down as a sticky
note so that we can remember what we
have done on the Excel sheet so update
one
and update to now we can close it so
it'll ask for a save option save it and
done and let us imagine that you did
something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I'm in
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a miner notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update 3 what you have
written right in the latest update what
we have
foreign
so that's how you keep track of your
sticky note and you'll have all your
updates right
now getting back to the hyperlinks again
the last one is email address
so you can also try to add okay let's
imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send them out an email
right so it would be a little time
consuming that you open your email and
compose something and send it over here
but what if you had a one single click
and access to the email compose option
right that can be done so let us write
down email
actually
let me with the spelling
so again the Ctrl K and hyperlink select
email option and you can write down your
email
which can be anything so you can write
down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here
friend gmail.com and
you can write the subject about update
and press OK this will navigate you to
the Gmail option or the mailing address
options
click on it and you'll have a variety of
mailing options Outlook Office 365 Yahoo
iCloud Google Etc so you can select any
one of those since we have written as
gmail.com we'll navigate to Gmail and
all you have to do is log in you know
all the formalities and you're good to
go with emailing
so let's get this one now so yeah you
know how to do the rest parts
so so far we have you know covered all
the hyperlink options in Excel that has
existing file or a web page place this
in the current executive worksheet or
document creating a new document for
your update thing and also including the
email right so so far we have covered
everything around happening in Excel and
if you have anything to know more about
or if you feel that we have missed out
anything important regarding hyperlink
in Excel how to calculate time
difference between two different timings
using Excel now let's get on to the
Practical mode now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet as you can see on my Excel
spreadsheet let me expand it
we have two different timings that is in
and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the end
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the AM PM so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24 hour timing that is 1320 1330 so
this represents the 24 hour format
but since we are you know working on
Office timings let's keep it as AM PM
okay so there you go so we have our
timings of in and out now to calculate
the time difference between the in time
and out time so this particular
calculation is completely simple all you
have to do is press equals to select out
time minus select end time so there you
go press enter and you have the total
number of hours the employee has been
working in your organization so here
also we have made some minor cell
formatting so usually it comes out as Am
Pm right but instead of that we have
made a minor cell formatting we have
navigated into time and we have selected
the 24 hour formatting so that we have
just ours in our output so that's how we
have calculated the time difference
between two n times and out times of an
employee using Excel now with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to calculate time difference using
that is how to freeze rows in Excel now
we might want to start our practical
mode So currently we are on Excel and
this is a spreadsheet data
so here you can see columns and rows so
especially the fourth row and the column
C right so uh currently we have data on
our spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you will have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if even
even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when you scroll
this and keep that data set on the
column as it is right so we can also do
that let's look at both of them so there
is a simple process to do that all you
have to do is select the cell or for
which you want to you know set
So currently you want to let me expand
it so currently I want to freeze this
particular row right and this particular
column so the cell I would be selecting
yes the first cell here that is D5
right so when I select this particular
cell I can be able to freeze this
particular row and this particular
column
so now you need to navigate to the
toolbar and then select the view menu
and inside view option you can see there
is an option of freeze paints right so
click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is the second option
or you can freeze the entire column that
is the third option or you can freeze
both that is the first option right
freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully Frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel so with that we
have component of this tutorial on how
to freeze raw or how to freeze columns
or how to freeze both the pins in Excel
spreadsheet we are on our Excel
spreadsheet now creating a pivot table
is just away from a few clicks trust me
it's just a couple of clicks and you'll
have your pivot table ready to operate
now click any cell or select any cell on
your spreadsheet which has the data and
navigate to insert menu on the toolbar
and select pivot table and that's how
simple it is now automatically Excel
will choose your data you can see the
lines over here dotted line that means
the Excel has already selected the range
of data that you want to put into your
pivot table and you can either select
the existing worksheet or a new
worksheet I'll select a new worksheet
over here and just press on OK and there
you go you have your pivot table ready
now here you can see your pivot table is
a little empty all you need to do is
drag and drop the data elements that you
want on your pivot table so here you can
see on a spreadsheet we have some
business data related to a store which
has furniture and states and
subcategories of the furniture and all
the you know in in category you have
furniture officer plus technology Etc
right so those have some sub categories
as well and different states and the
regions as well and the quantity total
sales happen right so using this
business data we can find out some key
insights of this particular data using
our pivot table right so here we'll add
the data now let me drag the region into
rows click and drag and let me drag a
categories into columns which are the
different categories which are involved
in sales data and values what are the
sales happened right and there you go
you have Furnitures of a supplies
technology as the three different
categories and those are the sales
happened in central is South and West
regions and this is the grand total and
incentive regions you know you have all
the regions over here right so Central
is Southwest or instead of uh all the
regions or instead of all the categories
you can you know placed a specific
category in your pivot table for example
let me push the category into the
filters and here you can see the total
sales happen in those particular regions
now what if someone asks you to find the
sales of Only Furniture right so your
manager comes to you and he'll ask you
getting the sales of only Furnitures you
can select that and there you go you
have the furniture sales in all the
regions right or you can also do the
vice versa he can also drag regions into
the filters and if you wanted to find
out the region wise sales of furniture
you can also do that right
so here we have furniture and here you
have all the regions and let us try to
find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how the pivot table works and
you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filters or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have
categories on our you know columns so
you can also include sub categories into
the columns
right and
and you have the reason why sales
show in the region filter select all
press OK and in the category
select all
press ok
and you have the furniture here of a
supplies here and Technology here and
also if you want to include the quantity
how much or how many number of uh you
know things got sold in those particular
categories and subcategories you can
also do that so here in the furniture
section books these are the sales and
these are the number of quantity or
elements sold in the in those particular
you know sectors so you can you can also
improve the level of granularity you can
also include the level of detail using
pivot tables in Excel having said that
if you are an aspiring data analyst
looking for online x-ray certification
from the expert universities and in
collaboration with real-time industry
experts then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in data
analytics in collaboration with IBM from
the Purdue University should be the
right choice for more details on this
course please click the link in the
description box below
now here we have four different sheets
of the seals so the first sheet is the
West Zone next is South Zone a Zone and
central zone so all this data belongs to
one single sheet that is Superstore data
set so I have categorized or I have
taken a part of the data which belongs
to central region South Region west
region and east region now we are going
to use all these four sheets and create
one single sheet which is the pivot
table of all the four sheets now without
further Ado let's start the process now
for that we might want to use the
shortcut key that is alt D now press P
now this starts the pivot chart wizard
now here we have to choose the option
multiple consolidation ranges
then click on next
and here you can see the pivot table is
clicked by default
now we'll go to next now here click I
will create page Fields or the pivot
chart wizard will automatically create
if you want that to create for you now
click on next now here let's select the
range
now I'll be selecting the range
now next we'll Select East
okay
followed by that we have South
and finally we have best
now we will name these according to the
regions
so the first one will be West
one will be South
1 will be East
and the last one will be Central
click on next and here select new
worksheet and finish
and there you go you have the pivot
table here now you might want to change
the summation value
so click anywhere on the pivot table and
change it from count to
sum
so that you have the summation of the
total number of sales subcategory sales
and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here you can see the
furniture office supplies technology and
the grand total all in one single sheet
now let's get back to the original sheet
so as you can see this is the original
sheet and in the original sheet you can
see various more categories
which is the
which is the shipment mode customer
segment country city state
and you also have product name
subcategory Etc so if you had added all
these into this sheet you can also
create a separate option of adding my
new details to your pivot table
so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets so how to
create a paper chart you ask it is
really simple all you need to do is just
follow few steps and you have your
favorite chart ready which is completely
interactive now all you have to do is
select any cell in the data set you have
and rush into the insert toolbar then in
the group of charts you have an option
called pivot chart select on it now
you'll be asked to select the data range
and you can see Excel has automatically
select all the range that you want to
include in your pivot chart then you
have another option which is asking you
to either create the pivot chart in the
current worksheet or a new worksheet for
now let's select a new worksheet and
there you go voila the paper chart is
completely ready you might ask me this
is completely empty yes the default
pivot chart what you get from Excel will
be completely empty but you can add the
Legends and all the data that you want
to add onto your pivot chart just by
dragging and dropping the data from the
right hand side of your Excel sheet that
is from the pivot chart Fields so you
can see we have various options region
category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add region
I'll add region to access
and comparatively we will see the sales
that are happening in those particular
regions by dragging sales into values
now you have all the data in the form of
pivot chart which is completely
interactive which represents the sales
happening in those regions now you can
also select a particular region right by
default all the regions are selected but
if you want to select only Central then
you can do that by deserting everything
and select only Central and select OK
and there you go you have all the data
related to the sales happening in the
central region now if you want to you
know kind of see all the categories of
sales happening in all the regions you
can drag the category into values again
and in the region part
okay I think we have to add category
into Legends yes now select a region
slab that is all regions and select OK
and you can see the category wise sales
in all the regions at one single go and
I hope you did not observe it clearly uh
the Excel also gives you the completely
prepared pivot table as well right which
is also interactive you can also get to
choose the data from here as well and
select OK and you'll see that being
reflected on the pivot chart so here you
can see both pivot table and pivot
charts are completely interactive now we
are on the Microsoft Excel and we have
taken some sample data to make things
look simple so here we are considering a
set of students and their attendance
percentage so we will be using this
particular data and design a progress
tracker
now let us try to increase the size of
the cells
now select all the cells in the
attendance column
now we have selected all the cells in
the attendance column and in the toolbar
select the Home tab and inside the Home
tab you have styles group inside the
Styles group select conditional
formatting and inside the conditional
formatting option select new rule
so in the new rule we want to select the
first option that is format all cells
based on the values
now here you can see format Style
since we are trying to create a data bus
we need to select the option of database
here
and under the data bar options we have
some more options on the drop down menu
so here in the type select number
and
the minimum number is 0 it is
automatically stored here and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as 1.
now here you can select the color for
your pass
now since we have already chosen green
for all the column headers let's choose
blue
and
select ok
now here you can see that the values are
being indicated using bar graphs right
and you can also see the percentage
values but we can make it look a little
more better by shifting them to the left
side and text could be given as white
so that it's more uh vibrant to look at
and now we can also apply some
conditional formatting onto these
attendance columns
so let us try to highlight the students
having attendance less than 65 percent
so highlight cell rules less than
65 percent attendance
with
redcalk select ok
and there you go you have the progress
tracker right on your screen and using
the same principles you can track the
attendance for all the students
and also you can apply some congested
formatting onto all your cells and
highlight the ones which are not on the
track now this is how you can implement
progress trackers using Excel right on
my screen you can see a circular
progress tracker so it is tracking the
percentage of the first student that is
Stacy now let's try to change the marks
of Stacy from engineering subject from
55 to 75
and Engineering subject 4 from 68 to
84 then you can see the percentage is
getting changed and also the same is
getting implemented on the progress
tracker interesting right would you like
to create a similar circular progress
tracker yes that can be done that's
exactly what we're discussing today so
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is circular progress tracker
in Excel
now let's get back to the Practical mode
so let us enter into a duplicate sheet
which has all the marks of the students
so now we are on the duplicate sheet
where we have all these students names
and the marks list and also the
percentage now let us create a new
column which states the actual
percentage minus the overall percentage
so the overall percentage is 100 and the
action percentage is 75 76 and so on
let's try to calculate this or let's try
to convert it into the percentage format
now
let's try to change some values
yeah cool
now let's try to change this yeah we
were supposed to add the percentage
symbol which we forgot now it's
implemented there now let's drag it
again so there you go we have the
remaining percentage as well so we have
the actual percentage and the remaining
percentage so we need both of them to
apply the donut chart so we have
selected both the percentages and now
we'll enter into insert menu then you
can see
um pie chart icon over here click that
and you have a donor chart over here
select that and you have the donut chart
so now let's remove the
symbols which we don't need so we have
removed the details of one and two there
and let's change this to Circular
progress
tracker
so we have removed the Legends and we
have rename the chart name our circular
progress tracker and now let's try to
insert the percentage icon
or the texture so you have the text
chart or text box option over here
select that drag and drop it here
we have the text box here select that go
to the formula bar select equals to and
then select these address cell
there you go you have it now we have the
percentage in the text box now you can
make your edits I'll bring it to Center
alignment to Center
text further to Blue as we have it on
the Outer Circle
and you can change the font you can make
it bold increase the font size
there you go so we have the progress
tracker
okay let's try to group the text box
with the chart so that we can move them
all together
so now you can make some changes and see
if that's working or not so let's make
the change to the engineering subject 1
from 32 to 68 and press enter there you
go the changes have been applied the
percentage got changed to 78 from 72 and
the same has been implemented here and
even the progress chart is also working
on the same way so that's how you create
these circular progress charts in Excel
now at times you might be working on a
really important spreadsheet on your
Excel or you might have the sales data
of your company or some confidential
data of your organization and you might
have shared the file with your junior or
you might face some pocket issue and you
forgot to save or you must to save your
data and what to do if you cannot save
your data and how can you recover it
right so this might be a really big
hassle today we are exactly going to
discuss the same and see how to do it in
multiple ways so Excel comes up with an
option to automatically save the data
also it will try to warn you that your
data is not being saved would you like
me to save it or not right so we'll do
the first one so here you have the auto
save option you can either say ok to it
or you can ignore it in case if you
ignore it if you choose to ignore it or
if you choose to manually save it and
then if you want to close the file
remember we haven't saved the file if
you wish to close it Excel will
automatically come up with a dialog box
asking you want to save your changes to
your data.xlsx
that means it is asking you if I have to
save it or not let's try to ignore this
and forcefully let's try to close it you
can go to task manager option here we
are trying to simulate the option of
Parker tissues
so we are forcefully closing Excel
without saving any data
so we have closed it now here you can
see we do not have Excel running in the
background now when you directly open or
try to start Excel when you get the
power backup again and if you want to
open that same data file it will ask you
the document recovery option it says you
have close the file without saving the
changes and you can choose to you know
come back from the same place where we
left last time okay now that was the
Parker tissue and now let's see uh
another way okay let's imagine that
somebody
eliminated a few important data files
from your organization's confidential
data employee ID employee name Etc and
again let's simulate the force uh close
of the Excel
now we are closing it again without
saving no data was being saved
now it will also ask the same data it
has another version here the original
one which wasn't saved so here you can
recover the same file again however it
was initially so you can save it and it
will get back to the original place
so this was one way also we have another
few multiple ways just we have to
navigate to file and here you can open
and in the open menu you have a button
called recover unsaved workbooks not
just the current workbook it will also
have all the remaining files which are
related to excel that are not saved so
here you have a few workbooks which was
not saved this is one option and we also
have another option we can just navigate
to info and there you have another
option called manage workbook and in the
manage workbook you have another option
called recover unsaved workbooks which
will also redirect you to the same file
that is Microsoft Office and set files
and you'll have all the unsaid workbooks
which are related to excel so this is
how you can recover the unsaved data in
Excel using multiple ways first thing
Excel will automatically ask you if you
have to save the file or not and in case
if you forget to save it you can
directly recover it by default by Excel
it will automatically show that some
folder was not saved on the left side of
your Excel spreadsheet by default and in
case if you missed out on that one you
can manually go to file and you can
either choose open option or info option
to recover the unsaid folders from your
default file location from your page see
that as Microsoft Office and saved files
Etc
which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to excel
so first we will understand what exactly
is standard deviation so standard
deviation is a calculated square of
variance now what is variance okay
nothing to worry let us also understand
what is variance
now the next part variance so what is
variance variance is a measure of
variability
it is calculated by taking the average
of squared deviations from the mean now
what are deviations so slowly you can
understand that we are getting into the
topic of statistics and graphs so uh
before getting deep into it let's
understand what is deviation so the
deviation is a measure that is used to
find the difference between the observed
value and the expected value of a
variable in simple terms deviation is
the distance from the center point so
for example when you are going through a
graph so you will be expecting some
value right and if you get some
difference that is above or below the
expected point that is called the
division what is the difference between
the expected point and the obtained
point so that is the deviation now next
is the observed value so the observed
value is the value that you get in real
time unlike the predicted value so now
you might be thinking to calculate
standard deviation we might need a few
more parameters and you're exactly right
so to calculate standard deviation in
Excel you need variance and then you
need deviation and then you need mean
right so all these parameters are
supposed to be calculated first and then
you will be having the final formula to
calculate late standard DB now that we
understood the theoretical and formula
based explanation about standard
deviation it's time we calculate the
standard deviation using one of the most
popular business intelligence tool that
is Microsoft Excel so let's get back to
the Practical mode
so now we are on the Practical mode and
we have some sample data on my screen
right now let me expand it a little bit
yeah there you go
so as discussed before to calculate
standard deviation we might require the
mean variance deviation and deviation
square and then we can calculate the
standard deviation so let's go step by
step so the first one is calculating sum
right so to calculate average we might
need some of all this course so we have
the index values that is 1 to 10 and
scores of each index value that is 1 to
10 right now let's calculate the sum of
all values here press tab to select the
function
select and drag these cells press enter
and then you have this course now you
want number of indexes so clearly you
can see we have 10 but still let's count
them
c o u n t tab space to select and select
the number of cells press enter and you
have count now what's the mean so mean
is simply the average of all the numbers
right so you can either divide the sum
by count or you can simply use the
average function so let's try to use the
average function so that we also have an
idea of how the average function Works
press tab to select it and select all
the cells and press enter now you have
the average or mean value
now we have the mean value and now after
finding the mean value we are supposed
to find out the deviation so remember
the deviation that is the difference
between the obtained value and the
predicted value right so the operand
value is this one which is here in C2
and the predicted value is this one
that is 82.6 that's our mean right
according to formula we're supposed to
eliminate the value of obtained minus
the mean right so select uh the cell
equals to C2
minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter
so that you can freeze the value and
drag the formula across all the cells
now you have the deviation
right
now the next step is to find the sum of
all the deviation numbers so I either
you can apply the sum formula to all
these numbers or you can just drag this
cell over here and the formula will be
automatically copied now similarly the
count function to count all the values
let us drag it and you will have it over
here right now the next step is to find
out the square deviations or the square
of the deviations which is really simple
all you have to do is equals to select
the cell and see that small hat kind of
logo on the number six use that
now into 2 press enter
you have the square
similarly drag the same formula across
all the cells and you will have your
square numbers similarly drag this
summation function over here so you will
have the sum of this and the count
number as well
now comes the final formula
now we have the mean value that is over
here let's color it
and we have the variation Square
now that is which is this one let's
color it in a different shape and we
have deviation as well let's calculate
in a different shape
now we need to find the variance and
after we find the variance the last step
is to count the standard division or
calculate the standard deviation so what
is the formula to calculate the variance
so for variance you need the sum of
deviation Square
divided by total number of values
minus 1.
press enter and that's your variance now
the standard deviation so the standard
deviation is really simple you need to
calculate the
variance to the power of
0.5
and that's your standard deviation
so that's how you calculate standard
deviation in Excel I hope all the
formulas and the explanation was clear
now you can see that I have a sales data
on my worksheet so let us imagine that
your manager asked you to find the
average of sales happening in your
company right so let's navigate to the
bottom most cell and you know write it
down as average here
okay average sales
so here this is a cell where you want to
keep your average right so here we'll be
writing a small formula that is average
and tap to select it now you must select
the array of data right
so this is my adding since average is an
array function and now press enter so
there you go you have the average sales
data that happened in your company so
what is Summits in Excel
now you might want to calculate uh the
total sum of sales right so let us
assume that this is your entire store's
sales data and you wanted to calculate
the entire sum of sales so there is a
sum function in Excel where you just
have to you know select all the cells
and apply some function onto it and
you'll get the sum of all the sales
right so with something like this you
will select all the cells and then
you'll apply assumes function and you'll
get the sum here and average everything
right so this is fine but what if you
just wanted to find the sales that are
happening in only western region as you
can see our column f is based on region
so we have four regions South West East
and Central so your manager asks you to
find the sales happening in suppose say
west region so how do you calculate it
would you manually go into each cell and
check if it's Western Calvin that will
be time consuming right so what if you
had a method which could do it for you
just in a matter of few steps or few
clicks right so that's exactly sums so
it will basically add a condition
calculate the sum of sales where the
region is equals to West simple to like
or similar to SQL query right so that is
exactly what we're going to do in Excel
today that is using Summers now let me
add here sales of
west region now in the next cell let's
add a sum X function remember there are
multiple sum functions in Excel so when
you type in sum you can see so many
options based on sum right you just have
some followed by that you have some if
it is just some if not some ifs today we
are concentrating on some F's so not
just sum if we'll go to some F's so
we'll be having an option of placing
multiple if conditions there so let's
also try that more on that later now
let's press tab to select our sum ifs
function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sumifs
we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks stable but
right now it's not in tabular format it
is in the format of database we know
that Microsoft Excel considers its data
as a database by default so to convert
the database into table just click
anywhere on the data and and press Ctrl
T so that you'll have a new dialog box
and it will ask if your table has
headers just make sure that you have
ticked in it our table does have headers
so select ok now our database has been
converted into a perfect table and it's
ready for applying Summers function so
now you can see our database has been
successfully converted into our table
now let's begin with our Summits now
again remember we are using some ifs
here not some if or sum so select some
ifs and press Tab and we have SMS
function now the first step which column
are we looking at what are we finding
out right which is a sum range what sum
do you want for now we need sum of sales
so select the sales column and we have a
simple key function here let's hold Ctrl
again press shift and hold shift
together so we're holding Ctrl and shift
key together and now we are pressing
lower Arrow key once yes the entire
sales column has been selected comma Now
where do you want to look so we want to
look I mean which part of the table you
want to fetch right so this is the
region part we want to fetch right now
so again hold Ctrl and shift together
lower Arrow key the entire column is
selected now the next last part so we
want to look into the both of the
columns that is sales column and region
column now which type of data you want
so for now we want Western type of data
so that is the sales data which is
happening only invest right so we'll
select this cell with the data as first
or you can also manually enter it for
now let's select the data so I'm
selecting this cell F7 which has data as
best right now let's close the
parenthesis and press enter so there you
go you have the sales happening in the
western region now you can also try to
format it in the form of currency so
let's use
dollars since it is based on American
states so let's use dollars so there you
go now we are having the sale state of
West now let's try to copy the same to
all the four cells and for now here
let's type in East
and this can be solved right and this
can be your central
there you go
right now you can also copy the same
formula
and make minor edits to it so here
instead of f8 you can select uh East
so where is East here and press enter so
you have the sales related to East now
let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening invest and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay a fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy this cell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another input here on furniture
right now you wanted to calculate the
sales happening in west region only on
furniture so you can also do that now we
can use the same formula as well just
copy paste the formula here right and
you can add few things here when you try
to add a comma it will automatically
generate the next criterator so it is
expecting that you are looking for
adding another criteria right now which
column you want you want category so
let's select category you want to select
all the cells same track Ctrl shift
lower key and again press comma and you
wanted to select Only Furniture so
select on furniture cell they now press
enter so there you go we successfully
have the sales data from west region
based on category Only Furniture so
that's how you do summers in Excel you
can also add a few more details to it
like in Furniture you can also look only
for tables so here you can see in west
region we have furniture sales data and
we have sales data of West Region based
on furniture which includes only tables
you can also do that using sum as
function in the same way all you have to
do is select the subcategory column and
select the cell which has the data as
tables so this is how you use sum UPS in
Excel and you can see on my screen we
have the sales data of one single
employee in the month of January okay so
this is the sales data of John in
January sales
now let us imagine that we have the same
persons or same Jones data of sales of
all the three months okay so here we
have the sales data of John for January
February and March and you wanted to
Club all these three months and write it
down as quarter one right so let us try
doing it
now you can see that only January is
replaced as quarter one and February and
March are still remaining the same so
let us try to delete them
so we have deleted them and I think now
it looks like uh this is a sales data of
one single quota that is quarter one but
again
quota one is under column B and anyone
who looks at it feels like this data is
of January February and March and all
the quarter one details are only present
in B column but C and D are completely
you know different from this one right
so you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who are presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cell so that all the data
looks relevant and it defines that these
data elements belong to photo one right
so there is enough in Excel to do that
so select all the cells that you want to
merge and going to home button and in
home button get into the alignment group
and select merge and center so you can
do it directly also you have a couple of
more options there is merge and center
merge across merge cells and unmatch so
we'll go through it one by one so first
we'll go through merge and center
so there you go to sales code merge and
it has been aligned into Center
now again if your manager or anyone
Superior to you wants this to be you
know independent like they want it to be
in terms of January February and March
so that they can have access to it and
month-wise so you want to unmatch it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmatch and there
you go you have your data packed in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few cells
there you go
and you have it back right so in a few
situations okay you can also add
reporters so that it looks more relevant
now um you know now let's try to match
the second and margin Center yeah now
again uh let us imagine that you are
going through an appraisal cycle and you
also wanted to add some comments about
the sales happening in your company uh
regarding uh all the employees right so
also we have that here now let me expand
a little bit
yeah okay
so again let's margin Center
now
you wanted to you know you wanted to
take a review of your level one level
two and level three managers so you have
all the three uh rows here but you can
see the cells are not merged and you
wanted to merge every single row so
merging and centering everything row
wise would be a little time consuming I
mean three columns is okay but what if
you had like uh you had to take a review
from
a couple of small manages like five to
ten right or imagine a you wanted to
write some random commands apart from
review you wanted to write some random
comments based on month-wise uh sales or
something like that so it would be time
consuming right so apart from that you
have another option where you you know
select all the cells and come over here
and select the option of merge across
and all the cells will be merged all
together at once and you will be having
those individual rows where you can
write down your reviews like review one
and so on review
2 right so this is how the option of
merge across works and we already have
been through the margin Center and merge
is completely similar to margin Center
so this is how margin Center merge cells
and merge across and unmerge cells and
Excel works so you can see that we have
got started with Microsoft Excel and on
the left hand side we have a simple
table with all the teams in an ID
industry starting from it admin testing
development to client consultant support
we have got everything in this
particular table
now our main idea is to find out the
index of these particular elements for
example if you wanted to find the index
of the element of marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want lookup value and position so on the
right hand side you can see that I've
created two separate columns as lookup
value and positions so in the lookup
value column we will be inserting the
value of which you want to find the
index now
for example let us consider that we want
to find the index value of Team
marketing
so I'll be writing Marketing in this
particular lookup value
now how to find the index value of the
element marketing for that we will be
using the match function in Excel
now after writing the match function you
can see that it is asking for three
different parameters so the first one is
the lookup value second is the lookup
array and lastly we have match type so
lookup value is the value of which you
are trying to find the index that is
marketing this particular cell so we
have selected the lookup value which is
the first one next we have to select the
lookup array that is from which set of
elements you want to find the index so
the set of elements are this it admin
testing the column which we have created
the a column now we have selected the
lookup array and lastly the match type
is it you're looking for less than or is
it you are looking for exact match or is
it greater than match so for now I want
exact match so I will be selecting the
exact match that is 0.
now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is 5. now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing 3 development 4
marketing 5. so that's how you find the
index of a selected element in Excel
now we just have like 10 elements so we
have got the uh writing of the elements
or you know choosing the elements in a
easy way but what if we had like 100
elements right could be a little
different okay so let me put it simple
now you wanted to find the index value
of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and
you missed out a letter A
okay now you're not finding the right
index
to avoid such problems you can always
take the help of data validation in
Excel
that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop down icon here right you can choose
that and here you can see all the teams
that we have created in the left column
right so here I can scroll down and
choose the finance and there you go I
have the index value okay again we need
to copy paste the same match function in
Excel over here
equals to match
lookup value
lookup array
and exact match
so there you go that's how you make use
of data validation in Excel and using
the list you can comprehend all the list
elements in this particular column into
the list of data validation and we can
choose the team whichever you want to
find the index for so this is how you
can make use of match function in Excel
or index match function in Excel
now we are on our spreadsheet and you
can see I have some sample data on my
spreadsheet and it does have some blank
rows
now how do I eliminate these blank rows
so one step is you can you know select
the entire row and try to right click
and delete it
again this sort of method might take us
to get rid of all the blank rows and
most of the time you might end up even
selecting the rows with data in it right
so if I want to select multiple rows
then I'll be selecting some rows with
data as well which might be a little
Troublesome in the future now let's try
to use the easier way now for that go to
the find and select option select the
go to special option and in that select
the blanks option and press ok now hold
Ctrl key and press minus key
and you will have an option of deleting
the cells now select the entire row now
we are selecting the entire rows with
blank data and press OK and the cells
will be shifted now this is simple but
let me show you another example so even
here we have some blank rows but in
between those blank rows for example
take cell 17 or cell D 17 or row 17 we
have some data testing
and here in the employee ID we have some
data in a26
and again in beat 39 we have some data
that is first name
right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data
so we have a simple Logic for it so all
we need to do is add another row which
is to count the number of cells in the
row now that can be count
from here equals to the function is
Count a
let's tab
and
the cells will be from
A2 to G2
press enter now you have 7. so now we
are basically calculating the number of
cells so if you apply the same to the
entire uh data set let's drag it
and there you go so there are certain
places where you find 0 which are
basically the empty columns right now
let's do some formatting if you need
let's try to add filters
Ctrl a Ctrl D and now table will have
filters and headers
now here you can see the drop down icon
click on that now instead of select all
what you can do is Select zero now you
will be highlighted with all the rows
which do not have any data select all
those and press on delete or what you
can do is the same way Ctrl minus
there you go now
clear the filter
now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
are retrained and all the data or all
the cells or all the rows which do not
have any data which are completely blank
they have been eliminated what is Excel
vlookup
vlookup stands for vertical lookup
vlookup lets you search for specific
information in your spreadsheet it
allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same row
vlookup takes advantage of vertically
aligned tables to quickly find data
associated with the value the user
enters now let's look at the syntax to
write a vlookup function so vlookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the Wilco function
so the first argument is called the
lookup value the lookup value represents
the value that you are searching for
next is the table array the table array
represents two or more Columns of
information the third argument is called
the column index number now this
represents the column number in the
table from which the value must be
returned the First Column is 1 the
second column is 2 and so on and then
we have the fourth parameter which is
called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match
so if you want to find an exact match
you need to enter false or 0 meanwhile
if you want an approximate match you
need to enter true or one if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
now let me give you a brief overview on
what's going to be in our demo
so for our demonstration
we'll use a sales data set you can see
the data set on the left
using this data set we'll understand how
vlookup performs an exact and
approximate match we'll see how vlookup
is case insensitive then we'll perform a
wildcard character search
will understand how to handle errors
when a match is not found and finally
you will look at two-way lookups
now here is a small example of how
vlooker works
so we want to find the units sold by
Morgan using the data set on the left
so here you can see I have the data set
it has
some rows and columns so these are the
columns which are order date region
there's a representative column item
units this unit cost and total and from
this table I want to find the units that
were sold by Morgan if you look at the
table at the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan and Morgan
has sold 30 units now I want to find
this value using the vlookup function so
here on the right you can see I have my
lookup value which is Morgan and this is
my vlookup formula and using this
formula I am getting the result as 30.
now let's go to our Excel workbook and
perform all the demos one by one so this
is my Excel workbook that we are going
to use for our demo
and here is the data set we'll be using
now this is the same data set that you
saw a while ago
so this data set has seven columns you
have the order date the region
representative's name item there's units
unit cost and total which is basically
the total or the amount of sales that
was generated
we are going to use a chunk of this data
set and perform our vlookup analysis
so let's see our first example and the
problem we have at hand
let me go to the exact match tab
all right so here
I am going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first
11 rows from the data set you can see
from Row 2
till row 12 is going to be a data set
that we'll use
so we have a question here
we want to find the items sold by
Thomson so here
Thompson is my lookup value which means
looking at Thompson I want to find the
item that is sold
so if you consider our table here you
can see we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil
and I want to get this value which is
pencil using my vlookup function so
let's go ahead and write our vlooker
function
I'll consider this as my lookup value
and here under item I'm going to write
my vlooker formula
to write the vlooker formula I'll write
first equal to
and
I'll write vlookup now if I hit tab it
will auto complete all right now let's
give the parameters so first is going to
be the lookup value which is nothing but
Thomson so I'll just select this cell
which is j17
comma now it's asking to give the table
array so the table array is the table
from which you want to retrieve a value
one thing to keep in mind is that the
value you are looking for should be the
first column of a table and you can
select the table array till the end of
the data set or till the column which
has the value you want to find
so here I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of the item column which is
going to be my table array then I'll
select the column index number so the
column index number is based on the
table array you have selected in this
case my column index number is going to
be 2 because we have selected just two
columns and the value which I am going
to find is in the second column so I'll
give two
comma now the range lookup I am going to
give is false because I want to find an
exact match so either you can hit tab
or you can write 0 which means false
if I close the bracket and hit enter
it will return me the item that Thompson
had sold which is pencil you can verify
from the table that Thompson had sold
pencil all right
now let's try to change the table array
and see what result are we getting so
this time I'll slightly change the table
array so again we are trying to find the
item that Thompson had sold so I'll
write my formula equal to vlookup I'll
hit tab to autocomplete I'll give my
lookup value as Thompson
comma this time I am choosing my table
array starting from the representatives
column till
the end of the data set which is
till p12 again my column index number is
going to be 2 because if you consider
this table array the item column is the
second column in the selected table
array so I am going to write it as 2
comma
the range lookup I want to give as false
because I want to find the exact match
if I close this and hit enter you can
see it has written me the same result
that we saw earlier
now suppose let's say this time I want
to start my table array from the region
column which is this column
so I want to select my table array
starting from the region column now this
is going to show me an error because
your table array should always start
from the lookup value column so if you
consider Thompson as the lookup value
my table array should always start from
the representatives column so let's just
try this example
so I'll write vlookup my lookup value
I'm going to give it as Thompson comma
the table array as I mentioned earlier I
am going to choose from the region
column and let's say I'll select till
the item column give another comma and
this time a column index number is going
to be 3 because since the table array
has three columns and my item column is
the last column so I am going to give my
column index number is 3 comma I want to
get the exact match so I'll give 0 if I
close the bracket and hit enter you can
see it has given me an error
okay now let me just show you another
method to use vlookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under function Library you see we have
an option to select lookup and reference
if I click on this
and if I scroll down below you can see
there's an option
called vlookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give
your lookup value your table array
column index number and the range lookup
under this function arguments dialog box
so here I want to select my lookup value
as
Thompson my table array is going to be
from the representatives column till
let's say the end of the data set
my column index number is going to be 2
I'll write 2 and range lookup I'll write
as false because I want the exact match
if I hit OK you can see
it has given us the exact same result so
this is one of the other ways to use
vlookup in Excel now let's move to the
next sheet which is regarding
approximate match okay so sometimes you
might have cases where you don't have
the lookup value present in the table in
those cases you can tell vlookup to
return an approximate match
now one thing to keep in mind is that
your lookup value columns should always
be sorted in ascending order while
trying to get an approximate match so
here we are going to use this table and
my lookup value column which is going to
be the representatives column is already
sorted in ascending order
and let's see the question we have here
so I want to find the items sold and the
unit cost format so my lookup value is
going to be matte now if you see this
table I don't have the representatives
name matte anywhere in the table now
using an approximate match I want to
find the item and the unit cost so let's
do it
so here under item I'll write my vlooker
formula
so I'll type vlookup I'll hit tab to
complete it
and this time meluco value is going to
be matte so I'll select the cell comma
my table array I'll select
from the representatives column till
in the end of
item column because I want to find the
item value format
I'll give a comma
my column index number as per the table
array is going to be 2
comma my range lookup this time I am
going to give a screw or one so I'll
write 1. close the bracket hit enter
all right it has written me binder was
the item sold by Matt
now let's try to figure out why we look
up returned binder as the item
now let's see you were asked to insert
the name matte to the representative
column in alphabetical order so where
would you place it ideally you should
Place between qvel and Morgan
since this column is already sorted mat
should appear before Morgan and after
cubelle so in an approximate match
vlookup will consider the previous
highest value
in this case the previous highest value
before mat is qvel and hence vlookup
returned the corresponding item
purchased by kevl which is binder now
similarly
if you wanted to find the unit cost
format
again vlookup will return the unit cost
of cubel which is 125. let's just try it
out so I'll write vlookup
my lookup value is matte comma my table
array for this time is going to be from
Representatives column
till the unit cost column I'll consider
I'll give a comma now the column index
number as per the table array is going
to be 4 we'll give another comma and
this time I'll double click true because
I want an approximate match we close the
bracket hit enter you can see it has
written me 125 which is actually
cables unit cost okay we have another
question and this time I want to find
the units sold by Rob now Rob is going
to be my lookup value
if you see the representatives column we
don't have Rob now let's see what
vlookup is going to return as the item
for Rob so I'll write vlookup I'll give
my lookup value as Rob comma my table
array
is going to start from the
representatives column I'll select till
here I'll give a comma my column index
number is 2
we give another comma
I'll double click on true
so close the bracket hit enter you can
see vlookup has returned me pen now
let's understand why vlookup returned
pen for Rob now if you are asked to
insert the representatives name Rob
into this column so ideally Rob would
appear somewhere between Morgan and
Sorvino because
since this is sorted in ascending order
Rob is actually greater than Morgan and
is less than Sorvino so as you know
we look up in an approximate match
Returns the previous highest value which
is Morgan here and the corresponding
item for Morgan is pen and hence we look
up returned pen from Rob all right
now moving to the next sheet
which is another property of vlookup
which tells vlookup always looks to the
right this means that your lookup value
must always be on the left
and the value you are going to find out
should always be to the right of the
table now consider this scenario where
you look up value is on the left in this
case it is the representatives value and
I have taken cervino for an example
and we want to find the order date for
Sorvino now if you consider this table
your lookup value which is sure we know
is actually this column the
representatives column and we are going
to find out the order date so your
representative's name is on the right of
the table and the value we are going to
find out is on the left of the table
now as per the property vlookup only
looks to the right
so if I use the vlookup function for
this example here I'll write vlookup
I'll give my lookup value as sorbino
comma
multiple array I'll consider from the
order date because I want the order date
till
the representatives column I'll give a
comma and this time
my column index number is actually the
first column if I consider my table
array as the first three columns
selected
and my range lookup is going to be false
if I close the bracket hit enter it
returns me an error the reason is
vlookup always looks to the right and
this time the value we were trying to
find out was to the left of the table
now
if you consider
the opposite case suppose you have the
order date and you want to find the
representative's name you can do that
easily because you lookup value which is
the order date is on the left and your
representatives column is on the right
so let's just try this I'll write
vlookup my lookup value is going to be
sorvino's order date so I'll select it
from the table
I'll give a comma my table array will
start from the G column let's say I'll
select the entire table
comma and my column index number will be
3 if you consider these as my table
array
comma my range lookup is zero if I close
this hit enter you can see we have got
Sorvino corresponding to the order date
all right now let's move to the next tab
now this tab says vlookup returns only
the first match so we have a question at
hand the question is
find the units sold by Jardine
if you see this table
we have the representatives name Jardin
twice you see here and if you look down
we have Jarred in here as well but the
items sold by Jardin at the first
instance is pencil and at the second
instance it's desk
now as per the property vlookup always
returns the first match now ideally when
we write the vlookup function and look
for the units sold by Jardine you will
see vlookup will return
36 instead of 3. let's just try it out
I'll write the vlookup function
my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array
I'll select from the representatives
column till the end of
units column
we'll give a comma by column index
number based on the table array is three
I'll give another comma Now I want the
exact match so I'll select 0
close the bracket and hit enter
now as you can see it returns me the
first match of Jardine which is 36 so
vlookup did not consider the second
match
similarly
if you consider this table
we have zones repeated Thrice so you
have zones here
you have Jones
here for the second time and also we
have zones for the third time and let's
say you want to find the unit cost for
Jones so if I write the vlookup function
I'll consider my
look up value as Jones comma my table
array
I'll select from the representatives
column till the end of unit cost column
I'll give a comma based on the table
array my unit cost column is at the
fourth index so I'll write 4 comma the
range lookup is 0.
if I click on this
and hit enter you can see it here
vlookup has returned the first instance
of Jones and it did not consider the
second and the third instance so our
unit cost
for Jones is 1.99 because vlookup only
Returns the first match
okay moving ahead to the next example we
have here is vlookup is case insensitive
if you consider this table
I've added another
Row in green
so if you see here I have a
representative name called Gill which is
in proper case or
popularly known as sentence case here I
have added Gill's name in
capital letters or all in uppercase so I
want to find the total revenue generated
by Gill the total revenue is basically
the total column
let's do it I'll write vlookup
my lookup value is Dil which is actually
in upper case
I'll consider my table array from the
representatives column till the end of
total column or the sales column
based on the selection my column index
number is 5.
comma the range lookup is false so I'll
just double click on false
if we close the bracket hit enter
you can see it here
our vlookup function has returned the
total as
539.73 which is actually
the value for this row so clearly
vlookup did not consider Gill
which was present at the bottom of the
table in upper case
so this shows that vlookup is clearly
case insensitive
all right
now moving to the next example the
vlookup function supports wild cards
which makes it possible to perform a
partial match on a lookup value for
instance you can use vlookup to retrieve
values from a table after typing only
part of a lookup value to use wild cards
with vlookup you must specify the exact
match by giving false or 0 for the last
argument that is range lookup now we
have a question here
I want to know how much sales did the
representative whose name starts with Ki
make now here sales represents the total
column actually
so I want to find out the person whose
name starts with Ki
so if you consider the representative
column I have one representative whose
name starts with Ki that is key well so
using Ki as my lookup value I want to
find the total so let me show you how to
use wildcard characters and find the
value using vlookup
so write my function vlookup
okay now in lookup value I'll give Ki
after that I am going to write Ampersand
followed by
double inverted commas
then I'm going to write a star and close
the inverted comma this means the value
starts with k i
Ampersand actually represents
concatenation and star represents
anything followed by Ki
so this is going to be my lookup value
in total
I'll give a comma
next I'll select my table array starting
from the representatives column till the
end of total column because I want to
find the sales
I'll give another comma
my column index number based on the
table array we have selected is 5.
comma the range lookup is 0 because I
want to find an exact match
close the bracket hit enter you can see
it here
vlookup has returned me 999.5 which is
actually Cable's total
now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I can directly
write it in the vlookup function
so I'll write the vlookup function
something like this so my lookup value
I'll pass Ki within double inverted
commas because Ki is a character value
So within double inverted commas I'm
writing Ki followed by Ampersand which
is for concatenation
followed by
a star
within double inverted commas so this is
going to be my lookup values this in
total means anything that appears after
Ki will be considered as the lookup
value
again the table array I'll select as
these rows and columns
comma my column index number would be 5
comma the range lookup is zero if I
close the bracket hit enter you see we
have the same value so this is another
method or another way of using
vlookups
okay now moving ahead let's explore
another feature of vlookup so if the
vlookup function cannot find a match it
returns a hash an a error now if you
want you can use the if any function to
replace the hash any error with a
friendly message so suppose
you want to find the region in which an
order was placed on 10th of May 2018.
now if the order date is not found I
want to return a message that is invalid
date
so
if you look at the order date
column we don't have any value for 10th
of May 2015. you can see these values we
don't have any value corresponding to
this date
so
if my vlookup function cannot find this
lookup value I'll return invalid date so
let me show you
how to write this
I'll type my vlookup function
I'll give my order date as 10th of May
2015.
as my lookup value and then
I'll consider my table array starting
from the order date column till the end
of
region column
we'll give another comma my column index
number would be 2 this time based on the
table array we have selected comma I
want an exact match
so I'll give 0 close the bracket and hit
enter
there you go it has returned me an error
now I want to convert this error to a
friendly message saying invalid date so
let me show you how to do it I'll do it
here so to return a valid message
I'll use the if any function
and within if any function I'll give my
vlookup function
so let me type if any
I'll hit tab
now for the value parameter I'll use my
vlookup function so my lookup value is
going to be the order date
comma my table array I'll select from
the order date column till the end of
region column comma my column index
number is going to be 2
comma my range lookup is 0
I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double quotes
since it is
a text message
I close the bracket hit enter you can
see
the result which is invalid date
now moving on to the final section of
the demo
we have two-way lookup
now in the vlookup function the column
index parameter is normally hard coded
as a static number however you can also
create a dynamic column index by using
the match function to locate the right
column
and this technique allows you to create
a dynamic two-way lookup matching on
both rows and columns
now let me first show you how a match
function works so suppose
I want to find the index where unit cost
column is present
so here I'll use the match function
I'll give my lookup value as the unit
cost column name
comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my match type as 0 for exact
match
if I close the bracket hit enter it
returns me 4 because
my array was selected from the
representatives column till the unit
cost column and in this array unit cost
is at the fourth index
all right now using this idea let's
solve the following problem I want to
find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan
so let's
write our vlookup formula
write vlookup
my lookup value is J5 which has the
representative's name as Morgan comma
while table array I'll select from
C2
till
F12
I'll give a comma and this time I know
that my column index number is at
4 but I'll be using the match function
to find the same
so I'll write match
my lookup value is
unit cost comma
my lookup array is from C1 till F1
comma my match type is 0
I close this bracket give another comma
and I'll give my range lookup as 0
close the bracket hit enter you can see
for Morgan the unit cost is 19.99 you
can verify from the table for Morgan the
unit cost is 19.99
all right now
we have another question here
I want to find how much sales did
Andrews make in the central region so
here I have
two lookup values one is Central one is
Andrews now looking at these two values
I want to find the total
to solve such problems
let me first create
another table
I'll place the table somewhere here
okay so let me just paste the table here
all right now I'll create another column
where I'll merge the values of region
and representatives so here let me
create another column okay I'll just
name this column as
region
rep
all right now this column
I'll use the concatenation operator
so I'll Select East
use Ampersand and then select Jones I'll
hit enter
now the same thing I'll just duplicate
it
for the other rows as well so I have my
new column created Now using this table
I can easily solve the problem
now to find the total I'll write my
vlookup formula
so my lookup value
will be a combination of j11
ampersand
k11
comma well table array will start from
the region rep which has the values of
region and rep combined
till
the last column
and from this table array my column
index number is 5
and my range lookup is zero if I close
the bracket hit enter you can see
for central region which is this one
and for Andrew's representative the
total is 149.25
all right now we are done with our demo
let's have a quick glance at what all we
did in this demo
okay so first of all we saw our data set
which was a sales data set that we used
then we started with our first example
to see how vlooker performs an exact
match we also saw how using the formulas
Tab and lookup and reference you can
write vlookup in
another way so you can use the function
arguments to give your vlookup
parameters next we saw how vlooker
performs an approximate match so we had
mat and raw which were not present in
the representatives column
after that
we saw an important property of vlookup
that is vlookup only looks to the right
followed by
vlookup only Returns the first match
following which we saw
that vlookup is case insensitive so here
we had added a new row where Gill was
present in uppercase but still we look
up
found the total revenue for Gill which
was in sentence case or properties next
we saw how we can use wildcard
characters to
use vlookups
and here we saw how to use an if any
function along with vlookup and finally
we saw how to use two vlookups choose

simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are on
the sheet of Microsoft Excel and here
you can see some data on my sheet
that is employee name employee ID and
salary
so here we are going to perform our
horizontal lookup but before that let me
show you that this particular drop down
menu so this particular drop down menu
has all the names of the employees in
this particular table and we have
created this using data validation in
Excel if you want to create the drop
down menus just like this then feel free
to check out our data validation in
Excel tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement each lookup in Excel so here
we have employee name but we want to
find out the employee ID so for that
let's create the hlookup now for that
equals to hlookup
now the first one is a lookup value so
this one is the cell which is the
employee name now after that the table
array we have to select all the table
arrays here
now
the row index number so the employee ID
is in row index number 2 according to
the table so for that provide 2 and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select jet
then you'll find the employee ID of
check and if you select Jerry you'll
find the employee ID of cherry
reflecting here now similarly let's find
out the salary of all the employees
using hlookup so equals hlookup
and lookup value that happens to be the
name of the employee now the table array
and next we have row index number that
is salary happens to be the third row in
the table so three and
exact match
close the bracket and enter so now if
you change the values in this particular
drop down menu you will find the
employee ID and their particular salary
so Jack happens to be carrying the
employee ID as one zero zero one and his
salary is ten thousand so similarly
let's try to find out ptos employee ID
and salary
so there you go 1005 and 50 000 as
salary so that's how you use hlookup in
Excel here you can see the first chart
so this particular data is converted
into a table format to avoid confusion
while you're fixing the data so here you
can see the name of the employee
employee ID Department salary and date
of Channel and here you can see the
salary column and the bonus percentage
of each and every employee based on
their salaries now coming to the new
data table and here on the table 2 which
is an updated table here you can find we
are going to find out the department of
the employee and the current Department
of employee and the bonus percentage
based on his or her salary so why are we
finding current Department again
so here you can see that we have an
intern Emily who has joined in the air
2020 but recently she got promoted as a
developer so her department has been
changed from Department in turn to
Department developer in 2021 so that's
what we're gonna find out here in the
current Department using X lookup now
let's start to implement xlookup so for
that
equals to xlookup
and for lookup you can see if you need
to find out the lookup value lookup
array return array and all the other two
are not important right now but you can
use them to get some exact matches in
the future we'll also use that in the
future for now let's try to use the
first three parameters that is lookup
value lookup array and written array so
the lookup value is the name of the
employee Mary and lookup array is right
here which is this one
now we are going to select the lookup
array then comma and we're going to look
up the department so this is the
department lookup array
and that's all we need
close the bracket and press enter
okay I think we missed out the lookup
value
so the employee or the lookup value
which we required was missed so I've
added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go
press enter and you have the department
here now let's add it to all the rows
and here you have all the rows and all
the data related to all the employees
now we will find out the current
Department as you can see here you have
Emily as intern which is the older data
but what if you needed the latest data
that is the developer in the year 2021
right for that you might want to to work
the X lookup formula a little bit so
let's try that X lookup
lookup value which is the same and comma
now where you have to look for the array
that is lookup array this one and the
return array which happens to be this
one
and next
you can find the exact match for this
one so that's all right exact match and
here comes the important part where you
have to search last to first by default
X lookup searches for first to last that
is like this in the starting place to
the last place so that's the reason why
we had Emily as intern so now if we give
last to first then it retrieves the
latest data where Emily will be shown as
developer now select that and now you
can close the brackets and press enter
so let's add that to all the rows there
you go now you can see Emily Clark Peter
and James all they have got their
updated job profiles as you can see in
the original data Emily is a developer
now so is Clark who was originally a
tester and he got promoted to
development team in 2021 similarly Peter
became a senior Finance executive in
2021 and James the manager of sales now
let's try to find out the bonus for all
these employees based on their salary so
this one is quite simple
so X lookup
now the lookup value is their existing
salary
comma and the bonus part so the lookup
array is the salary range
then here is another important point so
here you might want to find the exact
match but finding an exact match will
not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter so
so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is thirty eight thousand
twenty two thousand thirty nine Etc but
here in the ranges we have provided 10
20 30 14 50. so what if the value is
between 30 and 20 that's when you want
the less number right that's when you
want the number which is equivalent to
30 or less than 30 which happens to be
15 percent so that's how it has worked
here that is 0.15 percent bonus to the
actual salary and with that we have come
to an end of this session on Excel

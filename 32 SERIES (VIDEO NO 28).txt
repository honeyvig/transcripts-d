hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss 32 important points
regarding sterilization point number one
sterilization is a process by which an
article surface or medium is framed of
all microorganisms this process destroys
all viable microbes including viruses on
endospores point number two this
infection is a process that destroys
vegetative pathogens but not endo sports
point number three temperature of
autoclave is 121 degree Celsius for 15
minutes for 15lbs pressure or 134
degrees Celsius for three minutes at
30lbs pressure point number four
temperature of hot air over nice 160
degree Celsius for 120 minutes or 170
degrees Celsius for 60 minutes number
five
flash temperature is 72 degree Celsius
for 15 to 20 seconds number six
vaccine bath temperature is 60 degree
Celsius for 60 minutes
number 7 LG media on low flow serum
slope or sterilized by heating it 80
degree Celsius for 30 minutes for three
consecutive days number eight most
reliable method of sterilization is heat
number nine dusting powder is sterilized
by hot air Obon number ten liquid

number 25 the riddle vocal coefficient
is the ratio of the delusion of
disinfectant that kills a microorganism
to the dilution of phenol that kills the
organism in the same time under
identical conditions number 26 Sigma
stain test this test also determines the
phenol coefficient of the test
disinfectant but unlike in riddle waka
method where they test is carried out in
the water here the disinfectants are
made to act in presence of East
suspension that is 3% dried human faeces
to sigh malade the presence of organic
matter number 27 filthy sites test it is
a triple Challen test designed to
determine the concentrations of
disinfectant that will be effective in
clean and dirty conditions the
disinfectant is challenged by three
successive editions of a bacterial
suspension during the course of the test
number 28 southern blotting technique
identifies DNA number 29 northern
blotting technique identifies are any
number 30 western blotting technique
identifies proteins number 31 double
helix is for DNA
number 32 triple helix is for collation
that's it for today's 32 series guys
hope you all device this points again
thank you

let's take a look at the new case
preserving find and replace in Visual
Studio
I want to rename the string person with
the string animal in this file
so I'm going to open the quick replace
dialog hitting Ctrl H
here I'll click the new a b button to
preserve the case
and then click replace all
this replaced all person with animal and
notice how the casing was preserved
this works in replace in files as well
just remember to check The Preserve case
checkbox and then hit replace all
the strings were replaced and casing
preserved

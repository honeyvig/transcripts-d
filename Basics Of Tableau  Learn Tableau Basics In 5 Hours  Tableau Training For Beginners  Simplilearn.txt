box below and with that in mind over to
our training experts hey everyone
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
in this session we will be learning the
W expert full course let's have a look
at the agenda for today's session first
we will learn what exactly is W followed
by that we will understand the data
connections provided by Tableau then we
will learn how to create data extracts
using Tableau moving ahead we will
understand the Tableau calculations
aggregations and Tableau creating quick
table calculations box and viscous plots
Etc next we will learn each and every
single type of charts available in
Tableau then we will move ahead into
formatting and annotations in Tableau
then we will understand how to filter
data in Tableau I hope I made myself
clear over the agenda but before we
begin make sure that you have subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn this is Ben Ben
started a store that sells automobile
parts like brakes exhausts tires
lubricants and car Interiors he made a
good start with his business and
achieved profits however as days passed
by along with his growing business he
faced some business challenges he
received orders from a variety of
customers with different needs and
requirements for example the northern
states had higher demand for performance
parts than others in the eastern states
demanded farm truck parts and lubricants
more in apart from this a few products
weren't performing well in the market
and remained on sold with the unbalanced
requirements and economy variations Ben
had a tough time helping his customers
with products on demand
he slowly realized he needed something
new that can help him tackle the store's
problems
what if Ben had a tool that could keep
track of his store's inventory and sales
a geographical map that can recognize
the demand for various types of products
from different regions
a forecast feature that could predict
the economic fluctuations in the market
and help them visualize every single
detail visually on one single dashboard
this software could practically solve
many business problems and also could
identify new opportunities to improvise
and grow the business such types of
software tools are called business
intelligence tools and one such tool is
Tableau Tableau is capable of learning
the store's business patterns and
running queries against the data to help
visualize the flaws and resolve them
quickly now let us understand how Ben
used Tableau and solve the issues
related to his business Ben collected
his store's entire sales data from the
previous quarter and ingested it into
tableau Now using Tableau Ben was able
to categorize the data based on monthly
sales it took the daily sales and
considered it as the x-axis and then
Tableau computed the sales in the store
now then clearly understood the products
that outperform the sales charts and the
products that did not have much demand
let us elaborate a little Ben found that
the performance parts like sports
exhaust turbochargers and engine
management systems were selling well
with the Tableau forecast feature Ben
identified the demand for Performance
Products in the next quarter so he
raised the prices on a few products that
had the peak demand and earned higher
profits in the second forecast report
Ben found no significant elevation nor a
drop in the demand for the tractor parts
and lubricants apart from this Ben saw
the sales graphs of electronics
encountered a drop in the current
quarter compared to the previous quarter
in the sales of electronics like the
music and infotainment systems were low
to improvise and stabilize the
fluctuating sales of electronics Ben
came up with some exciting clearance
sale offers on electronic products using
tablet's geographic map feature then
understood the product demand at a
regional level he found the northern
regions were interested in performance
kits for their imported sports cars the
Eastern regions had good man for truck
parts and lubricants using Tableau then
could generate various visualizations
based on his data and come up with
business oriented decisions
last but not least Ben could also
monitor his decisions and was able to
make some necessary modifications to his
business model on the go Ben is now
delighted as working with Tableau is a
smooth and efficient process today
Tableau is being recognized as one of
the best in class business intelligence
tools because of its powerful and
dependable features Tableau can support
and connect to a wide variety of data
sources like the cloud dbms Excel sheets
and even get connected to real-time data
from websites and Bin keeps his
customers happy using Tableau to solve
his business problems today more and
more leading business organizations are
leaning towards business intelligence
tools intending to improve their
business
upon quite a success in this business
Ben decided to get a detailed
understanding of Tableau by enrolling in
simply learns Tableau training program
which is led by industry experts who can
train him according to the current
business and I.T standards to make his
business even more successful so what is
w
so before we understand what exactly is
W let us imagine a simple situation
imagine that you are an office worker
and you get some loads of data uh maybe
like millions of rows or billions of
rows and you're supposed to extract the
insights of that particular data so what
do you do you basically load that data
into a database and try to write the SQL
commands and then try to extract the
insights of that particular data
so this kind of approach is basically
time consuming and you get exhausted now
what if you had a tool which could write
all the SQL commands for you in the
background and all you had to do is just
to drag and drop the data
sounds interesting right
so Tableau is just the same all you have
to do is just drag and drop the data and
it will automatically write all the SQL
commands you ever wanted to write on
that particular data and it will give
you live data interactions and advices
for the future
now with this let us understand the
definition of w so basically Tableau is
a business and analytical software tool
developed in America W helps people to
understand visualize and make data
driven decisions in real time with
extreme agility and accuracy
now with this let us continue with the
next topic which will be about the
various versions of w so at first we
have the Tableau desktop so Tableau
desktop is a data visualization
application to facilitate you to xmi in
virtually any kind of structured data
and generate highly interactive
beautiful graphs dashboards and reports
within minutes once a quick installation
you can tie to virtually any data source
from spreadsheets to data warehouses and
display information in several graphic
perspectives designed to be easy to
utilize you'll be working more rapidly
than ever before next we have the W
server it is a business intelligence
application that offers browser-based
analytics anyone can utilize it is a
rapid fire alternative to the slow pace
of traditional business intelligence
software it is an online solution meant
for sharing Distributing and
collaborating on content created in
Tableau what makes W different it is
proposed to everyone there is no
scripting required so everyone can grow
to be an analytics expert you can grow
your deployment as you require it
train online for free find answers and
minutes and not in months that's the
specialty of w
now followed by the W server we have W
online
so Tableau online is a business
intelligence application that offers
browser-based analytics anyone can
utilize as discussed before it is a
rapid fire alternative to slow based
additional business intelligence
software so Tableau online is a secure
cloud-based solution for sharing and
collaborating on Tableau view views and
dashboards next up we have the Tableau
public
so now I want to give you guys a serious
heads up if you are a beginner in tab W
public is like an open source whatever
the data you choose to work on using
table Republic it goes to public so kind
of like Tableau public is not preferable
if you want to work on your company
sensitive and confidential data W public
is a free software to facilitate anyone
to get connected to a spreadsheet or a
file and create interactive data
visualizations for the web
it is delivered as a service that
permits the user to be up to and running
overnight with table Republic users can
construct amazing interactive visuals
and publish them quickly without the
help of programmers or ID
it is designed for organizations to
facilitate their websites with
interactive data visualizations there
are higher limits on the size of data
you can work with and among other
features you can keep your underlying
data hidden and lastly we have W reader
W reader is a free desktop application
that you can use to open and interact
with data visualizations built in
Tableau desktop with tab new reader you
can filter drill down and discover
humongous loads of data now moving ahead
we have the features of w
so these are the few important features
that you might want to consider
those are the first one robust security
table you take special care of data and
user security it has a foolproof
Security based authentication and
permission systems for data connections
and user success
W also gives you the freedom to
integrate with other security protocols
such as active directory Kerberos Etc an
important point to note here is that the
W practices low level filtering which
helps in keeping the data secure
followed by that we have the
collaboration and sharing feature tabli
provides convenient options to
collaborate with other users and
instantly share data in the form of
visualizations sheets dashboards Etc in
real time it allows you to securely
share data from various data sources
such as on-premise on-cloud hybrid Etc
instant and easy collaboration and data
sharing helps in getting quick reviews
or feedback on data leading to a better
overall analysis of it another extremely
useful feature of Tableau is the use of
Time series and forecasting easy
creation of trend lines and forecasting
is possible due to tableau's powerful
back-end and dynamic front-end you can
easily get data predictions such as a
forecast or a trend line by simply
selecting some options and drag and drop
operations using your concerned fields
next up we have live and in-memory data
W ensures connectivity with both live
data sources and data extraction from
external sources as in memory data this
gives the user the flexibility to use
the data from more than one type of data
source without any restrictions you can
use data directly from data source by
establishing Library connections or keep
that data in memory by extracting data
from a data source as per their
requirement
tablely provides additional features to
support data connectivity such as an
automatic extract refreshes notifying
the user upon live connection fail Etc
next we have informative View and even
the mobile view one of the key features
of Tableau and the one that got its
popularity is its wide range of
visualizations in W you can make
visualizations such as bar chart pie
chart Gantt chart bullet chart motion
chart tree map box plot and many more
like you name it w got it you can select
and create any kind of visualizations
easily by selecting the visualization
type from the show me tab apart from
that it is capable to represent data in
mobile view as well W acknowledges the
importance of mobile phones and today's
world and provides the mobile versions
of Tableau app the next and the last
feature is that being capable of
accessing data from various kinds of
data sources W offers a wide range of
data source options where you can get
connected and fetch data from data
sources ranging from on-premise files
spreadsheets relational databases
non-relational databases online cloud
data data warehouses and many more
so followed by the features now we'll
discuss about the advantages of w
so following are the advantages of using
Tableau first one it has remarkable
visualization capabilities of course the
unparalleled capabilities of visualizing
information is on top of the list of tab
values software benefits followed by
that we have the ease of use the tools
intuitive manner of creating graphics
and a user-friendly interface allows
non-developers to utilize the basic apps
functionalities to the fullest users
arrange raw data into catchy diagrams in
a drag and drop way which facilitates
information analyzing and eliminates the
need for the help of IT department and
patent building
next high performance apart from its
high visualization functionality users
rates its overall performance as robust
and reliable the tool also operates fast
on big data which makes it powerful
performance on an important point on the
list of the advantages of Tableau and
next is the mobile friendliness one of
our best advantages out of the W
benefits is its efficient mobile
application which is available for both
IOS and Android it adds Mobility to
table users and allows them to keep
statistics at their fingertips as well
as supports their functionality that
desktop and online versions have
and finally we have a thriving community
and Forum W has a rich Community the
number of w fans who invest their
expertise and skills in the community is
increasing rapidly business users can
beef up their knowledge on data
processing and Reporting and get many
useful insights in this community also
Forum visitors are ready to help settle
any user issues and also share their
experience
next up we have the disadvantages of w
the first major disadvantage is the high
cost the Tableau is not the most
expensive visualization software
especially compared to such business
intelligence such as oracles and IBM
Solutions all the same the license is
quite costly for small and medium
companies which makes it one of the
considerable tablish disadvantages
next is the inflexible pricing W sales
team is not flexible enough to provide
case-by-case approach for their
customers ignoring the fact that each
company has its own a unique
requirements for visualization tool
package the W sales model requires
clients to purchase and extends license
from the start
as a result a lot of companies that you
establu arrive at the conclusion that
they don't need all their license
features they would prefer to buying a
set of requirements and scale them if
necessary
followed by that the next disadvantage
is for after sales support on multiple
message boards users complain that W
software lacks proper after sales
maintenance if customer has software
performance problem the support team
does not settle the matter by
investigating the problems root and
eliminating it next we have the power bi
capability or the poor business
intelligence capability as previously
mentioned the tool provides
best-in-class information visual
interpretation however it lacks the
functionality required for a fully
flashed business intelligence tool such
as large scale reporting the building of
data tables and statistic layouts and
lastly the poor versioning only the
recent Tableau version support revision
history while for the older ones
software rolling back is impossible now
with the advantages and disadvantages
discussed let's move into the top
companies hiring the companies which are
desperately looking for Tableau experts
are Accenture ey PepsiCo Deloitte Wells
Fargo capgemini and many more
now let's discuss the humongous and
handsome salaries offered by this Tech
Giants
so according to Glassdoor the average
salary of a tableau expert in America is
82 000 grants and for a beginner it is
somewhere around sixty thousand dollars
per annum and at the highest rate it is
1 lakh ten thousand dollars per annum
similarly the average salary of a
tableau expert in India is 5 lakh six
thousand per annum and for a beginner it
is somewhere around Three lakh Sixty
thousand and
and for a highly skilled experienced
Tableau expert the salaries range from 8
lakhs 75 000 per annum so let me now
begin with connecting to data now in
this particular topic
we are at the end of this lesson you
will be able to
understand how you can connect to
Tableau Data server you will be able to
differentiate between a join and blend
how can you perform a join on a data how
can you blend a data we will discuss the
various connection options available we
will understand how tablet server Works
in terms of the curb rocks
authentication all right uh we will
understand various performance
optimization techniques as well Shadow
extra extract as well as different
methods that we can prepare in terms of
the data that we want to analyze all
right so let me begin now the very first
topic which is uh connecting to chapter
server so I'm going to first take you
through a couple of presentation slides
here and then quickly move on to the
environment where we will actually then
start exploring the topic so
now when you want to connect to a data
source in Tableau server it's pretty
simple you can connect to a flat file in
your local machine so one is you will
click on to the server in the start
screen and uh you can specify the server
name you can specify and uh show your uh
login your credentials the username and
password and based on that you can
perform the you can have your connection
to the database all right so that's how
you can connect to the tablet server as
well all right so
that's the very first basic so the
Tableau administrator is the one who
assigns the roles and creates these data
sources all right and you have uh
Tableau has the facility in order to
import different forms of data for the
analysis for your ease and once you're
connected to the Tableau server then you
need to select the taboo server data
source on the data menu you will need to
select a data source to download a local
file a local copy you can select and
create a local copy and then you can
also duplicate a duplicate of that data
source will be added up into your data
window so that's how you can connect to
Tableau server as well all right and it
basically promotes various features
wherein uh you can then connect to the
taboo server for your data so you are in
this example you can see that you're
able to connect to the taboo server as
an admin and connect to the sample
Superstore and it downloads it creates a
local copy and duplicates all the data
in that particular data window
that's how we can see the sample
throughput shown and you can connect to
the server uh next we are going to also
understand what is joining and blending
so before I move on to the presentation
slides here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move on to the environment
directly let us start exploring these
blending and joining features or write
therein all right I'm going to simply
just clear all these sheets that we have
and
um let's go back to the connective data
source window all right now in terms of
uh this is where you're able to connect
you can see the Tableau server so it's
through the server that you can connect
with and you can specify your server
credentials and you can click on connect
and uh based on that that's how then you
can provide the credentials and login
all right now I do not have a server or
a connection wherein I can show that
example but this is how you can click on
any of these servers you would have to
type in the URL click on connect and
then provide the usernames and login
provided and that's how you can connect
to your data source using a server
option all right I'm going to show you
the file option wherein you can connect
to an Excel and let us discuss the join
and the blending parture all right so
let me click on
it says we have the sample support uh
data store here and in this
when I pulled in order all right I
pulled in the first shape so there are
three sheets in that particular Excel
file when we pull an order this is how
now you can identify that whatever are
uh these are the header names these are
the dimensions and measures that's how
it's getting identified if you can
notice all the dimensions are first
place you have all your measures then
you're able to identify the data type
and the role on ABC which is a
contextual value or numeric value that
means it's a dimension with a pound sign
what kind of a data role is it estabros
automatically identifying each of these
rules as well all right even in the
metadata that's how you can see the
field names the field uh name that you
want to see onto your table onto your
view and the table from which it's going
to be getting pulled in from in this you
can rename in case you want to change
the particular name hide it or Alias it
will describe it
all right so this is how you connect now
connections is where you have the option
to connect between knife and extract now
if you connect to live that's
interconnected to this particular sheet
live that means any updates happening
onto your uh sheets any kind of updates
on the sheet there is a light connection
it will automatically update your views
as well onto your sheets that you're
creating and in case if you select on an
extract all right this is what it means
that it allows uh what it does is it it
Imports that data into the Tableau Data
engine first in the data engine where
it's going to perform these queries it
will create an extract and based on
these we can then start using the
connections all right so what it does is
it disconnects it's more like a small
extract more like a cube if you
understand it in that manner taboo
creates an extract of that file
providing you a disconnected whether it
allows you to give you a better
performance a better query
uh that's how you can then work on and
start creating uh and working on these
extracts so you can refresh these uh
extracts at a timely manual as well so
that is what the Tableau extracts are
but it extracts it as a copy of the data
uh and saves it in the engine and that's
how then the performance as well gets
better in terms of using where you can
connect to your particular data all
right so you can work with uh multiple
data sources data sources can be of any
type all right wherein you can edit from
the number of lists that you can see it
can be a flat file a server file as we
saw or the saved one and we can also
then join multiple tables within the
data or we can also blend when it's
coming in from different data sources
then we can also perform a blending so
let me first show you an option for
joints now you can see we have the order
table law when I drag and drop the
people uh sheet as well here you can see
that Tableau has automatically created
or join all right it has automatically
created a join when we have pulled in
two tables coming in from the sheet and
by default all right we have the inner
joint that Tableau creates so it creates
a inner join here wherein again you can
then click on the join option here and
you can specify and modify the join
based on whether you want it as a inner
join which is a default you want a left
joint now if you see the right join has
been disabled here okay I will show
these options here by default the right
join is uh disabled by a tableau by
default by default and to enable that
you will have to uh connect to your
Excel sheet in a different manner I will
show that your shortly so that's how you
can change and you can perform your
joints this is where you can explore and
show The Joint cloth and here again then
you can specify like you can see a join
that's been created amongst the data
source which is region and region people
among these two data all right so it's
also showing you the join and whether it
is uh equal to or not equal to all right
so you can connect to multiple tables
and uh based on that you can add in
tables you can decide the different
joints and based on that then when you
click on sheet uh you will then be able
to see that there is a joint being
performed there are two tables now the
people stable also that has been added
in and it has now performed and you know
joined on our data and you can start
using this particular option so let's
say I'm going to pull in the region on
my columns and I'm going to have my face
onto my rows it's now providing me uh
details of my sales at a regional basis
now let's say I also want to analyze the
people belonging to these regions
depending on the color so it's going to
change the colors based on the central
East South and West all right that's how
these are uh the people the number of
people belonging to each region that it
has identified so that's how it has
taken up the region people as you saw
there was a join that was created and
it's giving us that particular option
and based on that you can see your we
just have this particular data source
here and that's how you can see now I
used it earlier as well if you remember
we had pulled in one particular table
hence the blue tick mark sign here
enables and shows us that this is the
primary data that they use now this
comes in picture when we're using a
particular join so let me right now just
um uh use this particular detail here
and we're not going to require this all
right so let's just close this we just
need one right now because we're
discussing on blending I'm going to show
you the blending part later right now
we're discussing on joints so uh that's
how you can join in your data sources
and you can combine multiple Fields
using these joints so when you have when
you have multiple tables you can see
simply connect to the data let me go
back to the data source page this is a
startup page the data source page and
you can see the joints has been
performed now let's say you want to
create a join where you want to force
due to certain situations and scenario
where you want to post or write out a
join all right or right join or for that
matter you want to write a custom
sequence now you're not able to write a
SQL right here in the in the drag area
pane where you can drag and drop your
sheets from the Excel file or any kind
of a file that you're connected to for
that and to enable the right join you
will need to uh connect to your data in
a specific manner so let me open up a
new instance of Tableau here
and let me show that to you as to how we
can enable the right choice and how we
can have our custom sqls as well so in
case if you want to write in a custom
SQL on our view then how can we perform
that initial custom SQL all right
okay so let us connect to our data here
and I'm going to take you on to the
Excel file now when I click on the
samples Focus store here okay uh what we
have done is we clicked on open and
that's how we opened up the uh file all
right and that's how we could see the
sheets now instead of using the open
option directly what I'm going to do is
in the drop down right here instead of
open we have an option that says open
with a legacy connection all right this
is what is going to enable us to write a
custom SQL where we can specify a query
rather than using the entire data source
or pulling in the entire table so quick
clicking on the second option in the
drop down in the open uh tab here you
will be able to see the open with Legacy
connection I'm going to uh so ensure
that you've selected that and that's how
you will then connect to the data source
and with that you now have a new custom
SQL option that's opened up for yours
this is where you can once you've
connected you can double click on the
new custom SQL and you can write in your
query you can write in the SQL where you
want to perform the query and pull in
your data all right you can have your
select from
foreign
orders
all right so that's how you can perform
and you can write in a custom SQL and
you can pull in the required data you
can or have your required table that you
can pull in in terms of creating a SQL
that you want to pull in or and have
your data on right so you can have your
select from the
overdose and
preview the results
so here you can see the order table has
9940 we have a preview of the data
available in that particular uh sheet
that we pulled in all right and we can
now parameters is what I'm going to
cover when we come on to that particular
topic so I'm going to leave this for now
so that's how you can write your custom
SQL and you can click on OK and that's
going to pull in your entire data and as
you can see now instead in the earlier
views I'm going to just switch to the
earlier instance of Tableau you could
see that you could see the name of the
table that I dragged and pulled in you
could see the name order but in case
when we write a custom SQL then it gives
us the name which is written as custom
SQL queries all right and this is where
you can get the information you can edit
the query in case you want to change the
results and requirements so that's how
instead of clicking on open you click on
open Legacy connection and you can have
your own custom SQL defined now along
with this all right when you open and
when you click on a legacy connection
when I drag in the people's table here
you can see that even the option for
right joints have now been enabled so by
default Tableau disables the option for
right join and in case in certain
situations and circumstances you want
the right join to be enabled you win in
the same manner you have to import and
connect to your data you
Legacy
secret and you will have these right
join which is going to be enabled there
for you all so you can have your custom
sqls or the right joints in that case
which gets enabled and you can use the
custom SQL or a right join right so that
was custom SQL then uh joining is where
you can as I mentioned identify and
choose between the Clauses and the
Clause that you want to add in right now
let me show you an example of blending
as well so I'm again going to open a new
instance of tableau
all right and uh with that I'm going to
show you the example of blending so
let's say you have uh you want to join
in and when is the best time when is the
best way that you should use now joining
it when you have all your multiple
tables that you want to join coming in
from one data source blending would be
required when you want to join in uh
multiple tables coming in from different
data sources or for that matter you can
also blend even though the tables are
coming in from a single data source
there might be instances that you might
want to have still perform a blend
instead of a joint so let me show that
option to you all right so let me
connect to the data
let's connect to excel pull in our
sample supersoul file that we have we
have the order tables all right and I'm
going to go on to these sheets here all
right so we have one order we have one
data which is the order table now I am
going to again click on add a new data
source coming in from the same Excel
file and this time I'm going to have the
people's table
and move to the sheet so now if you
notice we can see two uh data sets here
which is one for the orders and one for
people here and uh in here now this is
where the blending will will take place
this is where you will have a blend
automatically when you pull in a view if
there is a common view that comes into
picture now let's say I'm going to first
pull in the order date onto the columns
all right
and as soon as I pull in you can see
that my order table has now got a blue
check mark which has become a primary
data source all right and now let me
pull in sales onto my rules
and from people let me have
uh from the people's table let's have
region pulled in and added to the color
so region has become a secondary data
set and now you can see a blend sign
right a linking a data blending that has
automatically been performed on both
these two data sets all right that we
have the order table and the people's
table blue being primary and people uh
which is being secondary in this case
all right so that's how you can mention
now in terms of blending what happens is
you cannot specify the joints here in
this case there is a primary and
secondary data and it is automatically
blending in the data for you it is
automatically pulling in uh the data you
will not be able to your select on the
kind of join you will not be able to
manipulate the joints so that's how even
though at times you have the same tables
that are coming in as I mentioned there
are times where you might want to
perform and change the join so that's
when you can use the joining table
option that comes into picture so that's
the difference
you're blending and between joining the
tables
right so uh you can see this available
link and you can see how it was simple
to drag a particular View and uh pull in
data and your as well region has been
added to the color pin because of which
the Legends have been created identify
all four regions present in the data and
it's also letting us know here in the
marks that region is coming in from the
secondary table you can see the orange
ambotic marker and that's how you can
identify that region is coming in from
the secondary table that's been created
all right in terms of uh connecting as
well wherein you can combine and half
the joint enabled now depending on the
kind of data all right going back to the
data source depending on the kind of
tables and the kind of data that we have
that's when we can enable and have the
joints that we can decide on all right
so one is you would require and need to
have
multiple uh Legacy connection with which
you can then Define the right outer
joints all right and that's how you can
proceed and have additional uh joints
that you can work on
uh we also discussed how we could create
and connect to a custom SQL query all
right and uh that is how we could using
the Legacy connection uh also enable the
right outer join wherein we could then
perform a right join on our tables as
well all right and in case if it's a
query then it gives them the name of uh
the query uh as a custom query which is
what we saw onto the preview and the
extract there all right now in terms of
extract all right now extracts are
basically your saved subsets of the data
source which will help you in improving
the performance so instead of as I
mentioned instead of being connected to
a live connection it is better that we
select an extract which creates a subset
and sources in the uh Tableau engine
wherein it performs the queries and it
takes advantage of this functionality
where it is not connected to the
original data source and with this it
can actually reduce the total amount of
data in terms of defining and limiting
it so that's how you can create an
extract and let's say uh once you've
created an extract you can then perform
like I said you have the edit option
where you can edit the additional
detailing you can allow an incremental
fetch happening where then you can
refresh the data each time or your data
is updated you can provide an
information fair so this can help you in
improving your performance you can take
advantage of the functionality see in
terms of the data source for using the
discounts or the distinct counts as well
and moreover it's more like an offline
mode you're actually accessing your data
as an offline access where it's not
directly connected and you're able to
use it like a data local data all right
so that is the difference between a live
and an extract so that's how you can
make use of the Legacy connections as
well so let's go back to the
presentation slides and have a recap now
[Music]
um
these are the joining tables that's what
we discussed at in terms of the tables
that we have we can join our table and
we have various joints available where
it makes it easy for us to uh analyze
the data that we want to review we can
join to multiple tables and based on
that we can customize the inner the list
the right or the full outer join now the
full outer join also depends on the kind
of data source that you're connected to
all right so in case of an Excel file we
still do not have the right outer join
option which is enabled so this possible
option again when you open with a legacy
depending on the data type is how you
will have the right Auto join that you
can pause and have it enabled so this
would be depending on the kind of data
source file also that you have and you
have these four joint types that you can
use in terms of joining tables in
Tableau now when would you want to use a
join all right so uh a scenario is that
you have a sales manager of an online
shopping website and he wants to analyze
the customers who have returned at least
half the number of orders that they have
placed now to fulfill this requirement
he will require a worksheet wherein he
can join the orders and the return
tables on a particular common Dimension
all right so that's how then he can
create a join we can change this between
uh the inner default to a left join
between the order tables and the return
tables and based on that we can then get
to know the customers who have returned
at least half the number of orders that
were placed all right
now in terms of enabling a right outer
join uh this is taken care of by the
Microsoft jet data engine driver so in
case if you all are facing of trouble
where you're not able to connect and see
that particular option it's throwing an
error this Legacy connection options
comes in only when you're using a
Microsoft jet data engine driver this is
easily available in case if you do not
have it you can install this driver and
with this it will enable the right outer
joy and the custom SQL for us all right
to enable the uh right out of join here
that's how you open it with a particular
or Legacy connection now in terms of a
write out a join we saw an example we
can force and use the right outer joint
we can select on a new custom SQL where
we can type in and have a custom uh SQL
generated
and that's how we can work on with the
SQL where we can provide the SQL syntax
and based on that the data source will
then be generated
now in terms of blending this is what
happens when you have multiple data
sources in your viewer when you want to
establish a link between them or you
want to blend your data uh it does not
create a row level joint so in case uh
like the example that we did also which
is coming in from the same sheets from
the same Excel file but we did not want
to create a row level join then that's
when data blending would come in handy
you can use it with a related data
across multiple sources that you want to
analyze in one particular view so that's
how you can blend your data which
creates a primary and a secondary data
so we saw that in this example uh you
can see that it is a customer segment
department and some of sales wherein the
bars are being created which are coming
in from the from the primary connection
but in terms of the sales plan all right
these sales plan are coming in from a
secondary data you can see the Amber
connection your the Android that is
allowing you to understand and segregate
and differentiate that it is a secondary
connection
so in Tableau that's how you can
identify as you saw that your primary
source and you have your secondary
source wherein you can identify and
distinguish you can distinguish between
the common fields that are present in
your data and uh you can establish a
connection in case if it has not
established a link you saw that there
was an automatic link then you can
provide a link Autumn uh by explicitly
defining a link as well let me take you
back to uh the environment
all right so this was the custom SQL
foreign
provided then you can provide a
particular link onto your view you can
have the option if it has not enabled
then you can select your particular you
can see that uh it has not uh implicitly
defined but it's giving you an option
that there is possibility of linking so
you can explicitly Define you can click
on this link and use person as a linking
field and this is also linked in your
data with the previous data that you
have all right so that's how you can
Define and explicitly mention uh the way
that you can blend your data and you can
identify another way can also be wherein
you can edit uh the connection in the
mapping and that's where you can perform
so you can go back to your data sources
and you can explicitly Define you can
identify uh whether the first rows are
the names whether the rows your are
automatically generating a field or not
all right so that's how you can have
these two tables and you can Define the
blending whether you want it or not you
can disable the linking as well in case
you don't want to perform a particular
link
so uh with uh coming to that now let us
understand I've already discussed the
difference between the joints and blends
and where you can use it so let's uh
have a recap again or in terms of
joining uh joining is a SQL term wherein
is combining two data sources coming in
from a single data source while in terms
of blending it's more about combining
two different data sources into one
single sheet all right uh joining is
done once at the data source and this
can be used for every worksheet while
blending will be done individually for
every worksheet okay and
features that are joined must must exist
in the SQL database while in blending it
helps us combine the database which is
coming in from different sources
different locations and in case if it's
a multi-dimensional source if it's a
queue then you cannot perform a joint
and in terms of blending you have a
primary source and uh but in in terms of
a primary source it cannot be accused
but your second resource can definitely
be a cube that you can use in terms of
performing a blend all right
uh so that's how you can optimize your
connections you can select whether you
want to have uh perform a blend on your
connections you want to perform a join
depending on the kind of connections
that you have and that's how you can
work with them with the different data
socials that you have available you're
going to proceed further in
understanding how we can create data
extracts all right so as I mentioned the
extracts are where you create a subset
of your data source you can extract a
particular data you can save it as a
subset which will help you in performing
and improving your query so instead of
the live you can simply click on the
extract which will create a tableau
extract for you all right
so uh let me just show you let me take
you to the uh repository and in that you
will be able to identify in my Tableau
repository data sources you can see that
uh we have a tableau extractor for World
indicator so what it's done is it has
created a subset of the word indicator
data source and it's created it's
disconnected it's an offline mode which
can allow us to improve the performance
it can be accessed offline as well when
you're away when you're probably
traveling and we can then create an
extract where we can keep refreshing it
with the original data and we can then
replace it with the content or we can
provide a complete incremental refresh
with these all right now extract can
also be created from uh within our data
sets as well once you've performed so
let's say let me go back to
let's have
category in our columns let's have
quantity on our roads now even here you
have the option of going under the data
menu where you can uh click on the
extract data so whatever you've selected
any kind of performances and any kind of
the applications that you perform now
this is your uh data that you perform
now in instead of even though it's a
live connection you can still go to the
data menu here and you can click on
Create and extract a data which will
create a subset all right which will
create a subset for you where you can
create this data and you can provide the
different fields wherein you can select
what you want to filter whether you want
to add a specific filter to your field
whether you want to specify the
aggregation data for the visible
Dimensions this is where you can select
the option for the measures to be
aggregated uh the default instead of
using the default uh what is the kind of
aggregation that you want to use so this
can allow you to minimize the size of
your file as well and increase your
performance you can click on aggregation
and you want to roll up the dates to
your to quarter to month you can select
on the aggregation
the number of rows that you want to
allow in terms of the incremental fetch
or you want to provide
the incremental sets for all rows or
just the top particular selected rows so
you can select on that particular option
once you've specified all these
detailings you can then click on extract
and that's going to uh save the
subsequent uh file in the location that
you have saved in terms of the extract
and it will save up and extract for you
all right so when you click on extract
it will ask you for a substitute
location of where you want to save it
there is a customs query that we had
used and let's say if you save it on the
desktop itself you can see the save time
which is a DOT pde which is a Tableau
Data extract and the next time you can
start working using these data extracts
and you can start performing where you
do not need to then have your custom SQL
written in or any other detailing you
can simply use the extract and start
working on it all right you can actually
uh restrict the size and improve the
performance and you can perform data
extract from these as well all right
foreign
menu option here you have the option to
replace your particular data source so
let's say you have your uh option where
you want to uh perform of or incremental
sets then you can replace the data you
can upgrade it or for that matter you
can go to this particular uh table you
can refresh your data with the uh
connection where you have the additional
refresh data you can view your data you
can duplicate it rename it we uh just
discuss how we can create the extract
data options as well so that's how you
can perform and see and and have an
extract
of your data so that was uh using your
data extracts
now uh you can also write custom SQL so
we've discussed that let me take you
back to the presentation slide and have
a recap so here this is the window that
we saw in terms of the extract where you
can add in the qualifications where you
can narrow down your data even more
further you can select an incremental
search whether you want it for all the
rows or limit the number of rows to be
included in that particular extract uh
then we also saw that how we could write
a custom SQL we could open it in a
Legacy Collection that uh helped us to
open up a custom SQL window where we can
write down the SQL with the exact data
that we want to analyze this can again
help us in improving the query
performances where we can write down and
provide uh an optimized query against
our data that we want to use
okay uh in terms of the supported data
sources a lot of you all had questions
what kind of data sources are supported
now Tableau desktop is uh supporting the
uh it determines uh the support
depending on the kind of license that
you have purchased all right so only
when you have the required license it
will support the different data source
types and you have a personal Edition
which provides you and allows you to uh
use the support for a lot of databases
uh but it is the professional Edition
that provides you additional database
options that you can connect to so data
such as text files access files Excel
sheets uh and so on these can be
connected through the personal editions
while in terms of a professional Edition
the professional license this is where
you can connect other than the other
than the personal editions you can
connect to the personal uh additional
databases like your Oracle SQL and you
can connect to certain more additional
connections here which is supported 40
plus data connections which is supported
in the professional Edition all right so
that's how you can connect to these
different connections now
also along with that once you have your
server that comes into picture uh What A
Servo does is it provides you a code
Ross authentication which is a supported
trusted authentication or that it uses
in terms of your single sign-on all
right so what it does is in this case is
that uh as you can see it is a protocol
that is provided to trust the
authentication between your machine
and that's how uh it uses a third-party
network service called as the KDC the
key distribution center which provides a
secure connection between your desktop
and the servo machine and this is
supported based on the Kerberos
authentication all right and that's
where you can it handles in it uses only
one user authentication the permissions
and the access control uh in such cases
like the workbooks uh is is going to be
now these the workbooks and extracts
will not be handled by Squadron but uh
the permissions and access control those
are the things those are the detailing
that for Ross would be handling in terms
of your data connection
all right so basically if your taboo
server has a code block enabled uh on
your machine with a valid active
directory credentials then what Tableau
does is it connects to your server and
it completely skips the steps of
authenticating so in case let me take
you to the environment
you're in the environment you can see
the server option and in this you have
the published workbook now let's say
when you want to you've created your
workbook and you want to publish it onto
your server now this is where it asks
you to connect to the server here it
asks you to provide the credentials and
then based on that it then asks you once
you've connected to let's say you
connected to your server it is then
going to ask you a sign on for that
particular configuration now if you have
a for growth environment which is
activated then it's going to skip these
basic steps here and it will directly
allow you to connect and Skip these
connection uh that comes in in between
so that is what is called Ross
Authentication
right so it's a single sign-on method
and once you have that enabled then you
can make use of these you can you need
to configure your Tableau server with
these configurations all right so it's a
three-way Authentication Protocol
now how this works is a mechanism of
mutual authentication between the client
and the server is provided with the
corbos authentication so when the Hugo
user logs into the directory it directly
asks for the credentials which are
authenticated by full block and once
this is authenticated a ticket is
generated and sent to the user's
computer and then when the user tries to
connect to the Tableau server from the
desktop or the web browser the server or
the Tableau server authenticates the
user and it directly allows us to
perform now this mechanism is provided
before the network connection is opened
up between the client and the server
right
so how does it work in terms of a single
sign-on how does it support it is it
supports a single sign-on option wherein
you have the server configuration and in
this you have a core blocks tab that you
can uh Define enabling the single
sign-on options in terms of the
environment where you can connect uh
individually you can connect with a
single sign-on to connect to the server
from your desktop or the web browser all
right in terms of trying to optimizing
your query
now how can you optimize your query W
adopts various query optimization
techniques to improve the query
performance all right so what it does is
it it provides parallel query where it
improves the performance speed of the
dashboard by performing and providing a
capability of executing a parallel query
so in this case what happens is it
executes more queries at the same time
it is independent uh queries that start
at the same time and hence they are
faster and improve the performance so
this is what Tableau does it provides a
parallel query next is it has the query
Fusion in this what it does is Tableau
has the ability to reduce any kind of
complex or large number of queries into
a pure simple one so that's how it again
optimizes your performance all right and
then it also has external query caching
in this it quickens up the process of
optimizing your data by processing it
into a cache all right so that uh it
does not need to go and hit in the
warehouse every time that you require a
particular data so this is possible with
the external query crashing so Tableau
adopts these various uh methods it also
has a data engine vectorization wherein
it has a in memory analytics column and
it's a faster query which helps in
reducing the extract size and creation
time so based on these that's how it can
improve the performance and that's how
it optimizes these techniques and
Tableau handles and takes care of each
of these so it performs The Parallel
query by phone it uses a particular
query faction which is short it does not
uh it shortens up all the queries the
external query caching that it uses and
also provides a data engine
vectorization where it makes this even
more quicker and faster
now in order to Quicken the process of
your loading of data what Tableau does
is it creates a saves a shadow extract
file on its own all right what it does
is uh in the repository for you to load
your data faster other than you creating
an extract it takes up the content of a
shadow extract in your repository file
and it saves it up as a shadow while
you're working on the workbook all right
and that's where then when you're
creating and working uh based on the
Legacy non Legacy excels or text files
or statistical file it creates a shadow
extract file automatically wherever you
have your repository also if you're an
aspiring data analyst looking for online
training and certifications from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simply learn Sports as
your program in data analysis from
Purdue University in collaboration with
IBM should be your right choice for more
details use the link in the description
box below and with that in mind over to
our training experts so in case when
you're working on something what it does
is in your repository folder all right
where you have your repository which is
in my documents in the data sources you
can you will be able to see that it
provides you a particular
uh extract that is or Shadow extract
that's been created and you can see that
uh it it creates a shadow extract right
there where you can make use of all
right or in the background so this is
done automatically by Tableau to Quicken
up the process this is something that
you do not need to handle uh by default
this uh the folder there is a folder
that gets created uh when you have a
proper licensed version then you will
see that in the repository folder you
will have a shadow extract folder and uh
based on that that is how uh you will
see that at least the first five at
least the top five Shadow extracts will
be uh save with the dot DT TTD extension
and that's how it uses and replaces it
replaces the oldest one so when you have
a license version in that case then
that's when you will be able to see this
extract folder and uh this is when it
quickens up the entire process let me
begin with the next topic which is
calculation all right now in terms of
calculations uh these are pretty much
sure these help us in terms of
understanding in terms of creating an
extractful meaningful result of our data
all right so sometimes it's pretty much
necessary that we make use of calculated
fees now you've already seen that I've
been making use of we created the ship
to date and I created various
calculations and I've been mentioning
that uh you know I'm going to discuss
these in detail in the next topic when
we have like we created the primary
table the secondary table I showed you
the quick table calculation so you're
already pretty much aware of how I was
using them but let us understand these
in detail now all right so let me begin
at the end of this session in terms of
when we complete this topic you are
going to understand how you can make use
of strings dates logical as well as
arithmetic calculations how you can work
with different aggregation options how
you can make use of the grand totals and
subtotals the uh quick stable
calculations which are inbuilt by
Tableau how you can create automatic and
custom splits
discovering the ad hoc analytics which
is offered by Tableau and how you can
perform the LOD that is level of details
calculation all right so let's begin
with the very first topic how you can
work with strings dates logical and
arithmetic calculations wherein you can
create a completely new field which is
not present as part of your underlying
data you can actually create that using
a specific formula there are functions
and operators provided so you can use a
string all right you can use the date
you can use logical operators or
arithmetic calculations and based on
that you can then apply certain
functions and operators and finally
create a calculation so you can create
these four kinds of calculation the
arithmetic take string and logical ones
all right so let us understand and
explore how we can use how Tableau
provides us various built-in functions
wherein we can use a calculated field
and create an arithmetic calculation so
we've seen an example where I created a
profit margin or a profit ratio in our
earlier sizes in our earlier
demonstration wherein you can use let's
say when you want to create the profit
ratio we use the sum of profit divided
by sum of sales so that's how we created
an arithmetic calculation similarly we
can create a new string calculations all
right so I'm going to show you an
example of each of these uh and then we
can also we saw right now I created the
days to ship in the earlier example for
one of our views wherein I use the date
calculation where we created the date
and we will also make use of one of
these logical calculations to see and
understand how we can make use of the
these are the logical calculation
operators and functions and make use of
these calculations so uh we have a
scenario here so before that let me move
on to our Tableau environment here right
and um
let me start showing you one of the
examples of each that we can use in
terms of creating them all right
and in here let me quickly create one
simple view so I'm going to add in so
I'm going to add in my state screw rolls
and I'm going to add sales to my columns
and quickly create one bar chart here
all right
foreign
States here all right but I also want to
know the count of distinct items all
right so in this case what I'm going to
do is let me have my product name
right because I want to know the count
of distinct items I'm going to right
click on the product name here and I'm
going to then drag and drop this to the
columns over here or right onto the
column section now because I've selected
the right click option and then Dragged
In dragged and dropped in the product
name or Dimension onto the column it
opens up the drop field as to how I want
to use it whether I want to use since I
want to use a distinct field in
analyzing all right it's opened up this
particular window of whether I want to
use the count product name or account
distinct product name all right so I'm
going to select the count distinct
because we want to distinctly analyze
the sounds of the items all right and
click on OK
all right uh what are aggregation
functions aggregation functions that's
the sum the average these are the
different aggregation functions so right
now the basic default is sum all right
so it's summing up the measure whatever
measure we've selected that's the
aggregation function so whether you want
to sum it up you want to average it out
you want to use median count minimum
maximum these are all the inbuilt
aggregation functions provided by
tableau or then you can also use the
aggregation functions when you're using
calculated C is beyond the ones provided
so those are aggregation functions
uh yes we have a bar chart I'm going to
still analyze and show these details to
you further in terms of aggregation so
what I did was instead of just using the
product name as it is I've used account
distinct all right uh could you please
drag and drop the product name or you
want me to show that to you once again
Shiva yes I'm gonna take this off my uh
columns here now when I want to add my
product name if I directly drag and drop
it onto the columns it's just going to
add up the details asking me how I want
to use it as a dimension now that's not
what I want to do because as per the
analysis I want to I want the count of
distinct items right so for that I'm
going to Simply right click on product
name and then I'm going to drag and drop
the product name onto the column so in
that it's going to then ask me what is
the aggregation I want to use on my
dimension and I want to use the count
distance you can see count product name
and count distinct product name so I'm
selecting the second option and clicking
on OK
now I want to see the CH score item sold
and this particular field is not
available in my data set so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create uh
one using my calculated field because I
want to see these scales for item all
right so let me uh right click on my
sales job all right in the database one
way of doing it is you can right click
on the drop down you have the option of
clicking on create a calculated field
all right for that specific field or in
the data pane in the drop down here it
says create calculated field okay you
can select either option when you select
the drop down for you from here it's
blank and you'll have to input the
formula when you select a particular
field and do it then in that case it
opens up and adds in the field by
default wherein then you can specify the
functions and operators so let me
specify the arithmetic calculation here
so uh the first type that I'm showing
you the very first option in terms of
calculator see the arithmetic
calculation all right okay
so let's have our
sum of sales
and
I'm going to divide this because I want
to know CS or item sold now that is the
reason I've created the count distinct
product name here so Dexter when you
mentioned using two bars the only reason
I did that was right now I'm just trying
to create account product name and once
I add in the details I'm then going to
replace the particular uh view from it
all right so I'm going to divide this
with the
counts
product name
all right so that's how we are creating
our sales for item calculation using the
arithmetic calculation method sales for
iTunes so I'm dividing the sales based
on the count distance of the product
name all right
and let me click on OK
and with that you know in the measure we
have a new measure that's added up which
is the sales score item this is this
particular calculated field I'm going to
place it is getting placed in the
measures directly because it's returning
a particular number right the numerical
value and hence is placed in measures
now let me add my sales score item into
the columns so I'm going to replace my
account product name here all right
foreign
on a distinct basis all right and I
cannot change the aggregation functions
here so notice earlier when I specified
the default function is come we can
change these aggregation functions for a
particular measure from the inbuilt ones
or we can specify it as a calculated
field now in this case it does not give
us any option to change the aggregation
function it shows it's aggregated
already because it's a calculated field
it's taking in the aggregation as we
specified in the in the arithmetic
calculation
all right so that was your example of
having your calculated arithmetic
calculated field
so here we can see the sales for item
for each state
right this kind of an example is an
arithmetic calculation
great so let's move on now we've already
seen these covered up before Skype which
was arithmetic calculation now let me
show you an example of how we can use
calculated fields and create a string
calculation all right so let's say we
want to analyze the customers beginning
with the name f or right the one that's
Illustrated in the in the slide here
which says that we will be analyzing the
customers beginning with s okay so in
this case let me add up my customer uh
name into the rules
right
and let's have profits in the columns
all right so we have customer names in
rows and columns all right
now what I'm going to do is let's
consider that at this point of time we
have a range we have a scrolling and we
have a range of customer names here and
I only let's say want to at this point
of time let's say I want to develop and
come up with a stream that all the
customer names beginning with the word s
all right they are entitled to getting
uh or a discount all right we're coming
up with a particular offer now it would
be pretty difficult if I add up the
customer name in the filter of your and
then manually select the one with s
right or I can also use the Wild Card
wherein I'm using the option to select
one with an S similarly I can also make
use of the calculated field to achieve
the same scenario
so let's click on create calculated
field let's name this as customer with s
all right customer beginning with s and
now we're going to provide now if I
expand this Arrow here you can see there
are a lot of functions provided by
Tableau in terms of number of string
dates type conversion logical aggregate
user and table calculation and that's
where uh based on that you can make use
in selection and it also specifies the
kind of requirement of any a small
definition an example preview of it all
right so in case it's difficult to
remember all the aggregations it's
difficult to understand how it's created
you can simply click on the uh type and
that's how you can come up with uh the
definitions of these as well right so
let's have the function starts with
because we want all the customer names
starting with
and we wanted for customer name
beginning with
s
now in terms of the calculation it's
telling us there is a particular error
so let's find out does that
all right and now my calculation is
valid I have my customers beginning with
s all right I'm creating a calculator
field and click on ok now this is going
to bring in a string function so when I
click on OK it adds up a Boolean logical
to and false uh data type and it adds it
up to the dimensions because it is
related it is based on the string
functions here for the customers all
right so uh this is how we have a
calculated key selected and let me this
time add up the customers with s into
the filter
all right and now it gives me the option
of true and false all right whether I
want to include it whether it's true or
false and let's say I'm going to say
that I want to include that particular
option with the customer name beginning
with
all right and we do not see data here
let's just get what is the problem yeah
this is excluding our data let's just
give me a moment
we have our customers let me quickly
edit
starts with customer name as
and this is absolutely okay
all right so we have the true and false
option and we want it true as the
customer's name beginning with s and
click on OK and we now see a list of
customers name that is beginning only
with the letter N all right uh
Jacqueline uh starts with customer name
so this is how we can make use of the
string as calculation all right
next now let us see how we can make use
of the date calculation now we've
already performed this kind of a
calculation so I'm going to explain uh
in terms of the date calculation when we
wrote in the days to ship what what each
of it uh mental right when we wanted to
analyze the difference
uh yes it's going to be case sensitive
in that case today you're absolutely
right so uh in case if it's not a lower
case it's not going to take in the
function Tableau somehow has a case
sensitivity and it only takes in a
lowercase
uh I saw that example to you so when
you're saying that uh you know in in
terms of the letter s it's not going to
be case sensitive for the uh alphabet
because you always think customer names
beginning with the alphabet F in this
case it's not but overall it's case
sensitive I'll just show you that
example in terms of the date
calculations right away
so going back on our Tableau sheet here
we have the dates to ship that we've
already created so I'm just going to
click on edit now in this case uh if you
notice the date difference uh what needs
to be specified for a date difference is
there are three parts to this all right
so let's say now we wanted to analyze
the number of days it took from for the
order to get shipped all right so in our
data set we already have the order date
we have the ship date
all right and we want to calculate how
uh the number of days uh is required in
terms of shipping the product so uh I've
used in the date difference function and
in this case then we need to use there
are three input that comes into picture
all right there are three cases here so
the first one is wherein you want to
specify what part what role is it going
to play all right it's going to play the
role of a day because I'm finding out on
the basis of day you can add it as week
month depending on the role that you
want to play and then the difference
between those two values that you want
to subtract the difference that you want
to have between these two so we have the
auto date and ship date now if the same
day you can see the calculation is valid
now let me change this to day
and you can see that it shows an error
in the calculation so in this case it
needs to be a lowercase that's when the
case sensitivity is uh it takes an
effect and it's going to throw in an
error in case if you're going to write
that right in terms of the first
parameter all right uh it's not going to
be case sensitive because you're always
specifying the customer name here so
you're picking up it from the customer
name what is the letter alphabet that
this letter should take up all right
but in terms of the date shift to date
calculation fees you need to it's case
sensitive where it only works with lower
cases because you're specifying what
part is it going to play the day to ship
uh what part when it's playing terms of
the difference it's going to play the
part of day
all right so that's how you can create
the days to ship and you can make use of
the date functions and you can create a
date calculations all right that's how
we had the date to ship option and we
can make use of it also it was not
present in our data and we can analyze
our entire data here in terms of
creating the days to ship
so that was your days to ship date
calculation similarly then you have the
logical calculation all right so I'm
going to show you an example of uh how
you can use the condition or a logical
calculation and use them in terms
different analysis so let me go back to
our environment here let me create a new
sheet
now let's see let me give you a scenario
here that we want to highlight all these
subcategories that have sales of more
than 100 000 all right so for that we're
going to create a calculated field that
will only specify the sales of
subcategories of 100 000 and above so
let's create the calculated field let's
give it a name as sales kpi and now this
is where we're going to provide logical
functions and operators and let me enter
the syntax so I'm saying if my sum of
sales
so with the bracket if my sum of sales
is
greater than
a hundred thousand
then
hi
as
foreign
yes it is and I'm going to now create a
sales kpi so that I can highlight the
subcategories having sales more than 100
000 at high and low all right let me
click on OK
and now we have the sales kpi that's
added up to the measures but we've used
you can see uh although it's a measure
it's showing the ABC icon here in terms
of the data type because we have it as
high and low measure zero all right so
in terms of the expected let's say the
expected output here and see how we can
make use of it so I'm going to add in
okay
my
subcategory
into the columns and let me add my
sales
into
my sales kpi into the room
right and
or rather I can add up or let me add
sales to my roles all right and this is
where now when I want to highlight uh
that's how I can create the calculated
field and add it up in the colors so
that it can distinguish between high and
low so I'm adding up the sales kpi into
the colors and now we can distinguish
that the kpi one which is about 100
000 it's high or then low so these are
the ones we can identify between high
and low the alerts that we can make use
of
is it considering the order date minus
ship date or ship date minus order date
uh minus referring to minus uh one
second let me just open up the ship date
uh when you're saying
uh it is ordered it minus the ship date
right
so that is what it's going to refer to
because whatever is the order date minus
the ship date that's how we're going to
get the date difference right the dates
took to ship
excellent all right uh yes I am at sales
kpi let me open that up in terms of
editing if you want to edit that
particular
yes
uh Delete uh you asked me to open up the
Cs kpi there you are
can we use a multiple condition uh in
terms of multiple condition if you're
saying that uh High average and moderate
is that what you're saying like let's
say you want to say that if uh sales is
thousand then it should be high uh
Airship sales is uh eight eighty
thousand then it should be moderate or
low then you can use the Airship
operator that's how you can add up the
Airship operator and make use of the the
detailing that else if sales is uh
greater than or less than 80 000 then
create it as
so you can use that multiple option now
only thing is you need to use the lsip
option then in this case
yeah you can use multiple conditions
like uh let's say let me quickly show
that example to you
so if you create a calculated field here
uh you can use a case in which you can
mention the East West or low right so
you can use different kinds of examples
and cases and scenarios where you can
mention uh the different sales and
budget that if my sales is so much then
it should be you know that particular
date or else you can use multiple
functions that's not going to be a
problem
all right
so this is going to be an example of
your
logical operator
we have our next topic which is working
with aggregation options all right now
this again you've noticed a couple of
times that by defaults we have our
calculation wherein Tableau takes in the
default calculation all right being the
sum but uh you can change these
aggregation functions you can see an
entire list that Tableau provides to us
right and that's how you can make use of
these aggregated functions that is your
uh whether you want to have a summation
whether you want to have an average all
right so there are different
mathematical functions your that you can
see and these each will produce a
particular aggregated data all right so
these are what are called your
aggregation functions all right and
these will help you perform the kind of
aggregation the kind of calculation that
you want to perform on that particular
field so you can make use of these
functions all right and
so now understand one thing you can use
uh Tableau to set up your aggregations
only for measures in your relational
data sources all right in terms of a
multi-dimensional data source it
contains the aggregated data already all
right so it provides you these list of
predefined aggregation floor as you can
see so let's understand each of these
functions now when it comes to an
attribute all right in this case this is
going to be returning the value of your
expression which has a single value for
that row all right so let's say let me
move to the environment here to
understand and explain what these
particular functions are all right I'm
going to pick up uh and discuss a few of
them now let's say we have sales all
right sales by default when we talk
about
the aggregation function so you need to
right click and go to default properties
and you have the aggregation option
where you can see some it's set to
default you can change these default
properties to the aggregation that you
wish to which are present here all right
you can have an average you can have a
median account a count distinct and then
various other options present here right
so when it comes to using an attribute
all right or the absolute aggregation
function as specified then in that case
it's going to return the value all right
of the expression as one particular
value of the row okay so uh in this case
it shows the field then changes to a
text I can attribute where it ignores
any kind of null value if it's present
okay so you can basically make user page
when you want to only pull in let's say
values of all the rows uh which is
otherwise displayed as a different uh
different values in it okay so so that's
when you can make use of it now that is
not present here in this case as you can
see as an app to do that comes in handy
when you're using calculated Fields all
right so let's say when you open up a
calculator
you will see you have the attribute
which is termed as attr the attribute
expression let's say we're saying the
absolute of sales so you can notice it
gives you the entire definition it
Returns the value of the expression or
if it only has a single value for all
the rows in that group and in case if
not then in that case it will display it
as an asterisk sign so that's what it
does it it's useful basically this
aggregation is useful when you want to
aggregate a particular Dimension all
right let's say we have customer name we
want to Aggregate and come on to the
number the names are the total number of
customers that you have so in that case
it will only return single values of
that row it's not a little otherwise
just say as an asterisk so that's when
this kind of a function comes in handy
for us uh not that you cannot use it
with the measures but just an example of
the best use when you want to aggregate
a particular Dimension and you want null
values to be ignored you want to know
the single values of all the rows then
this particular uh aggregation a
function is going to be helpful all
right then in terms of your next one you
have then you have Dimensions now these
again will return all the unique values
all right in your measures or Dimensions
both so it's going to only bring in all
the unique values here in this case and
in terms of sum we are already aware in
terms of average then you have median
now this is again to do with it's going
to return the median of the numbers in
the measure then you have count and
count distinct all right so count is
going to ideally return the number of
rows in your measure or Dimension and uh
if that case null values are again going
to be ignored but in terms of term
distinct it's going to return the number
of unique values so count will return
all the values the number of values
which are present but in terms of sound
distinct it will return the unique
values in a measure or Dimension all
right so that's how you have various
aggregation functions and to know
details of each of these you can make
use of the uh Tableau provides the
details about each of these because your
variousness you can see your various
inbuilt functions there's an entire list
of functions that you can make use of
and uh anywhere you need to know
additional details now these are the
basic ones that you can see the inbuilt
ones so if you want additional
aggregation functions as well you can
make use of these functions from the
calculated field and each of these has
its explanation provided but in terms of
the basic usage one the ones that you
can change it to default here's a basic
list that tablet provides so it has uh
additional functions as well but that's
when you'll have to then open up the
calculated field and make use of those
functions
so that was your aggregation function
all right
then comes in your brand totals and
subtotals if again we're already aware
we've seen this in our earlier examples
that we are able to make use of our
totaling option we are able to add in
the grand totals as well as subtotals of
the data wherein we can see the grid
that is displaying the subtotals
right you can see the grand total right
here and you can see the subtotals for
each category level as well and the
grand total across every uh sub category
for this particular category towards its
particular Year all right now to enable
your grand totals you can simply go to
the analysis menu so you've seen that in
our earlier examples as well and uh
that's where you can go to the analysis
totals and you can make use of and have
your totals enabled so that's how you
can have your total now coming on to a
quick stable calculation let me now
discuss on this because uh the other
topics for recap that we've been
performing now you've also seen that
they were instances when I performed
with table calculations all right so
these are basically calculated Fields
when we apply a particular cancellation
at a data set level all right so Tableau
provides certain functionalities it
provides certain
a functionalities here in terms of
applying the calculation at your table
level so as the name suggests table
calculations it allows us to provide
that kind of functionality whereas it
computes the uh applied uh values all
right in your entire table and this is
basically dependent on the structure the
table structure that you have in your
view okay so that's how you can make use
of table calculations and what tableau
it provides some input functions which
are usually uh in use it revises as an
in-bit quick function where you do not
have to input any kind of formulas in
those functions you can simply click on
those options and it's going to
immediately compute the entire range
specified that you're selecting all
right so let's see one of the examples
so I'm going to take you to the
environment here
and let's have our order date in columns
let's have our sales and rules
and let me just enable the labels as
well all right so that's created a line
view since it's a series over time uh so
if you remember in the chart type the
best uh example is to make use the best
references to make use of a line graph
and hence Tableau automatically creates
a line chart here for us all right now
we have the yearly sales as we can see
all right now
let me add sales again to the rows so
what I'm going to do is we can see two
uh sales calculations here so what I'm
going to do is with the second
calculation I'm going to in the drop
down you have a quick table calculation
consisting of all your detailed
calculations here as you can see so you
have these running totals so this is
going to show you a cumulative total all
right then you have the difference so
this is in terms of showing you the
entire difference about uh some absolute
change between the measures that you
have all right then you have the percent
difference so this will give you
difference in terms of a percent value
all right it shows you the uh difference
in terms of those options as a percent
then you have percent of total so this
is going to give you the values as a
percent to the entire process so what is
the contribution of each year in this
case to the entire total uh that you
have in terms of the contribution all
right the sales then you have Brands so
this is going to rank our values
numerically we have percentile which is
going to compute our values in a
percentile manner we have moving average
this is going to calculate the
fluctuations in terms of identifying uh
any long-term Trend all right then your
today titles or then you have compound
growth rates year over year all right so
there are various such functions that
you can see here which are provided by
Tableau right now I'm going to change
and uh use the percent of total all
right so this is going to give us the
values of the percent for every year
that it is contributing towards the
entire total what each year is
contributing so let's click on percent
to total
and now we can see here the second sales
Bill there is a calculation icon dose in
terms of the triangle icon that you can
see which says that is performed or
table calculation on the second sales
Bill all right
uh so in that case we can now see the
percent to sales for all the years what
is the contribution all right so that
was a quick table calculation where it
allows us to apply based on our
requirements the defined functions we
can simply click and view those
calculations instantly in our view all
right and now in a lot of cases we might
want to customize these calculations so
that's when then you can have your
additional table calculations that you
can manually perform all right
in terms of moving now uh when we're
talking of moving average or any kind of
moving function all right here let's say
moving average but this is one of the
calculations so it can be a moving
average or any other calculation where
is moving cancellations will ideally
show us a fluctuation or fluctuations
that we can identify in terms of Long
Branch all right so that is what moving
calculations are so we will see an
example of this of what are moving
calculations and that's how you'll be
able to understand the difference of
what these are right and again like I
said to understand these in details we
can also make use of the
aggregation functions the calculator see
where it can give us the entire
detailing right so this was a quick
example let me add this as a quick
stable
calculation
now next as I mentioned these are in bit
ones that we made use of but there are
times where we might want to customize
these tables all right so in this case
let's have our order date back in
columns let's have our sales in rows
right we've again created a view let's
have
uh now in this case I'm not going to add
in another pin I'm going to perform the
calculation on the sales Bill itself
that we have here right so you're on the
sales pin now instead of quick table I'm
going to select on ADD table calculation
because we want to provide a customized
one so if you've seen an example earlier
when we wanted to build in a Pareto
chart or other kind of charts where we
made use the stable calculation right it
calculated our data in terms of
calculations across at the table level
so let us understand how these
calculations come into picture how they
compute the values of the table level
all right so these are the drop downs
again provided in terms of the functions
the computations that we want to make
use of and apply to the rows in our
database to calculate our values all
right so let's say I'm going to select
running total this time all right
and instead of the uh how do I want to
summarize so I want these running total
and you're again whether I want it as a
sum as an average a minimum or a maximum
let's say I'm going to pick up average
so what we're doing is we're going to be
seeing our sales as an average running
total Year all right and in terms of
running along whether you want it across
the table a particular cell all right or
a particular field in this case so we
can uh specify now since we have ordered
it and our view is giving us the option
to select from the available view so
let's have it running uh across and
let's have it across the order date all
right so that's how we can select each
of these different uh requirements and
compute the value that we want to
perform
right so that's how we can have these
computings that are taking place right
so
when you talk of table across then in
this case it computes the entire table
it will compute the entire table across
here that we can see in terms of uh the
tables here which are present in our
view all right when we talk about uh
calculating in terms of these cells all
right then in that case it's going to
pick up uh the individual cells present
in our room all right so in this we are
addressing to the individual cells which
are present now uh had I changed this to
a table view then that's when we would
specifically talk about let's say we
were at a year level and we had
aggregated this at the quarter level or
let me just change that option and
social so that or you'll get a better
idea let's have this at a quarter level
all right and let's say let me add in
region as well
now in this case we would be talking
about individual when we talk of table
calculations happening at 10 levels
we're talking of an individual level all
right so we are talking of four 2011 for
the central region for quarter one all
right so I wanted to address individual
sales and perform the calculations right
so that is what would be the cell level
our then I can select an individual
field so that's when we were selecting
the order date and in that case we could
select a particular field and mention
that it needs to compute at that
particular field that I'm specifying all
right so I'm just going to undo and go
back to our previous View where we were
performing our table calculation and we
selected the running total
we had our summation summarizing at
average and we selected a particular
field all right and let's click on OK
let me enable the data label so your now
we can see a calculation where it's
performing or running average of sales
year for us now all right now in the
same case let's say we want to also have
a secondary now that was our basic
calculation now let's say I want to
perform another calculation I want to
apply it to this particular table so
then we can also apply a secondary
calculation in that case wherein we can
combine two calculations and we can
perform one on one of these calculations
so let me on the drop down you have the
option of edit table calculation of
clearance so let's click on edit and
this is where you can see the checkbox
that says perform a secondary
calculation on the result so what have
you will do is it is first calculate
this particular uh primary calculation
that you have all right the basic
calculation basic table calculation that
you're providing once you compute this
particular calculation it will then
perform a secondary calculation a second
calculation on this particular result
all right so that's how it's going to
then compute and combine two
calculations in this case so in the
second example let's say let me specify
[Music]
um
let's have the difference from let's
keep it to a basic so the first we want
it as the running total once it's given
us the average running total I then
wanted to perform a secondary
calculation on the running average of
sales where I want to know the
difference from in terms of what is the
calculation that I want it to provide
all right so let's again keep it at the
level of
um let's select order date again all
right so again I wanted to perform at a
particular field and what is the level
that I want to specify so you're in this
case since we are mentioning the order
date do I want it at the deepest level
all right the granular level or do I
want to specify it at a particular
yearly quarterly monthly or daily level
or the entire aggregate of the order
date so let's say I'm going to specify
at a yearly level that I wanted to
select all right and let's click on OK
so it's now performed a secondary
calculation based on the previous one
and that's how we can make use this is
useful when we want to perform our
calculations to our data in the tables
and instead of a single calculation
there might be times there are instances
where we might want to combine two
calculations so that's how you can make
use of the basic and the calculations in
terms of having a secondary one as well
so let's say uh you want to calculate
the year-to-date growth all right and
once you have the year-to-date growth
then based on that you might want to
then compute that once I have that
calculation I should get the percent
difference for each total in the
previous year so then that's how you can
apply and make use of your secondary
calculations all right now you can also
customize these calculations all right
so we have the option as I mentioned you
can go to the edit selection and that's
where you can edit your tables and have
the editing provided
and we have a scenario here now
company and they want to increase their
market share
all right and uh in this case they want
to uh ensure that they're having higher
profit margins all right so what uh what
Jennifer needs to do is she needs to
ensure her company's sustainability and
then she needs to identify the
opportunity for business and how she can
make the most of it right
right for this she needs to determine
these sales variants for your over your
based on a quarterly breakdown so let us
achieve this particular scenario now to
achieve these as Jennifer what is
Jennifer going to require to do all
right so let's pause quickly on our
notepad add in our requirements so for
us to achieve this particular scenario
for Jennifer yo what we're going to be
doing is firstly we will create now
since we are going to talk about uh year
over year we are talking about time
based analysis we will create a line
chart right so we will have a line chart
in terms of our sales based on order
level
next tends to further proceed with the
scenario now we need it at a quarterly
breakdown so we are going to drill and
we're going to drill out of quarterly
levels
foreign
calculation because we want to know the
sales variance for your over yours
growth all right so hence we will create
a table calculation
and this is going to be in case of
difference because we want to know the
the difference the variance for your
over your growth for our sales
all right so let's achieve this
particular scenario going to the
environment and let's begin with our
analysis here all right
let me have my order date as mentioned
at a yearly level let's have our sales
all right and that is or we that creates
our line chart we are done next we need
to drill at a quarterly level all right
so let's drill our data and have a
quarter day levels
right and finally then let us now have
now we need to perform we can see the
sales and now we need to know the
variance the difference all right we
want to know uh we want to create a
table calculation with difference so I'm
going to add in another instance of
sales here to our rows on which we
perform our calculations all right and
and now I'm going to make use of the
quick stable cancellation because we
want to know the variance the difference
for year over year right so in this case
uh I've dragged my second pill and let's
have it at our
uh the difference level here all right
so we can see the difference now that is
one way but if you notice it's still a
little difficult in case of judging the
entire view here all right so what I'm
going to do is uh to make of you better
let's have our sales fill all right from
the brochures let's add it up to the
color shell so what it's going to do is
on the existing sales view is going to
identify and distinguish between the
colors for the difference that we have
and that's how we'll be able to identify
the difference so let me just drag and
drop it and we can now see our view
where we can identify our sales and the
difference which is based on its color
the red the darker the size the
difference of sales is our analysis
yourself that it's in minus all right
and in terms of a Greener so differences
on a higher side with cream right so
that's how when you hover as well at a
quarterly level you can see that for
2007 we we have a particular sales and
its difference that we can see all right
in terms of the previous table
so that's how you can make use of your
calculations and Achieve our scenario so
let's name this as sales analysis right
so that's how we are able to achieve and
have these sales variants of year over
year that we can notice the growth and
based on that we saw the quarterly
breakdown as well where she can now
identify the growth opportunities for
business right so that's how we can make
use of table calculations
would you move ahead with understanding
what are box plots all right so in terms
of Doc plots now these are used when we
want to compare a set of data all right
and when we want to ideally analyze a
distribution of data which is
highlighted up to five key values all
right within our data so that's a box
plot what it usually is also known as a
box and whisker plot all right and it
helps us in seeing the distribution of
the values along the axis all right so
the boxes here that you can see please
indicate the middle fifty percent of our
data all right and uh
then we can also configure you can see
these this curves or lines as you can
see these these called these lines and
uh these display all the points within
uh 1.5 percent of the range so let me
show that to you all each of these in uh
the slides here so there are five key
values that is represented in the box
plot the first it shows us the minimum
value all right second it shows us the
25 percent quartile all right then it
shows us the median
the 75 quartile
at the maximum value all right so that's
how it highlights up to five key values
within the data all right so we have the
Shaded box all right in the example that
uh
denote these five values let me go back
on the previous slide here so the boxes
here is what is representing over here
you can see these are representing the
50 of our data all right so these shaded
boxes the the light and dark gray these
are called quartiles all right so namely
we have the upper quartile and lower
quartile so the lower quartile this
starts at 25 of the data set and the
upper quartile it starts at 75 percent
of our data set all right so these two
boxes these contain the middle fifty
percent of our data all right and the
lines here these are called your viscous
this can be configured to stretch to
your uh maximum extent of data or within
a 1.5 times of the interquartile range
that is all the points within a 1.5
percent is what you can make use of all
right so this is where uh we understood
so we have the minimum values all right
we have these 25 percent
that is 25 of the data set the median
the 75 quartile of our data set
and then the maximum value so let's see
how we can create a box plot I'm
switching to the Tableau environment
here adding in a new sheet
and
so let me have my
segments added in to the columns
then we have my profits added up to
the rules
and let me have my
Auto dates
into the details section
right
let me ensure that
this is a discrete date value
now let me if I click on the access
viewer and say let me add a reference
line
and this is where when I right click on
my Axis I have the options now we will
be discussing all these uh lines in
terms of the topic statistics when we
try and understand reference lines bands
and distribution but to create a box
plot we can click right click on the
axis and uh go on to the reference line
and choose the box plot option now this
is where you can specify the whisker
extending to your within the data within
the 1.5 percent or the maximum extent of
the data right the minimum and at
maximum that we were talking about the
style of how you want it to look like
The Spill color let's uh pick up a red
color all right the borders and how you
want your whiskers the thickness the
lines that you want it to be and click
on OK
so with that it's created a desktop box
plot here for us it's providing us with
the viscose and the lines
in terms of the segments here all right
uh let's say you can also do this in
terms of having your particular analysis
uh creating these box plots by adding
some more additional data and detailing
as well all right let me show you uh one
more example of a box plot all right
this is a very simple one so it's pretty
much where we're only trying to analyze
based on the uh segments you are in the
profits where it's created a box plot
and giving us each of these segments and
the profits for its particular year now
let me show you one more example of a
box plot to understand the five values
that it picks up all right so let's have
our segment added up to the columns and
let's have let's use discounts this time
so what we're going to do is I'm going
to create a box plot view that's going
to show us the discount based on our
segments and regions all right so let's
add in the discount onto the rules all
right
uh let me have my
region as well so
they have region and let me have this
added up to the column right here next
to the segment so it created a nested
level again based on every segment for
its own region what is the discount here
all right so we have two levels of
hierarchies of our Dimension right from
our left to right within every region
that you can see you're listed
now let me go to the show me option and
let's change this now another way of
changing that was we can also go to the
show me option and click on the box and
disco plot view here all right so one
way was I right click and I selected the
reference lines and I selected the box
plot option or another way of doing it
is click on the show me option and click
on the viscore and box plot or charts
that you have here
right so your now this has given us the
entire view displaying a box plot where
we can see uh all the marks here in each
box that has been plotted up so it
assigned the regions here uh as you can
see in terms we can see the regions and
uh in the columns from The Mark shelf
right remember that there would be
regions which is placed in the columns
as soon as we selected on box plot it
automatically assigned a region on the
columns itself here in the marks card it
reassigned it let me just undo this
option so this is how we had a nisted
bar graph created when I go to the show
me option and click on box plots notice
that region from The Columns will get
added up to the mark section here okay
there you go you can see that it's got
added up here so basically when we
change it from a bar or from any chart
type to a box plot then Tableau is
determining uh the individual marks in
the plot that it should represent so
it's determining that the Mark here that
we have should be represented based on
region all right so well uh you can
change that as well so let's have our
region dragged back onto our column all
right so we want it at a regional level
here and uh based on uh for every
segments in every region now we can see
a horizontal line that is created a
flattened box plot here in this case all
right which is uh the reason being that
it's right now giving us a value based
on a single Mark all right now box plot
as the description as the definition
says it is intended to show us the
distribution of our data right now
What's Happening Here is it is
aggregating the entire data and the
current View and you can see a flattened
view of flattened
so we want to disaggregate our measures
in that matter we want we want to uh we
want to have our aggregation uh level
changed and disaggregate our data where
it can give us an entire distribution of
our data so here in the analysis menu
click on the analysis menu you can see
aggregated measures that's been enabled
I'm going to uncheck this option and by
this I'm going to turn off the
aggregation all right so I'm going to
disaggregate the measures here so that
we can now see that the data which has
is at a disaggregated level wherein we
can Now understand each of these uh
marks instead of a single Mark we are
able to view each of the marks for every
column in a range of the data source
that we have all right now to uh see and
View and understand some additional
information here to make this more
readable make this more appealing what
I'm going to do is I'm going to swap our
axis here and I'm going to make this
into a horizontal view all right so that
it's going to be easier see it's going
to be easier for us to compare every
segment the region for every segment uh
what are the discounts that have been
offered all right now let me let's add
some additional analysis to this as well
so at the bottom axis we have the
discount here I'm going to Simply go on
to the edit axis that we have we have
the option to edit the reference lines
you can see the reference lines and
automatically there's a box plot that
has been selected so we can edit these
reference lines and change the entire
banding and the colors as you remember
so let's select something more
interesting from a library let's select
a red one or you can also select on the
transparency level so let's add up the
transparency level to let's say 80 all
right uh let's stick to the borders as
it is and the viscous as uh uh the
default and click on OK right now with
that we can see that the discount is
pretty much the same all right the
discount is pretty much the same with uh
for all the segments so if you notice in
terms of whenever we're seeing all the
best all right the discount are pretty
much the same for all the segments right
also if you're an aspiring data analyst
looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learn Sports Azure program in
data analysis from for your University
in collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below and
with that in mind over to our training
experts
so that is one analysis that we can see
also we can see that the interquartile
range that is the 25 to the 75 percent
of the discount we have the central
region and that is showing us the
highest range all right so uh this is
how we're able to identify and uh see
the highest ranges here so each of it is
representing the entire detailing that
you can see here so the box is here all
right these boxes are representing the
50 of our data then again these are
divided as the 2.25 quartile and 75
quartile and then we have the visco
values which are configured based on the
maximum and minimum the reference lines
that we have the maximum uh are the
maximum and the minimum values in terms
of the interquartile greens all right so
that is your box plot so the box here
the one in the center these are
indicating the 50 of the data and again
you can see two quartiles two
distributions of the data all right and
then the whiskers which is showing us
the quartiles in terms of the minimum
maximum of 1.5
so let me take you back to the
presentation slides so we have the
maximum value
we have
the 75 quartile that we saw
the median the 25 and the minimum value
so that was an example of box plot
now formatting as we already know as we
are aware is a very important part of
both our analysis as well as our
presentation all right everything that
you see that you view in your sheet you
want to ensure that there is a proper
formatting applied that are shading
fonts lines and borders all of this
makes a lot of difference when it comes
to how you want to present and view your
data all right so it is pretty important
and hence in this particular chapter
we're going to be discussing on
different formatting options that are
available how we can format our
visualizations how we can make use of
the colors the uh worksheet themes in
terms of resizing in terms of working
with labels the mark sites all right and
we're also going to discuss on
annotations on how we can make use of
annotations and annotate a particular
value right so let us explore what I'm
gonna do is in this particular topic as
I have already mentioned we will
describe and understand what is spatial
analysis someone had also raised a
concern on day one as to what spatial
analysis was so I'm gonna discuss that
topic right away and that's going to
resolve and fall out on your question
then we are also going to understand how
we can make use of titles captions and
Tool tips and how we can format access
as well as how we can format our views
and results as well as use Mark labels
and annotations all right so let me
directly move on uh before I proceed
here
uh let me now move to the Tableau
environment here and click on the new
sheet now talking about spatial analysis
facial analysis is what is related to
your Geographic data all right so
Tableau works now how it works with
fields in a special manner Tableau also
also with the geographic fields in a
special your Nano it gives spatial data
some special importance it automatically
assigns Geographic roles to any data
that you have in your data source so if
you notice I had discussed this
yesterday write in your data source it
can identify if there is any kind of
data related to geography it
automatically assigns it with a
geographic role all right so that is the
specialty of Tableau in case it is not
able to identify in terms of the uh
analysis whether it is a geographic role
or not then you also still have the
option wherein you can click on the data
source and describe the kind of
geographic role that you want to assign
all right you can customize the role as
well whether this particular country and
option is or area code is a city is a
county is a state Province right so you
have the option so you can keep it to
default and the data type as well so you
can customize on the spatial data and
something very interesting thing about
Tableau for that matter with the related
to spatial data Geographic data is let
me take you on to the sheet and
regarding mappings all right we're going
to have a detailed discussion on
maths and how we can create Maps but uh
let me since we're talking about facial
analysis and since I mentioned it
automatically identifies Geographic data
let me show you how it treats the
geographic data so URL you can see we
have the country all right and we can
see it is already identified it as a
geographic data provided a globe sign
when I double click on country
all right what Tableau does it it
automatically as you saw adds in the
longitude and the latitude for the
country it automatically generates the
latitude and longitude all right and
that's how you can see the map now these
are different layers and WMS maps that
you can make use of so uh we are going
to discuss this pretty much in detail
when we come on to the maps chapter
but as you saw the moment I double
clicked on Country it automatically
added in the land longitude and the
latitude into the columns in rows so
that's how Tableau treats uh spatial
data that's how it works with Geographic
data all right so coming on to
discussing with the formatting I'm going
to take a new sheet here now formatting
as I mentioned there are various ways
various types of formatting that you can
perform all right so uh let's let's talk
on the most uh common ones in terms of
how you can open the formatting pane in
the very first place uh the formatting
option that you have all right so for
that let me quickly create one view for
you all let's have category and let's
have sales
all right and now you can see that you
have the format menu pairing when you
click on the format menu it gives you
all the options whether you want to
format the fonts you want to format the
alignments the shadings the borders the
lines if you want to format a reference
line if it's in your view drop line
annotations titles and captions scale
labels so these are all the options in
terms of how you want to format so this
is the entire uh window these are the
entire options that I'm going to be
discussing about so in terms of how to
enable the format say in the very first
place is that the moment you click on a
format here all right and you select a
particular option let's say I'm going to
say I'm going to format the font in the
view all right because of that notice
what happened did you see attention the
data pane here got replaced with the
format sale so that's how it opens up
the format page and then you can see all
these same options in the drop down here
that you've seen Down your points
alignments shading borders and lines you
can format your fonts your alignments
shading your borders and lines so in
your view you can select whether you
want to format the font whether you want
to format the lines you want to provide
a shading you want to provide a border
or you want to provide any line
formatting and again in that there are
three tabs for every option that you
will choose right so this means Tableau
allows you
to either format your particular font or
shading or bordering or coloring for the
entire sheet or you can also do it for a
particular row or a column
all right so it gives you that option or
you can select a particular field as
well whether you want the format a
particular field
now in terms of the font here you can
see you can choose whether on the
worksheet what is the font you want the
pane the header the totals how you want
your totals to resemble the grand totals
now these are visible and worked when
you have text tables
kind of a view
similarly you can format your rows so
that Grays out the worksheet option and
allows you options in terms of
formatting your roles and the same
option for columns
for your phones all right so let's say
I'm going to have my
worksheet wherein I'm going to have my
header
increase to the size of 16.
and let's have
a greenish shade added to it we need a
little more darker color to it there we
go so we formatted the headers and the
values in our view all right
so that's how you can format the font
then comes in the alignment in terms of
how you want again based on sheet rows
and columns all right whether you want
to align the pane as horizontal all
right whether you want to align it as
left right or Central aligned all right
in terms of the direction of your text
so in case let's say you have a lot of
data you can change the direction of
your text
uh whether you want it vertical or
whether you want to wrap up your text
all right so those are to do with the
alignments that you have and that's how
you can align the row The Columns or the
entire sheet so in terms of horizontal
you can control whether the text aligns
to the left right or the center
all right in terms of the vertical
option you will control whether your
text aligns on top all right in the
middle or at the bottom
so top middle or bottom in terms of the
text alignment then coming on to
Direction how you want the direction of
your text whether you wanted to run
automatic or so it will take in based on
the kind of data is there in your view
or you want to keep it to normal up or
down all right that is top to bottom or
bottom to down
and uh then based on the wraps whether
you want to use when you have long
headers then whether you want to have a
text wrap that needs to be taken place
or take care of so whether it's offer on
you can select on the options and each
of these uh effects and options will
take place on your sheet depending on
the kind of view and visualization all
right so that was to do with your uh
alignments coming on to formatting the
shading this is to do with you can
format using the shading command you can
control the background color of your
Pane and header all right so again you
can decide whether you want to apply it
on the entire sheet the rows or the
columns so you can let's say in the
sheet select that in terms of the
background I need it to be a little
lightish in terms of a lightish pink so
let's put in the shading so that's how
based on the worksheet the total row
banding all right so you can actually
have a Band-Aid in terms of when you
have a text kind of a table you can then
perform a row banding so let's say let's
choose a text table
you can see that you can take off the
shading keep it to none and then you can
provide the kind of banding size that
you want this is the size of two you can
change it you will think the sliders are
not banding based on every three values
let's add sub categories so that it
makes you view a little more easier to
understand
so let us just use the
hierarchy drill down
go back to formatting
and now this is happening after every
third value in terms of the band size
the levels as well we can decide on the
levels and in terms of the column
banding as well how do we want it all
right so we can change the levels of the
banding
okay
then you have the Allah in terms of
formatting in terms of border so you can
format the borders in your view wherein
you can decide on you know formatting
these cells the paint the header the
totals you want to divide the particular
row or divide the particular column all
right you can make use of these as well
in terms of Divisions wanting to have a
clear a better View
all right
if you can see we've divided it you want
a thicker line
all right in terms of column dividers as
well
how do you want it the view that you
want to select
all right so that's how you can format
your borders as well and finally comes
in the option in terms of
your lines how do you want your line
format setting all right you can control
the nine set of your in a graph now in
that case you will have to change the
view to a different kind of graph and
then that's where you can decide using
every toolbar whether you want to see
grid lines all right you want to see the
dotted lines is there a particular color
that we want to add in
all right
or thickness needed not needed
trend lines now when you enable so when
we come out to trend line topics is
where we'll discuss but once you've
added a trend line to your view as well
you can format how you want your trend
line the color that you want to choose
if you've added in a reference line a
draw price you can make these options
available in terms of formatting in
terms of the access
how do you want it to be you want it as
none
or you want to provide a particular
dotted line to it right
so that's how the edu will keep changing
depending on the kind of view that you
have all right so that's how you can
format the lines as well in your view
you can also format a particular part or
right now in
uh we saw we sort of format the entire
sheet or the row of column in terms of
fonts in terms of alignments in terms of
shadings in terms of borders and lines
we can also format a particular field as
I mentioned so you can format the fields
in terms of how you want your fields to
look like in terms of let's say you can
click here and you have the option of
format which will directly open up the
field as what you want to do in terms of
the header or the fail all right we have
the size let's reduce it this time to
14. and let us change the color of it
let's have a bluish color so we are
seeing the headers now are changing in
terms of the header for our category
all right so that's how we can choose
the formatting option here whether we
want to do it for the pain all right the
font whether you want to change that and
change the color
so that's how you can perform it on a
particular field as well
all right now in terms of formatting
numbers we had a question whether can we
format and specify a particular option
in terms of numbers as well uh yes you
can if you can directly have uh this
option where you can right click again
and click on format which will give you
the option in how you want the fonts
again for this particular field which is
sales it's giving you that you're
formatting it for sales the scale the
number format where you want to use it
as automatic or standard number or
custom number a currency so there was a
question put up where uh we were asked
uh can we format the currency so you
have your answer or your question has
been answered right here in terms of
formatting all right so uh there we go
we can also format in terms of the
numbering options as to how we want to
format it based on uh the options here
for number format I will let you know
each of these options so automatic is uh
Tableau will automatically format the
number based on the uh format specified
in the data source or the data are
contained in that particular field all
right in terms of number standard it
will take in the format which is based
on your local that is selected the kind
of Locale that you have selected are the
geographic location that you have it is
formatted based on that standard setting
in terms of custom your you can
customize it as per your liking so let's
say instead of writing let me use a
notepad you want to show you all so
let's say instead of writing 20 000 we
want to show it as 20K uh you can use
the custom formatting and that's how
important 20 000 you can use and write
it as 20K so you can use the custom
option in that uh for that manner in
terms of numbers coming on to currency
again it will take in the currency
symbol based on the Locale that you have
selected the geographic location and in
terms of custom then you can provide a
custom unit you can provide a custom uh
currency option in case uh how do you
want these separators whether you want
to have uh commerce between every
thousands or every hundreds so that's
how you can again select it at a
customized level
scientific is the numbers will be
displayed in a scientific notion that is
the decimals uh where do you want to
place your decimal values all right
percentage as the name provider is going
to show you the numbers in a percentage
format and custom is where you want to
provide and type in a format completely
using a special
all right so that's where you can
completely format and you can specify
based on the number coding or The
Styling that you want
so moving further
so what is data so your filter helps you
in narrowing down your data it can be
applied to a dimension that is your
contextual value to measures which is
your numerical value over to a date
field as well where you want to narrow
it down to a specific value or a range
of values all right in Tableau so what
are the ways that you can uh possibly
filter now what are the different
conditions that you can possibly filter
is one you can select the data to filter
in the view so right you can add it up
to the filter shell directly and choose
whether you want to include or exclude
the option the other way is you can have
it added up to the filter shelf as well
or you can turn on the quick filters
which opens up a new card where you can
quickly add in or alter your data in
terms of
you to the
you can use resource and how we can
manipulate our data in terms of
narrowing it down all right so let us
start beginning with the very first one
and I'm moving on to the interface here
all right
now first I'm going to show you how we
can filter on the dimensions okay so let
me take in a new sheet all right and
let's say I'm going to have the customer
name filter so I'm going to use my
customer name Dimension and add it up to
the filter shares here this opens up the
filter window all right and in this
particular window uh you have four tabs
as you can see one thing the general one
being wildcard one being condition and
top now let me first explain each of
these steps and then we'll proceed
further in understanding how we can
filter on the dimension here all right
so in the general option you can select
the list that you want in terms of
filtering and whether you want to
include it or you want to exclude that
particular selection all right so in
clicking on exclude will exclude
whatever selections you've made
unchecking this option by default needs
whatever we selected I need to only
include those customer names onto my
view all right the next is you can have
a custom value list or you can also have
a use all feature when I'm saying I want
to use all the options and I want to
include these so that is the first
general option the second option is in
terms of okay having a boy card so a
wire card is where you can specify a
particular match value whether you want
to that value contains that particular
alphabet or starts with that alphabet
ends with that alphabet or exactly
matches that alphabet so let's say let's
use the Y card option and say I want the
names starting with all right the
alphabet let me choose the alphabet s
all right so I'm saying that all my
customer names should start with the
alphabet s so when I click on this and
then I use the customer name onto my
view I will only be viewing customers
with the name starting with s all right
so uh conditions is where you can apply
a condition based on a particular field
or by a formula and top is where we can
apply the field to be the top 10
customers based on a particular uh
Dimension or a measure or by a
particular formula so we'll understand
these tabs with different options of
filtering let's use the wild card
all right now in terms of the wildcard
option so we've mentioned it starts with
or the letter S and I click on OK
foreign
so you can see that we only will have
the names beginning with s it's filtered
down because we said that we need the
name starting with s and we have all the
customers our name starting with an s
here let's add sales to our columns and
we have all the names of the customers
beginning with s that's how you can
filter on a particular Dimension right
in terms of the RC car has put up a
question in terms of uh can we explain
the custom value list in terms of the
capital values we got what happens is
let me just open up the filter here so
that I can explain that to you quickly
when you talk of Select list you can
select from the particular option that
you want all right and in terms of a
custom value now let's say you want to
randomly have uh different names one
beginning with a now this is a huge long
list all right so in terms of a custom
value I can simply enter the names or
keep adding in the names that I already
know so let's see if I take in an Al is
there an allen in our name or let's say
we already know there's a Sally in our
name so do we have a Sally I'm going to
say add the name Sally up add the name
sanjita so I can use a custom list
because I already know the listen sort
of uh avoiding the pain of scrolling
through this huge list I know my values
I'm going to Simply add and enter the
text and keep adding it so that's a
custom value list
I'm going to cancel the option because I
want to right now uh stick on to
customer's name beginning with s all
right so that was an example where we
get finished off on a field all right
where I can filter on a dimension field
in terms of case sensitive yes we have
to check on that because in most cases
Tableau is usually very case sensitive
when it comes to name so let's say we
already know that uh we have a Sally in
our list let us check if I have Sally
added in as so then in that case you can
see it's giving me a drop down option to
select from in terms of the case
sensitivity and then all the possible
names that are available for Sally it's
giving me the options to choose from
so that was uh filtering on a dimension
now let me show you how you can filter
on the
measure all right so before that let me
show you one new Option and using the
conditions tab okay so from the Wi-Fi
let me take a new sheet this time and uh
let's have a condition specified or in
terms of the filter so this time again
let's have our customer names added into
the filter
in the condition now this is where you
can specify whether you want it by field
or how do you want to select it whether
you want to use a particular card
whether you want to specify a particular
condition now before I move in here to
the conditions there is one important
thing that I need to perform that's your
your there is no y card that's been used
all right but let's say if it was the
same filter on the previous one then you
will need to go back to the Y card
option and clear and uncheck the option
because it will not then be able to take
in all these tabs and detailing so here
are creating a new sheet hence no worry
but if we do it in the previous sheet it
says where we have the Wi-Fi then it's
going to consider that it needs to be
beginning with this as well as these
conditions but only if you want the
conditions to be applied then you need
to clear the Wild Card all right
so the wires are drawn and let's say I
want to know the field and in terms of I
want to know the customer name wherein
my sales all right is uh let's keep the
aggregation now these are the
aggregations that you can choose from
let's keep it default at some and my and
my sales should be greater than
10 000 all right
let's click on okay now you can also
provide a minimum and a maximum range
value or you can then apply a particular
formula so you can apply your condition
click on OK and now when we add in the
customer name now you can drag and drop
it in the fields as well specified here
and now we get to see only those
customers which are having the sales as
we specified which is about 10 000 let's
add sales and we'll be able to see let's
enable our data labels all the sale
values are about 10 000 for these
customers all right
so you can add in a condition similarly
we can also change these and apply so
now I'm going to this time go to the
conditions Tab and I'm going to click on
the none option because we're now going
to have the top customers by field where
we now want to filter our data based on
our top customers all right so let's
keep it to default you have the option
of you want to see the top customers or
the bottom customers how many by numbers
10 or a particular parameter those
parameters is where we will be
discussing when we proceed ahead and
discuss the parameters topic
foreign
so yes you will be able to filter on the
dimensions and measures as well so you
can have the top 10 uh customer names
based on my sales job all right or let's
say you can have it on the on the basis
of profit also you can change it to
profit this time you're using a lot of
sales and let me click on OK all right
so now what happened is notice in our
view we're able to see the customer name
the sales by each of these customers
that have been generated for the top 10
customers giving us the top 10 profits
so although profit is not in my view
these are my top 10 customers based on
profit all right and what is the sales
generated by each of these top 10
customers and who these top 10 customers
are all right so that's another way that
we could use is the top tab option in
the filter when we are filtering on a
particular Dimension all right now
there's another way that you can fill it
off you can click on a particular option
and keep only or excluded so that is one
way way of filtering right onto your
data the other one as we saw was
filtering adding it up to the filter
shell all right dried in the drop down
it also shows quick filter so when you
click on the quick filter option here it
gives you a special mascot that opens up
where you can quickly keep analyzing
instead of going and editing the option
it gives you the general option where
you can keep analyzing a particular
customer name that you want to see and
these are limited by the top 10 all
right
so that's your quick filter option you
can remove it you can apply it to the
sheet you can even customize you can uh
display how you want it to be viewed in
terms of the filter option that is
displayed whether you want it at a
multiple list or slider or drop down a
multiple value drop down a custom list
or a by card match all right and based
on that then you can also mention
whether you want to include these values
or exclude these values and finally you
can hide the cards as well all right
so that was your uh quick filter now you
can also as I mentioned Frito on
Dimensions so let me add in a new sheet
here and show you how you can filter on
your measures now so uh this time let's
have our customer names on two rows all
right let's have sales onto uh the
filter shares this time so we're going
to be filtering now this time if you
notice the filter shell because it's a
measure it opens up as to how you want
to filter what is the aggregation that
you want to use whether you want to use
all the values whether you want to use
the particular aggregation or some
additional uh analysis in terms of
deviation of variance all right I'm
going to stick to the sum the basic one
and click on next this opens up the
option now whether you want to filter
based on the range of values all right
whether you want to filter based on the
uh least values all right so these are
the different options let me explain
each of these options as well to yours
so in the range of values you can
specify
you know range as minimum and maximum
that you want to explore so you can use
the uh slider your as well and specify
let's say we want a value of
approximately 5000 and narrow down this
particular data all right from 5000 now
you can see at times when you just want
to use an approximate value then it's
fair enough to use these sliders or
another way of doing it in a simpler
manner would be you can simply type in
the details right so you want it at ten
thousand and five thousand so you can
also use the slider or use the
particular Titan box where you can type
in the range of values next you have at
least now this includes all the values
which are greater than or equal to the
specified minimum value so it needs to
be greater than or equal to 5000 is what
we are specifying so any value that we
add in our state value should be above
5000 that is at least and at most is
obviously then the opposite that we are
mentioning it should include all the
values that are less than or equal to
this maximum value that we're specifying
so if you're saying it should not be
above 5000 they are only wanting this to
see the sales of 5000 and below so
that's the minimum and maximum value of
at least and at most and in terms of
special this is to do with handling your
filter your null values in in your view
so this is a filter that helps you
narrow down on the null values whether
you want to include the null values
whether you want to have the non-null
values or you want all the values valid
up in your view all right so based on
that you can have your selections and
finally click on OK all right so uh let
me click on
the Range you are in this case and you
can select on a range as I mentioned you
can click uh and have the option of
let's say 5000 on to 15
000 and click on OK so now you're going
to be able to see your sales which is
going to be in the range of 5000 until
16 000 only
all right
similarly you can also filter on dates
now when it comes to date as well the
filter window opens up in a different
fashion so we saw in Dimensions it opens
up in terms of four tabs in terms of the
measure it opens up the aggregation we
want to use and then this values that we
want to specify now when it comes to
filtering on dates then in this case
what happens is that Tableau opens up a
different kind of window when you're
wanting to filter on dates so let's uh
have a look at that as well
so let me open up the filter dates
option for you all
so let's have the order date added in
onto my filter here so this opens up
this filter window wherein it is
specified uh the page here or date field
and Tableau is created your special Nano
or special dimensional it uh often
handles it in a different way as you saw
even when it comes to hierarchies it
automatically creates a hierarchy for
you in terms of dates so even with
filters it handles it in a different
manner here it specifies one whether you
want to use these relative date filter
or the range of dates now when you use
the first option which is the relevant
uh relative dates Builders then here
you're going to be defining a range of
dates that is going to get updated based
on the date and time that you open the
view all right so it's more like
whatever view you select let's say you
want to see the year to their sales uh
for the records of the last 30 days all
right so in that case you can actually
specify selecting on the relative dates
and uh that's where you can mention the
detailing up I want to see today's date
and the last 30 days of whatever is
today's date so that's how to use in the
relative dates the next option that you
have in terms of the range of dates is
where you can provide
the range of a particular date where you
can given uh the kind of date that you
want to choose all right so in terms of
range of dates you will be specifying a
particular range and once you've decided
and selected between these two options
then you need to select on whether which
kind of a filter that on the drilling
that you have whether you want to do it
on your on the quarter or on the month
all right so that's how you can specify
that particular date and get us uh let
me click on the relative days option
here and click on next so when we open
the relative dates then in this case you
can see again it's giving us special
four tabs here so the relative date in
this case is we can specify uh let's say
the sales in the last couple of days so
we can specify whether we want to see
the sales yesterday and last how many
number of days today with the next how
many days or you want to see the days
the sales for tomorrow similarly then
you have range of date so you can
specify a particular range all right
whether let's say you have the data
you're coming in from first of April
2014 going up to 31st December you can
make use of the calendar and choose your
specific date range you can also use the
slider you have to specify the starting
date again it's more like the minimum
and maximum so starting is all the days
starting from this date and above and
ending is that we want to have and see
our data wherein the ending date should
be 31st of December and sales achieved
until this specific date nothing beyond
that particular in case even if it's
present any data present about 2014 31st
December we're still limiting it that it
should be until 31st of December and
then the special tab which again gives
us the flexibility in terms of filtering
whether there are null dates non-nail
dates or you want all the dates to be
included all right the option we have in
terms of filtering all are dates all
right so as you saw we can filter right
in the view where I mentioned you can
have the exclude or include option you
can drag a particular field right into
the filter shell you can also turn on
the quick filter and make use of it so
that is the filter shelf we saw
depending on the size we can filter on a
dimension or we can filter on or measure
or or date as well for complex
analytical projects organizing and
simplifying data is one of the crucial
tasks it is important to be able to
simplify data for proper analysis
organizing and simplifying data is a
critical part of Tableau mission to
facilitate you to see and understand
data
Tableau can help you with all stages of
an analytics project by using these
Advanced capabilities
in this lesson we will discuss Advanced
capabilities to complete sophisticated
analytics projects after completing this
lesson you will be able to
perform filtering and sorting on data
create combined fields to merge data
from different dimensions
create groups and Define aliases
create and work with sets and combined
sets drill to other levels of data in
your hierarchies
add Grant totals and subtotals in a view
change aggregation functions for a
measure
split a measure value into bins the
first topic that you will study in this
lesson is filtering data
Jenny the sales manager of a chain of
departmental stores is planning to
launch a new branding policy for a line
of furniture that sells well
for this she needs to analyze the
subcategories under furniture with sales
over thirty thousand dollars in the year
2013. to discuss the matter she calls
one of the sales executive Alex
hi Alex we are in the process of
launching a new branding policy for a
line of furniture with good sale but to
decide on the categories I need to
analyze which furniture sales crossed
over thirty thousand dollars in 2013.
can you recommend a way to complete this
task
sure Jenny I think what you need is a
bar chart where you can filter the
results as per your analysis
that's right how can we do this in the
most efficient manner
we can use Tableau application that
provides a number of features to create
bar charts and filter large amounts of
data as per your desired analysis
great you can start working on this task
and present the analysis to me when
you're done
so before we proceed further let's
discuss what is a filter
yes you guessed it filters let you
filter data a filter is a condition
which can be applied to Dimensions
measures or date fields to narrow down
the data displayed in a view
in Tableau they can be either static or
interactive being able to filter data is
essential to any analysis with Tableau
Data can be filtered in different ways
you can apply filter using one of these
methods
select data to filter in the view drag
fields to the filter shelf activate
quick filters
when you select data to filter in the
view the filtered fields are added to
the filters shelf and The Unwanted
fields are removed
when you drag fields to the filter's
shelf a filter dialog box opens when you
activate quick filters the filter dialog
box opens as a new card where data can
be quickly added and altered so how can
the dimensions be filtered
Dimensions can be filtered either on the
filter shelf or in the quick filter when
you drag the dimension to the filter
shelf a filter window will appear
these are the key tabs of the filter
window so how do these tabs function let
me explain each tab one by one the first
tab is the general tab which helps you
select the list of elements you want to
include in the filter
you can use one of the following options
to define the element list
select from list this option allows you
to select the elements you want to
include from the list
next is the custom value list in this
option you can use the search box to
directly locate the elements and the
last one is the use all option that
allows you to include all the elements
in the filter
now you understand how General tab
functions yes I do great let's move to
the next tab the wild card in the
wildcard tab you can match the names of
elements by selecting one of the
following options contains starts with
ends with exactly matches
next you have the condition tab with the
help of this tab you can specify a
filter condition in this only the
elements that satisfy the condition will
be included in the view
to define a condition you can use the
none by field and by formula options
these tabs allow you to perform a lot of
functions what about the last tab in the
top tab you can specify a condition to
include the top n or bottom n elements
to define a condition you can use the
none by field by formula options thanks
Alex Tableau really has some amazing
capabilities let me now explain how you
can apply filter on measures before you
begin with that Alex I have a quick
question does Tableau allow me to filter
on a measure where an I can select to
either filter row level data or an
aggregated value of data indeed it does
Tableau allows you to filter at row
level data in which measure value is
calculated individually for every Row in
the data set no aggregation functions
are used for row level calculations
while in summary level calculation
measure value is calculated using an
aggregation function on the row level
data aggregation functions are used for
summary level calculations
in Tableau the data is automatically
aggregated by performing summation when
a measure is placed on a shelf when you
apply filter on a measure it allows you
to filter row level data select all
values to filter summary level data
select one of the available aggregation
functions date filters are extremely
common date fields are a special kind of
Dimension that Tableau often handles
differently than standard categorical
data so far we have learned how to
perform filtering and sorting on data
Greg is planning to launch a new
branding policy for a line of furniture
that sells well this demonstration will
help you understand how Greg analyzes
the subcategories by creating bar charts
and applying appropriate filter to it
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a horizontal bar chart with
subcategory Dimension and sales measure
drag the category Dimension to the
filter Shelf
filter only for the furniture category
drag the order date Dimension to the
filters Shelf
select filter field as years to filter
only for 2013.
drag the sales measure to the filter's
Shelf
filter for subcategories with sum of
sales greater than thirty thousand
dollars
observe the change in bar chart after
applying filters
rename the sheet as filtering data
save the workbook as furniture
subcategories with sales more than
thirty thousand dollars in 2013.
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
filtering data
the quick filter can get started for
existing filters as well as for
non-filtered fields
the filter dialog box includes these
filter modes single values list single
value drop down single values slider
multiple values list multiple values
drop down multiple values slider
wildcard match the data can be selected
from the given list as well as can be
searched using the search icon present
in the title area of the quick filter
with the quick filter option you can
quickly add and modify filters you just
need to follow three simple steps
firstly activate a quick filter on the
region Dimension notice a smaller
representation of the filter dialog box
opens as a new card quickly select what
to include in The View
and you are done now let us move to the
second topic sorting of data
sorting data is an integral part of data
analysis sorted data is easier to
analyze sorting a data view refers to a
range in dimension members in a
specified order you might want to put a
list of names in alphabetical order
compile a list from highest to lowest or
order rows by colors or icons
sorting data helps you quickly visualize
and understand your data better organize
and find the data that you want and
ultimately enables you to make more
effective decisions in Tableau you can
sort data in numerous ways sorting can
be performed on axis specific fields and
manually
Tableau supports computed sorting and
manual sorting
computed sorting uses programmatic rules
to sort the view such as sorting
alphabetically or from lowest to highest
manual sorting enables you to reorganize
the order of dimension in the table and
can only be implemented on distinct
Fields with a distinct measure now that
you know that the data can be sorted in
different ways let's discuss each of
these in detail sure I would like to
know more about it to sort on axis you
can single click the sort icon on the
measure axis to sort the bars in
descending order or double-click the
sort icon on the measure axis to sort
the bars in ascending order
the data can be automatically sorted
using the sort button on the axis to
give a better view of data to sort on a
specific field use the sort menu option
to sort by one or more fields in a
specified order then select the data
source order option to sort data in the
order of the data source
the sort dialog box includes these
criteria sort order displays the output
in ascending or descending order
sort by sort either by data source order
alphabetic or by fields to perform a
manual sort use the sort menu option to
sort manually
then rearrange the order of Dimension
members in a custom order based on your
business specifications
manual sort can be done in two ways use
sort toolbar button on the selected item
locate and drag headers in the view let
us now move to the next topic creating
combined fields
combined fields are used to create a
cross product of members from different
dimensions
two or more Dimensions can be combined
to create a Cartesian product of
Dimension members
The View includes all combinations of
each member of the dimensions let's look
at an example a combined field has been
created using segment and region when
added to the view it displays all
combinations of segment and region
elements creating groups and defining
aliases are some more features that
Tableau offers let's understand each of
these Concepts let's say you want to
view data at levels that are not already
present in the data source in such
situations groups are used to combine
Dimension members to create a higher
level member
when a group is created a default name
is automatically formed using the
combined member's name the new grouped
field takes over the dimension on rows
or columns
for example a group can be created by
combining the sales for envelopes labels
and paper for analysis now the question
arises that can alternate names be
provided in this case and the answer is
yes you can aliases will provide the
flexibility for renaming Dimension
members to help make more sense in the
current view the good part is Tableau
does not change the original data on
changing an alias in your view you can
change aliases at any time using the
edit aliases dialog box
there are some things you need to keep
in mind such as aliases can only be
defined for discrete dimensions and
dates these can be applied to Dimensions
only and not to measures moreover the
method for creating aliases depends on
the type of data source you use
following is an illustration of defining
an alias for the East element of the
reason dimension
let us now move to the next topic
working with sets and combined sets
usually you have large sets of data that
you want to visualize in such a
condition you might find that limiting
the amount of information displayed to
an important subset of Records helps you
work with and answer questions about the
data more effectively
sets are custom fields that Define a
subset of Dimension members a set can be
created for specific Dimension members
in the view or it can be based on a
condition
computed sets are dynamic as the number
of members in the set can vary at
runtime based on the condition
furthermore you can also drag a set to
the filter shelf to quickly filter the
view to display only the members of the
sets likewise you can also create a set
by combining existing sets all you need
is to specify The Logical operator
between the two sets new sets can be
formed by combining the sets consisting
of either all the members from the sets
only shared members members existing in
one of the sets the dimensions of the
sets should be the same in order to
combine two sets by now you have a brief
idea on how to create groups Define
eliases and create sets and combine sets
Greg is planning to launch an
advertising scheme for certain product
subcategories that are related to each
other this demonstration shows how Greg
creates a visualization that displays
the aggregated profit ratio and
highlights the bottom five subcategories
by sales
this demo will give you an overview on
how to create a group to combine
Dimension members
create a computed set to include
Dimension members automatically
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a horizontal bar chart with
subcategory Dimension and profit ratio
measure
select tables and chairs to create a
group
create a set on subcategory
name the set as bottom five
subcategories by sales
click the top tab
under by field select bottom five
subcategories by sales from the drop
down
drag the bottom five subcategories by
sales set to the color shelf to the
marks card
rename the sheet as groups and sets
save the workbook as working with groups
and sets
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
working with groups and sets
now let us study how can we drill to
other levels in a hierarchy
Jenny is required to present the
company's sales performance across
different regions states and cities in
an upcoming meeting she calls Alex to
help her make this report in a quick and
efficient manner
hi Alex I need you to create a report
for me to present the company's sales
performance across different regions
states and cities
sure Jenny are there any specific points
that you want me to keep in mind yes I
want to use the same data source for the
detail and summary information in other
words I want to create a report where
all the data is contained within the
same report
can you suggest a way to do that
sure Jenny for creating such reports
Tableau offers the feature of hierarchy
where you can drill down to several
lower layers of detail
great please start working on this
report and share the final output with
me
I was just wondering can we drill to
other levels in a hierarchy yes we can a
hierarchy is a grouping of related
Dimensions depicting direct parent-child
relationships between them built-in
hierarchies are not present in
relational databases but it can be
inherited from the relational databases
that have similar dimensions
it is useful in the following ways it
facilitates analyzing a high level
overview of your data and then drilling
down to lower levels of detail what's
amazing in that Tableau separates the
data fields automatically into
hierarchies so you can easily Break Down
The View by year quarter month Etc
moreover it also enables you to create
your own custom hierarchies if you want
to view your data at a lower or higher
level in the hierarchy then drilling is
what you're looking for for instance you
can drill up from date through year or
you can drill down from year to date
that way drilling is one of the most
suitable ways to navigate hierarchies
various methods of drilling are
available in Tableau it allows you to
drill using fields on shelves or drill
using headers let me show you how
drilling using headers can be referred
to as uneven drill as only desired
members are displayed rather than all
the members from the list you can click
a header value in the view and select
drill down or drill up from the menu
let's say it is drilled down from year
level to quarter level you can expand or
collapse a dimension in the rows or
columns shelf to drill down or up
respectively the plus and minus signs on
the fields that are placed on the
shelves shows the drill status so that
means the plus sign indicates that it
can be drilled down further while the
minus sign indicates that you can drill
up but cannot drill down further Greg is
required to present the company's sales
performance across different regions
states and cities he is required to
create a report such that all the data
is contained within the same report
let's see how he does that
open Tableau 9.0
from the home page connect to the saved
sample Superstore data set
create a hierarchy by dragging State
onto region
name the hierarchy as geography
in the geography hierarchy drag City
below state
create a report with region and sales
right-click West select keep only
drill down from region to state
right-click California Select keep only
drill down from state to City
rename the sheet as sales analysis
save the workbook as company sales
performance
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
drill down report
now let us discuss another important
feature of Tableau Grand totals and
subtotals totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute Grant totals and subtotals for
the data in a view these totals can be
applied only on grid type visualizations
Tableau does not compute subtotals and
Grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and Grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute Grand totals and subtotals for
the data in a view
these totals can be applied only on grid
type visualizations
Tableau does not compute subtotals and
Grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and Grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity Tableau computes subtotals
and Grand totals as the original measure
at a higher level of aggregation let us
proceed with understanding how to define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices Tableau allows you to Define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices such as summation and variance
you can change the aggregation function
by right-clicking a dimension in either
the rows or columns shelf or by
right-clicking a field in the data pane
here we have changed the aggregation
function to average next we are going to
study about Tableau bins which are
useful to create a range of data bins
are custom bandings of the values of a
measure based on a specific size you can
bin data only for relational data
sources it does not support this feature
for multi-dimensional data sources
bins can be referred to as buckets of
values and can be created for numeric
Dimensions there are two types that you
can create fixed sized and variable
sized you can create a fixed sized bin
by specifying the size of each bin in
the create bins window
keep in mind that by default Tableau
creates even-sized bins based on a size
you specify
as you can see I have created fixed
sized bins on the discount measure of
size 10 each to create a variable size
bin create a calculated field with an
appropriate script you will learn about
calculated fields in detail in lesson 8
calculations
for now just remember that you need to
create a calculated field to create bins
of variable size
look we have three pins on the discount
measure of variable sizes now that
you've gone through the need and
importance of organizing and simplifying
data let us have a quick look at the key
takeaways filters enable you to narrow
down the data displayed in a view
sorting refers to the arrangement of
Dimension members in a specified order
combined fields are used to create a
cross product of members from different
dimensions a group is a combination of
Dimension members that make up a higher
level category
aliases are alternate names for specific
values within a dimension
sets are custom fields that Define a
subset of data based on some conditions
drilling helps you analyze the data in a
view at a lower or higher level in the
hierarchy
bins are custom bandings of measure
values they can be created either as
fixed sized or variable sized
time for some Hands-On practice let's
Now understand the below scenario and
work on it together
you are an owner of a store and want to
analyze the existing discount strategy
offered by your store
you wish to view the number of customers
who have been offered discounts between
0 and 10 percent 10 and 20 percent and
so on
create a histogram with discount bins
and count of discounts and answer the
following questions
how many customers were given discounts
between 0 and 10 percent
what is the total sale recorded when
customers were offered a discount
between 20 and 30 percent
now wasn't that a great experience you
will be happy to know that we have two
more similar scenarios for you to
strengthen your understanding of
organizing and simplifying data
read the scenarios carefully and perform
the task on the Tabo 9 tool downloaded

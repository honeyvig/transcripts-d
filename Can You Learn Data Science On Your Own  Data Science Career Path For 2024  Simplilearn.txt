can you learn data science by yourself
absolutely learning data science on your
own is definitely possible first let's
understand what data science is data
science is an interdisciplinary field
that uses scientific methods processes
algorithms and system to extract
knowledge and insights from structured
and unstructured data it compiles
multiple Fields including stat computer
science mathematics and domain expertise
to understand complex problem s and make
data Ren decisions so now let's take a
fictional example in the retail industry
imagine you are a data scientist working
for a large retail chain and your goal
is to increase sales in the coming
quarter your company has collected vast
amount of data including customer
purchase history website click stream
data or social media activity and many
other so your task is to analyze this
data to identify Trends and patterns
that can help to improve sales right so
so some steps you might take will be
data collection data cleaning and
preparation Eda explor data analysis or
feature engineering model selection and
training evaluation and testing and many
other steps so this example illustrates
the steps involved in a data science
project in an industry setting so I want
to say that you can learn coding data
analysis data visualization by yourself
but data science is not all about this
you should know storytelling finding
patterns and finding insights from the
particular data so if you will ask why
storytelling so well let's put it in
this way in today's data driven world
it's not just about the numbers to truly
stand out as a data scientist you need
to be able to VI a compelling narrative

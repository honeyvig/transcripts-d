hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
learn the fundamentals of c-sharp
programming language but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies so if
you're a tech geek in a continuous hunt
for latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now let's get started
with the agenda for today's session
first we will learn the history of c
sharp programming language later we will
go through a brief introduction of c
sharp next we will understand the
variables data types and operators in c
programming language followed by that we
will try to understand the structure of
a c programming language
once we are done with the fundamentals
we will try to execute the first c sharp
programming language later we will try
to install the best id for c-sharp that
is the visual studio in the windows
operating system and try to run a
program in it
followed by that we will understand the
conditional statements in c-sharp next
we will look into the arrays strings and
c sharp then we will understand the
functions in c sharp later we will get
into the collections in c sharp
programming language followed by that we
have enum in c sharp next we will
understand the object oriented
programming paradigms of c sharp then we
will learn the access modifiers
used in c sharp next we have the file
operations exception handling and last
but not the least we will wind up the
session by learning the new features in
c sharp
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with the
first point in our agenda for today's
session
so the first topic history of c sharp c
is a microsoft provided object-oriented
programming language that runs on a
framework for internet and anders
eilsberg was the first person to create
it
after learning how the c programming
language was created we will look at the
introduction of c programming language
where it is used and why we should use
it
so c sharp is a microsoft provided
object oriented language that runs on
the dotnet framework
c has its roots in the c family and is
related to other popular programming
languages like java and c plus plus
in the year 2002 the first version was
released c-sharp version 8 is the most
recent version which was released in
september of the year 2019.
sesia programming language is used in
various fields including mobile
applications desktop applications web
applications web services websites games
database applications and virtual
reality now we will look at why we
should use c-sharp programming language
c sharp is one of the most widely used
programming languages in the world it is
simple to learn and use and it has lot
of community support
c sharp is an object-oriented
programming language that gives programs
a clean structure and reuses code
lowering development costs
because c sharp is like c c plus plus
and java it is simple for the
programmers to switch to c sharp or vice
versa
moving ahead with the fundamentals of c
sharp we will now look into the data
types in c sharp data types can be
classified based on the memory location
the first data type in sesha programming
language is value types followed by that
we have the reference data types and
finally we have the pointer data types
we will go through all these three types
in detail first we will look at the
value data types in c sharp a data type
is a value type if it can be stored as
values in its own memory space
that means this type of data types
directly store their data or value in a
variable for example you can see on my
screen we have integer variable i is
storing the value 200 so these type of
data types are called as value data
types
so a few examples of value data types
are boolean byte character decimal
double enum float integer long short and
structure
next we will see the reference data
types in c sharp so a reference data
type unlike a value type does not store
its value directly instead it saves the
address where the value is kept in other
words a reference type contains a
pointer to another memory location where
the data is stored an example of
reference data type is string anime is
equal to simply learn where the string
is reference data type
the following data types are a few
examples for reference types that is
strings arrays class and delegate
last we have the pointed data type in c
programming language
a simplest data type is the pointed data
type its functionality is identical to
that of a pointer in c programming
language and it is intended to store the
address of another pointer an example of
pointer which is shown on my screen is
int pointer p
we will look at the variables in c sharp
after we understood the data types in c
sharp
variables are storage containers of data
values in c sharp there are various
types of variables defined with
different keywords such as first the
integer data type or integers that store
values such as 1 2 3 or minus 1 2 3.
next data type is the double which
stores floating point numbers with
decimal places such as 19.99 or minus
19.99
followed by that we have the character
data type which stores single characters
such as a or b
to surround character values single
quotes are used
the next data type is the string data
type the stringed data type stores
string values such as hello world double
quotes are used to surround the string
values finally there is boolean type
data type which stores values such as
true or false now we will look at how to
declare variables in c sharp programming
language
to make variable you must first specify
its type and assign its value the syntax
for declaring variables is as follows we
have the data type which is data types
here in this case we are using integer
then we have a variable name in my case
we are having a variable with name that
is name one and the value we are storing
inside is x y z
so this is how exactly you try to
declare variables in c sharp programming
language
so followed by the variables in c
programming language we will learn about
the operators in c sharp programming
language operators are used to
manipulate variables and values there
are four types of operators in c
programming language the first one is
the automatic operators next we have the
assignment operators followed by that we
have the comparison operators and lastly
we have the logical operators
we will go through each one of these in
detail beginning with the automatic
operators
first we have the additional automatic
operator which adds values together then
there is subtraction operator takes one
value and subtracts it from another
following that we have the
multiplication operator which multiplies
two values following that we have the
division operator which divides one
value with another
next we have the modulus operator which
returns a reminder of the division
following that we have the increment and
decrement operators where increment
increases the value by 1 and decrement
decreases the value by 1. next we have
the assignment operators in the list
variables are assigned with values using
the assignment operators following are
some of the assignment operators to use
in c sharp
first we have equal to operator then we
have not equal to operator later we have
greater than next we have less than
following to the assignment operators we
have greater than or equal to finally we
have less than or equal to operators
last but not the least we have logical
operators which is used to explain
operators in c programming language to
determine logic between variables or
values logical operators are being used
the first logical operator in c sharp
programming languages and operator
and operator provides a result as true
if only both the values are true if one
of them is false then it returns false
next after and operator we have or
operator it returns a true value if
either of the values is true if both the
values are false then the result will be
false
finally we have not logical operator not
basically is the negation of whatever
the number you provide to it if you
provide a true value it gives you a
false value and if you provide a false
value it returns a true value now that
we know the fundamentals in c
programming language that is the data
types variables and operators we will
now look into the basic structure of a c
programming language
so the basic structure of a c
programming language looks something
like this
so basic structure of a seisha
programming language includes a class so
in here we have a class named by simply
learn you can also have a class name
based on your decision next we have the
main function followed by the class
later we have the void and static data
types and align string argument and
finally a print message now that we have
understood the basic structure of a c
programming language let us see the
first c sharp programming language so on
my screen you can see a basic c sharp
programming language that is used to
print a message hello first we'll use
the system namespace in c sharp and will
do so because we have namespaces that we
use to organize classes and the system
in a namespace using the system imports
the namespace and you can now access the
classes in the system namespace next as
the first program we have the class
keyword and class name and then we will
enter the main function and print the
message hello
now we will see how to write comments in
c programming language commands can be
used to explain and improve the
readability of c-sharp code it can also
be used to prevent the execution when
experimenting with the different codes
in c sharp there are two types of
commands the first one is the single
line command and single line commands
are
preceded by two forward slashes c-sharp
ignores any text between two forward
slashes and the end of the line does not
execute it you can see this is the
command as the command and this command
has been preceded by two forward slashes
this particular statement will be
ignored by c sharp followed by single
line command we have double line or
multi-line commands in c sharp so the
commands that span multiple lines begin
with forward slash star and end with
star forward slash can be considered as
multiline commands c sharp will ignore
any text between these type of commands
in this example you can see this is a
multi-line command and this statement
will print hello simply learn is a
command hidden between forward slash
star and star forward slash so this is a
multi-line command
with that we have finished the
multi-line command synthesia programming
language moving ahead we will try to
install the best id for c programming
language and the tutorial for that is
linked in the description box below
please feel free to check it out and
without further ado let's get started
with the next topic that is conditional
statements in c programming language
the programmer must specify one or more
conditions to be evaluated or tested by
the program a statement or statements to
be executed in the form of a condition
is determined to be true or optionally
or other statements to be executed if
the condition is determined to be false
the types of conditional statements in c
programming language are as follows in c
we start with if statement then we have
if else statement following that we have
an if else if ladder and a nested if
condition statement and finally a switch
statement we will go through all of
these conditional statements in c sharp
one after the other
we will begin with if condition
statement
in c sharp programming language an if
statement is defined as a programming
conditional statement that is if true
performs an operation or displays
information within the statement block
and the statement for if statement is as
follows
if the condition is true only then a
block of code will be executed the flow
diagram of if statement in the
conditional statements is as shown below
first we will begin at the start and
there is a condition if the condition is
true the following statement will be
executed next
we have if else condition statement
in c sharp the if else statement is used
to perform the operations based on a
specific condition if the condition is
true the operation specified and the
block is executed otherwise the else
plot is executed the syntax of if else
statement is as follows if the condition
is true the block of code is to be
executed as true otherwise if the
condition is false the block of code to
be executed as false the flow diagram of
fl statement illustrates as follows
next after the if else statement we have
the if else if ladder
in c sharp if else statement is used to
perform operations based on specific
condition if the condition is true the
operation specified in the if block or
executed or else the else block will be
executed the following is the syntax for
f else if statement or if else if ladder
if the condition 1 is true the if block
of code will be executed otherwise if
condition 1 is false and condition 2 is
true the else if block will be executed
and if both the conditions are false
then the else block will be executed the
flow diagram for flc statements is as
follows
the next type of condition statement
will look as the nested if statement in
c programming language a nested if
statement is defined as a conditional
programming statement that includes
another if statement inside the previous
if statement
the following is the syntax of nested if
statement if condition 1 is true the
first block of code will be executed if
condition 2 is true the second f of the
block will be executed and if both the
conditions are false then the else block
of statements will be executed the flow
diagram for the nested if statement is
as follows
finally there is switch condition
statement
in c sharp programming language the
switch is defined as programming
selection statement that checks for a
possible match to provided condition
against the available cases if none of
the cases match the control will run the
default statement of the block the
syntax of switch statement is as follows
first we have an expression after the
switch k word then we have the following
cases if a case
matches expression their code will be
executed if case b matches the
expression case b's code will be
executed and so on if none of the cases
match the expression then the default
block code will be executed here is a
flow diagram of switch conditional
statement that shows how it works in
detail so followed by the conditional
statements in c sharp we have the loops
in c sharp
in c sharp the loop control statement
performs a looping operation until the
given condition is met when the
condition is false the controls are
removed from the loop statements there
are three different types of loops in c
sharp programming language as listed
below the first loop is for loop next we
have while loop and lastly we have do
while loop
the syntax for for loop is as follows
three statements in parenthesis after
the keyword for
statement one is executed once before
the code block is executed statement two
specifies the condition under which the
code block will be executed
after code block has been executed
statement 3 is executed every time the
flow diagram for the for loop is as
shown below first we will begin then we
will initialize and then there is a
condition if the condition is true we
will increment our decrement accordingly
and if the condition is false we will
end the process following that we will
learn about the while loop while loop is
a repeat statement or group statements
if a given condition is true before
executing the loop body it checks the
condition the syntax for while loop is
simple because there is only one
condition which will be run until the
condition becomes false the flow diagram
for while loop is shown as below first
we will start the loop then if the
condition is true the statement will be
executed until the condition is false
now we have do while loop at the end
do while loop is an alternative to while
loop this loop will execute the code
block once before checking the condition
is true and then it will loop along with
the condition is true if the condition
is false then the loop will stop
the flow diagram for do while loop is as
follows
following that we will learn about
arrays in c sharp programming language
a fixed size sequential collection of
elements of the same data type are
stored in an array an array
stores a collection of data but it is
often more useful to think of an array
as a collection of variables of the same
type stored in continuous memory
locations instead of declaring
individual variables like array array 1
array 2 3 4 and 99 you declare one array
variable like array and use memory
locations array of 0 array of 1 until
array of 99 to represent individual
variables an index is used to ask
specific element in an array
here we have an array array 0 is the
first element and array 99 is the last
element of the array following that we
will look into how to declare an array
in c sharp in c sharp you can declare an
array using the following syntax we
start with data type then we have square
brackets where we specify the size of
the array and finally we have the array
name
an array example is shown in the screen
where data type is integer and the array
name is array next we will look into how
to initialize array declaring an array
does not cause the array to be
initialized in memory after the array
variable has been initialized you can
assign values to it the syntax is as
follows because the array is a reference
data type you must see the new keyword
to create an array instance in the
following example we have an array
called numbers with the data type end
which we initialize with the keyword new
we will understand strings in c sharp
after seeing arrays in c sharp
so the string in c sharp is a string
object with the value text the text is
internally stored as a sequential
read-only collection
of character objects because there is no
null terminating character in the end of
c-sharp string it can contain any number
of embedded null characters
the syntax of string is given below
where first we have a character string
followed by a string's name
as a b c
an example of string that is simply
learn there are string functions listed
below
first we have the clone function which
returns a string reference next we have
a compare function that compares two
specific strings after that we have a
concat function that joins two strings
and stores the results in the first
string following that we have that
contains
return the value of the specified string
after that we have a copy to which the
character from the specified position
the following equals function that
determines the two string objects we
have the same value lastly we have a
trim function that trims the string
following these c sharp basics we will
learn about c sharp methods or functions
in this tutorial
a method is a collection of statements
that work together to complete a task
every c sharp the program contains at
least one class with the main method to
use methods in c sharp we must perform
first to define the method and secondly
to call the method first we will define
the methods when you define a method you
are essentially declaring the elements
that make up its structure
the syntax for defining a method is as
follows
first we have an access specifier then
we have a return type then we have a
method name
lastly we have a parameter list and
finally we have the block of code in the
following example we have a specific
public access specifier and returns
types of int
we have a method with name find minimum
which finds out minimum number between
the variables a and b following that we
will learn how to call a method you can
call a method using the name of the
method the following examples
exemplifies it we have used the same
example in defining the method so in the
main function we have called the find
min function which is assigned to the
result variable and prints minimum value
following that we will understand the
collections in c sharp
collection classes are specialized data
storage and retrieval classes stack skus
lists and hash tables are all supported
by these classes the interfaces of most
collection classes are the same
collection classes serve various
functions such as dynamically allocating
memory to elements and accessing a list
of items via an index among others
these classes construct collections of
objects which serve as foundation for
all the data types in c sha the
following are some c sharp collection
classes
the system system.collection namespaces
most used classes are listed below to
learn more about them the link is in the
description box below
first we have arraylist classes it
represents an ordered collection of
objects that can be individually indexed
the next class is hash table it makes
use of key to gain access to the
elements in the collection following
that we have sorted list to access the
items in a list it employs both a key
and an index after that we have a stack
class it represents a collection of
objects arranged in a last and first
order order next we have queue classes
it represents a collection of objects
arranged in a first in first out order
last but not the least
bit array it represents a binary
representation array with values 1 and
0. after we understand collections in c
sharp we will see e-nums in c-sharp an
e-num is a type of class representing a
collection of constraints variables that
cannot be changed or read
use the enum keyword rather than class
or interface to create an enum and
separate the enum items with a comma in
the following example the name of enum
is direction and all four directions
which are east west north and south are
separated by comma we will now look into
the object-oriented programming in
seisha oh is an abbreviation for
object-oriented programming writing
procedures or methods that perform
operations on data is what procedural
programming is all about in contrast an
object-oriented programming is all about
creating objects that contain both data
and methods object-oriented programming
has several advantages over procedural
programming including the following
object-oriented programming is faster
and easier to implement object-oriented
programming gives the programs a clear
structure
object-oriented programming aids in
keeping c sharp code dry do not repeat
yourself and makes it easier to maintain
modify and debug object-oriented
programming allows for the creation of
fully reusable applications with less
code and shorter development time after
learning about oops we will learn about
the object oriented programming
paradigms in c programming language
first we must comprehend classes and
objects
in c sharp everything is associated with
classes and objects and their attributes
and methods a car for example is an
object in real life the car has
attributes like size color as well as
methods like start and stop the class
functions similarly to an object
function is a blueprint for creating
objects
the following is an example an object is
a car and its attributes are its size
and color and starting and stopping are
its methods
following that we will go through the
four fundamental object-oriented
programming concepts and oops in c-sharp
the first concept of oops is abstraction
followed by that we have encapsulation
inheritance and finally we have
polymorphism we will learn all these
four concepts in depth
first c sharp abstraction
abstraction processes hiding of internal
details and displaying only the main
functionality
next we have encapsulation encapsulation
in c sharp is a process of combining
data members and member functions into a
single unit after that we have c sharp
inheritance it is a process by which one
object automatically inherits all the
properties and behaviors of its parent
object and lastly polymorphism it is
defined as one name many forms
polymorphism allows a class to have
multiple implementations with same name
next we have access modifier so access
specifiers in c sharp in c sharp access
modifiers specify the scope of
accessibility
of a class member or a type of class
itself the first access specifier is
public indicating that the code is
accessible to all classes the following
access specifier is private meaning the
code can be only accessed within the
same class following that the protected
access specifier the code is accessible
within the same class or a class
inherited from that class finally there
is an internal access specifier which
means that the code is only accessible
within its assembly and cannot be
accessed from another assembly following
that we will learn about the file
operations in c sharp the file mode
enumerator defines various file opening
methods the following members of file
mode and numerations are described first
there is append function
text is appended to an end of an already
existing file the following functions is
the copy function which duplicates the
file the third function is the creation
function which is used to create or
replace a file following that we have
the delete function which deletes a file
the fifth function is the xs function
which determines whether or not a file
exists
following that we have read all text
function this function reads the file
contents after that we have replace
function it replaces one file's contents
with contents of another finally write
all text creates a file and writes its
contents into it so following the file
handling in c sharp we have the
exception handling in c sharp
exception handling is a phrase that
deals with handling errors and
exceptions that occur during runtime due
to coding errors or invalid user input
in c programming language we use four
keywords in exception handling we'll
start with try exception handling the
try statement lets you define a section
of code that will be checked for errors
as it runs the catch statement is used
for exception handling if an error
occurs in the try block it allows you to
define a block of code that will be
executed following that we have finally
exception handling the final statement
allows you to run code after the try
statement regardless of the outcome of
catch finally there is throw exception
handling you can define your error using
the throw statement finally in this
video we will learn about the new
features of c sharp programming language
so some of the important new features of
c programming language includes the
following interface methods by default
types of nullable references
enhancements to pattern matching
asynchronous streams making use of
declarations interpolated were banned
team string enhancement assignment of
null coalition local static functions
indices and their ranges types of
unmanaged construction in nested
expressions use the read-only member
stackable
now with that we have reached to the end

about any of the topics covered in this
video then please feel free to let us
know in the comment section below and
our team of experts will be happy to
resolve all your queries until next time

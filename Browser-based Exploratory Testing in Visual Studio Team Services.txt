my name is Charles sterling I'm a senior
program manager in the visual studio
team and I'm excited that at connect
we're releasing a browser-based
exploratory testing tool here at
Microsoft we've always had great test
case management tools inside a visual
studio team system today we're actually
extending that with an exploratory
testing tool so you can integrate that
in your development environment this
tool makes it easy for you to annotate
and validate the should the value that
you're shipping in your product backlog
items makes it very very easy for you to
file bugs it's simple to get started
it's simple to acquire it works in your
environments whether they are Mac Linux
or Windows and also works across your
devices again working with Android iPad
iPhone and Windows Phone it's resilient
so if you happen to crash your browser
in one of these instances while you're
doing the exploratory testing when you
bring it back up we're gonna remember
where you were and be able to let you
continue on from there
so what is in this brand new tool this
tool is going to let you capture notes
making sure that you're actually
delivering the value as you think it is
or actually just notes about what you
want to do going forward we make it easy
for you to capture screenshots and
annotate those screenshots now whether
or not you do the annotation in our tool
or your own tool is up to you as I
mentioned earlier it's very simple the
file bugs and these are fairly rich bugs
we actually collect information about
the environment in which the bug was
filed all of this had occurred in a
timeline so if you actually span
different pbis
well actually put that in a single time
list so you can actually see where that
occurred and as I mentioned it enables
you to actually test it across your
mobile device so I'd love to show this
to you as a demo we have got great test
tools for formal testing and test case
management if you haven't looked at them
please do but this is about exploratory
testing and making it integral to the
dress the development cycle I wanted to
show you how you access it to make it
very easy to acquire you can download
the exploratory testing tool from the
new marketplace so if you haven't taken
a look at it please do if for no other
reason just to get the new exploratory
testing
I said make it integral to your
development environment or a development
process what am I talking about you can
see I'm actually looking at my backlog
right here and I've actually working
with Cory Fowler we said that we're
going to add categories to that sample
and we've done that and I'll actually
want to go ahead and create a
exploratory test for it so I'm gonna go
ahead open up the parts of limited
sample and click on that exploratory
test tool and right off the bat it's
asking me which visual studio team
service should I be using so I type in
parts Unlimited I think I fumbled
finger.this so let's see if we can fix
this and right off the bat it knows
about my projects that I'm actually
working on and I've been doing this with
Cory Fowler so I'm gonna go ahead and
reference the quarry team now in looking
at it looks awesome the team's done an
amazing job but I can see that we've
actually got an issue with the price of
the red wheel so I'm gonna go ahead and
start that session and I'm going to
capture a picture of this red wheel and
I'm gonna go ahead and draw a pointer to
it and say something like real price
revealed price is you know if this was
actually you know private information I
could go ahead and block the you know
and and blur that information as well
and this is included in a time line so I
could capture multiple multiple images
and it's all part of that time line you
can see the time line is taking me
forward in time now I mentioned that I
can not only test my Windows environment
but I can test my devices so I'm going
to go ahead and file a bug for that
wheel and I'm gonna go ahead and take a
look at it in my device so I'm gonna do
both things
first thing is I see that my wheel is
here and I could probably go ahead and
add real text here please update wheel
price
and price needs updated and if I go back
and take a look at that backlog where I
was showing you that work
I would actually find this bug as part
of part of my current sprint go ahead
and save that and it's just that easy
now let's take a look at this exact same
experience but on a physical device
working with our friends at perfecto
mobile working with our friends at
perfecto we make it very very easy for
you the developer to take a look at your
application running on physical devices
so I've entered in the credentials
letting me look at the perfecto mobile
cloud and you can see that I actually
have a bunch of different devices in the
cloud that is available to me I'm gonna
go ahead and enter in my iPad and the
iPad air 2 is what Corey is playing with
so let's go ahead and take a look at
make sure that we render okay on that
device now right off the bat you can see
that while we started our exploratory
instance and tab 1 or the the tab to our
immediate left of this one we are
actually going to maintain that state
and run it and know what was happening
before in that same time line in the
second tab that's pretty cool so I can
actually span instances and span tabs
inside of my browser let's go ahead and
start my Safari on this air pad - with
oh and it actually remembered from the
last time I was looking at this that it
remember this page so it looks pretty
good I could see right off the bat I do
have an issue with the logo it occurs in
both places but I do need to file this
as a bug as well so let's go ahead and
bring up the exploratory testing session
and take an image of the logo and I want
to make sure and include the device
crumbs that way the people who are
looking at it know that I was actually
in a device while I was capturing this
particular bug ooh yes the metadata will
be in the bug itself but that will
ability have a visual cue of that in the
picture itself and as I mentioned I did
the annotation earlier in our tool I
don't have to do that so I could go
ahead and not do the annotation here
file that bug copy this out
let's see if we can actually highlight
that good and like I said I'm kind of
old school so I'm gonna go ahead and
paste it into my paintbrush so we're
going to go ahead and copy image go into
paintbrush and I want the new logo we we
have a new logo
I actually I think I'm in charge of
updating it so we're going to go ahead
and update logo okay putting all of that
back on the clipboard we're going to go
back into my exploratory test extension
and you can see that I have annotation
from other tools so it's not just our
tool it's the tool that actually fits
your your purposes in your workflow best
and this is a logo issue okay
now I mentioned the fact that this was
resilient so at this point weapons if I
crash this application still running and
it may not be the the best citizen at
this point so let's go ahead and open up
task manager and we find our browser is
running and I'm going to go ahead and
just bring it down so at this point did
I lose everything
let's find out I'm gonna go ahead and
restart my browser and I'm gonna go
ahead and reopen the test extension and
you'll see right off the bat that not
only did I not lose my timeline and
actually remembered the bug exactly
where I was at so let's go ahead and
finish the typing of the title so logo
bug and what was that that was a iPad
air 2 I believe was actually what well
we had problem even though it occurs in
all places so at this point the only
thing left is to bring up full circle so
if I go ahead and let's look at parts
unlimited I want to show it back in the
development environment all those bugs
are actually we're brought back in and
we should be able to find those
so I'm going to open up my quarry parts
I'm gonna go to work and we should be
able to see right off the bat of the
right off the bat in our my backlog a
logo bug as my last one
so right there logo logo bug in air pad
to bringing exploratory testing all the
way into your development cycle making
it fit for your devices your operating
systems and your workflows as you saw we
had a great demo I know I actually had a
lot of fun showing it to you I just want
to recap what you saw we were able to
capture screenshots we were able to
annotate those screenshots both in the
tool that we're delivering and actually
in my case paintbrush we're able to
capture those notes as we walk through
it we filed a couple bugs too I think
and also we put all of this in a
timeline and it actually spanned a
couple of my different PBIS and we were
able to do the exact same work across
different devices showing you how the
resiliency even though we had a crash in
that case I was able to remember exactly
where we were and continue on going
forward my name is Charles sterling I
hope you have a great time to connect

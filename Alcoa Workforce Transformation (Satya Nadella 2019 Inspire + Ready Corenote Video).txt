>> We base our work culture
very much on the Alcoa values,
which is operate with excellence,
act with integrity, and the one
that I care about the most,
which is care for people.
>> We operate 24 hours a day,
365 days a year.
>> We have to know
what just happened?
What was happening yesterday?
What's happening tomorrow?
Communication was not
as good as it could be.
All our announcements were
coming through e-mail.
If I wasn't at work, I didn't see.
>> It was a challenge to make
sure everybody got the message.
It was like shouting out
into the void sometimes.
>> A lot of the challenge
is trying to get
the correct amount of
people for each shift.
With the magnetic board,
you had to physically be
there to get this shift.
This board was very inefficient.
>> The goal was connecting everybody,
and Teams was the tool
we found for this.
>> My first impression
of Teams was quite good.
I just go on my phone,
I see what shifts are open.
Click on the shift and request it.
It's really easy.
>> Being able to use that on
a mobile phone is amazing.
It's truly amazing.
>> Then at the end of every shift,
we write our shift messages
for the next one.
We use emojis and gifs.
It doesn't have to be
all seriousness. It can be fun.
>> Teams has allowed me to respond
to the people immediately.
>> We want everybody to be
heard and we want
everybody to be equal.
We're giving everybody a voice.
>> Alcoa's moving forward with
each generation and our generation
all have phones in their pockets.
So Teams is the future.

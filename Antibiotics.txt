hello guys this is dr. Marjorie from
Team MDS conquer will see the outline of
antibiotics in this video so these are
the contents of the video so this is the
antibiotic definition which was given by
Waxman it is a chemical substance
produced by the microorganisms and
inhibit the growth of or destroy the
other micro organisms in the high
dilution coming to the classification of
antibiotics which is important so
classification these are the
sulfadiazine derivatives dam i know
based on the chemical structure
classification this is and these are the
other drugs which was based on the
chemical classification which includes
macrolides night rocker and derivatives
imidazoles quinolones ecoute any caste
derivatives poly an antibiotics and
imidazole derivatives so based on the
mechanism of action this is the group of
drugs so this is based on the spectrum
of activity and this classification is
based on the type of action so those are
the important classifications which you
can have to mention in your exam then
coming to the sulfonamides this is the
classification of the sulfonamides based
on the action and this is the spectrum
of action where it is a bacteriostatic
and pharmacokinetics includes their
extensively bound to the plasma proteins
and this dough should be reduced in the
renal failure this is a mechanism of
action we're here this para my no
benzoic acid or the folate synthase is
converted into dihydrofolate code i draw
for later reductase which finally gives
rise to the tetrahydrofolate acid so in
this step the sulfonamides are you will
inhibit this step so you can see here
the sulfonamides will inhibit the step
here
trimethoprim will inhibit the step here
then these are the adverse effects of
the sulfonamides then coming to the uses
of sulfonamides this is the uses of the
sulfonamides you can mention here like
urinary infections toxoplasmosis and
lymphogranuloma venereum malarial CT of
colitis in ulcerative colitis we can use
for the prophylactic use use and this
other grosses of the drugs and which are
short intermediate and long acting then
coming to the cotrimoxazole this is a
bacteriostatic or a bactericidal drag
and trimethoprim plus alpha methoxy sole
is the cotrimoxazole then this is the
uses of the drug and this is the adverse
effect of the cotrimoxazole then coming
to the dosage for the children this is a
reps or a suspension and dry with the
prim overall and the sulfamethoxazole
then coming to the quinolones in alone
to the synthetic antimicrobial agents
and these are the examples of the
quinolones
and this is the adverse effect this is
the uses and this is the dosage you have
to mention
then coming to the floor open Alone's
and this fluoroquinolones are divided
into first generation second generation
and this is the examples of those
generations and the pharmacokinetics
into their early well observed and they
can cross the blood-brain barrier this
is the important thing and they are
antibacterial spectrum i got both
grandpa's t and gram limiting any routes
then this is the mechanism of action in
the bactericidal which decrease the DNA
gyrase where it is the RS the
multiplication by decreasing the
topoisomerase then these are the uses of
fluoroquinolones and this is the adverse
effects and this is one of the important
thing this is contraindicated after 18
years of a
so you can see that those ages of the
drugs of this fluoroquinolones you can
write few those ages if you need then
coming to the penicillin is very
important penicillin was discovered by
the Alexander Fleming so they're called
as beta lactams by him and if you see
the mechanism of action here see this
transpeptidase is a repents and binding
proteases will act here then
classification includes natural and semi
synthetic and these are the types of
pendulums in the semi synthetic group
like acid resistant pencil in a race
resistant a mine open saloons and anti
Pseudomonas penicillin and these are the
penicillin G it's spectrum of action
pharmacokinetics preparation and dosages
and adverse reactions and this is the
uses of this pencil ins and
disadvantageous then coming to the semi
synthetic consonants some a synthetic of
this is the acid resistant pencil ins
and this is this is about the penicillin
resistant the pencil ins then coming to
pencil in resistance pencil in the
examples of clocks is Alan Matheson and
I closest name and this is the dosages
of the drugs I'm mostly given four times
a day then extended spectrum in pencil
ins includes ampicillin and this is I
have an anti bacterial spectrum to both
gram positive and gram negative
organisms this is the adverse effects
and this is the uses you have to mention
and these are the few important points
of this ampicillin and this is the
dosage of the ampicillin
then amoxicillin differs because it is
better absorbed orally and food does not
interfere with this amoxicillin where
there is a dark or less by campus limb
which has an ester of ampicillin and
better observed and the area will be
rare and
long acting so this amoxicillin dosage
will be of 250 200 milligrams thrice
daily oral dosage then anti sudirman all
pencil ins includes carbon op a carboxy
pencil ins and you read open sealants
they'll examples include carbon is
ananda Karen Elson and these are the add
to again a Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Proteus infections whereas you read Oh
pencils will have a wide anti bacterial
spectrum activity then beta lactamase
inhibitors that is clavulanic acid no
antibiotic activity of its own and it
can be given with amoxicillin and also
de cárcel him then the second example is
of sul bottom it is combined with the
ampicillin and that has the bathroom can
be combined with the piperacillin
these are the therapeutic uses of this
Clavel aeneas inhibitors that is
clavulanic acid beta lactamase
inhibitors and mostly the my hello in
facial infections as the first drug of
choice will give the combination of this
amoxicillin with the clavulanic acid
then coming to the cephalosporins the it
is derived from the fungal cephalosporin
and these are the generations first
second third for generations of
cephalosporins available and this is the
parental first generation second or
first generation drugs these are the
second generation drugs third generation
directs and the fourth generation
examples first generation mostly active
again is gram positive but we gotta go
and gram negative second generation less
effective in is gram positive cocci
anaerobes and Pseudomonas effective a
guinness gram negative infection second
generation third generation more active
again as to there we made to Vaseline
Pseudomonas whereas fourth generation
mainly used in the gram-negative
infections and gram positive infections
so these are the uses of the
cephalosporins and this is the adverse
effects of the
then coming to the tetracyclines
tetracyclines or of this natural and
semi synthetic derivatives and inspector
of action includes gram-positive
gram-negative bacilli and also inhibit
the growth of protozoa mycoplasma so
this is mechanism of action includes on
50s and dry her tears subunits
tetracyclines will bind to the a site as
pharmacokinetics includes like
tetracycline chelate calcium and other
metals whereas dr. Selig is 95 percent
and we know cycle is hundred percent
observe this is very important and even
this point like they are distributed in
saliva and zzf are also very important
and this is the uses of the stretch
Recycling's
and contraindications in pregnancy
lactation children up to eight years and
this is the adverse effect then drug
interactions with carbamazepine
phenytoin barbiturates it will decrease
the half-life of tetracycline whereas
citrus eyes interfere with the pencil in
action also and this is the dosage after
eyes for adult and for the children then
semi-synthetic tetracyclines
like it given they are 95 to 100 percent
observed if they given orally and
minocycline dosage and this is the
doxycycline dosage and we mostly use the
periodontal infections then coming to
the floor chloramphenicol
chloramphenicol spectra from action
include gram positive gram negative
chlamydia and mycoplasma pneumoniae
species class now half luck will be of
1.5 to 3.5 hours and this is the adverse
effects of this chloramphenicol and the
uses it has a wide range of uses and
this is the preparations and dosage and
interaction is very important because it
increases the toxicity of target amide
and phenytoin
then coming to the micro Lites micro
Lites includes the erythromycin
interactions will be of toxicity with
the ketoconazole carbamazepine
theophylline and cyclosporine var var
Ferran and prednisolone and even it
interfere to the chloramphenicol and
clindamycin these are the preparations
and dosages and this is the adverse
effects of this microlight whereas these
are the uses of this macro lights then
rocks will throw myosin dizzy longer
acting as it's stable and more potent
one and here this clarithromycin this
you can use for the h pylori infection
that is climb through myosin
metronidazole plus ponder pro so this is
very important you have to mention that
is effective again is the h pylori
infections then as you throw myosin
it is also acid resistant it is having
longer a half-life then coming to the
clindamycin there is a well observed
orally and used mostly in the osteogenic
infections like osteomyelitis and
adverse effects like colitis and
diarrhea it is a prophylaxis and
treatment of anaerobic infection and
these are the dosage drug dosage is
given here then coming to the vancomycin
it is a methicillin-resistant four loko
k it is active and these are the drug
dosages then coming to a minor
glycosides amino glycosides are highly
water soluble and inhibit the protein
wall synthesis and it they'll have a
auto toxicity and the nephrotoxicity
streptomycin spectra mostly the
gram-negative bacilli kanamycin due to
its toxicity its use is limited only to
multi drug-resistant tuberculosis and
this is that preparations and dosage of
the can amazing and coming to the
gentamicin and this is the adverse
effects contraindication pregnancy then
these are the therapeutic uses
tobramycin has a better activity against
the Pseudomonas pair as amicus in used
in bacterium a septicemia
tuberculosis then neomycin this is
poorly observed orally so hence used
only topically then Amida's all
derivatives might renew days old this is
a powerful amoeba side and spectrum
includes entamoeba histolytica
trichomonas vaginalis Giardia lamblia
bland tedium okay an in an arabic
protozoa and these are the adverse
reactions and this is the dosage of the
drugs most we will use 400 mg in our
dental practice and these are the
interactions with barbiturates decrease
the efficacy with the samhita DNA
decrease the liver metabolism of
material and metals and produces
disulfiram right reactions and this is a
telepathic uses of antibiotics and this
is the dosage of antibiotics okay you
even they can use with a combination of
other drugs like metals or place off
boxes in might result less tetracycline
and might reduce will please amoxicillin
so that's it this is the complete basic
outline of the antibiotics how do you
how you have to present in your
examination which we can include like
what's the mechanism of action and what
are the uses a lot of the adverse
effects and if any present in you can
mention the interactions and finally the
doses okay these are the in fact and
these are the references of this video i
hope i hope it is very useful to
everyone
mmm thank you everyone have a great day

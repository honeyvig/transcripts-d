foreign
models the application layer is
responsible for maintaining a smooth
interaction between the application and
the user it is also responsible for
maintaining the network services that
the user use over the Internet services
hi guys I'm welcome to yet another
trusting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us now without further Ado
let's take a look at the agenda for
today's session where the first topic is
what is an osr model
continuing with what is the application
there moving forward with the functions
of the application layer in a network
model and the last topic is protocols in
the application layer let's take a look
at the first heading that is what is an
osm model The OSI or Open System
interconnection model is a specifically
designed set of protocols that govern
communication channels through which
network devices share information and
data this task of sharing and dividing
among the seven layers of the USM model
for micro level is known as the Osa
functioning now let's move on to the
main heading for this session that is
what is an application layer
the application layer acts as an
interface for the user and the
application being accessed
it manages the protocols required by the
application to present the data to the
user
they apply HTTP and SMTP and similar
protocols for the data transmission over
the network channel now let's move
forward with the next setting that is
functions of the application layer
but before we begin let's take a look at
the brief working of the application
layer in an osm model to begin with the
application layer we share data unit
with the lower layers where the work of
application layer is that it acts as an
interface between the user and the
system applications it is responsible
for applying multiple Network functions
and protocols to better understand the
data
and edit them for the lower layers
it applies multiple protocols in the
network channel
some of which are telnet DNS DHCP
now let's move on to the functions of
the application layer
where the first function is Network
virtual terminal
then we have file transfer access and
management
addressing
and mail and directory services
let's move forward with the first
Network function
Network virtual terminal
the application allows the user to
connect user system to a Remote device
to access functions and services
to establish remote access for the user
the application layer stimulates a
terminal at the remote host
let's take a look at the second function
file transfer access and management
the application layer through remote
accessing can transfer and manage files
for the user system in a Remote device
the file access of files is handled in
terms of file attributes such as file
structure and the functions applied to
the files along with the features
included in the file system over the
network channel
now let's move forward with the next
function of the application layer
that is addressing
the application layer to establish the
connection between the network devices
requires a need to access addresses
the application layer handles requests
from the client to the server device
this is possible by using the server and
the client address
the server will reply to the client's
address using the DNS service
for addressing reasons
now let's move forward with the next
function of the application layer
mail and directly services
the application layer function is also
responsible for handling email
forwarding and Storage
this function of the application layer
is also responsible for handling access
rights for Global Information on the
network services
with this we have completed all the
important functions applied in the
application layer in an osm model let's
move forward with the next setting that
is
the protocols of the application layer
the application layer provides multiple
protocols providing software with
multiple protocols for handling data
transmission and accessing the received
data over a remote access channel in the
network model
some of the application layers applied
in a network model are
telnet telnet refers to the
telecommunication Network this
application lab protocol is responsible
for handling access filing over the
internet
telnet protocol uses port number 23. in
the network channel
then we have DNS DNS stands for domain
name system
the DNS service protocol is designed to
translate the domain name into
corresponding IP addresses over the
network channel
the DNS protocol uses port number 53 in
a network model
then we have DHCP
DHCP stands for dynamic host
configuration protocol
which is responsible for assigning IP
addresses to the host Network
the DHCP protocol uses port number 67
and 68 in a network model
the last protocol for the application
layer is
SMTP the smtv protocol stands for simple
meal transfer protocol as the name
suggests this protocol is designed to
handle meal transmission from one user
to another user
the smtv protocol uses port number 25
and 587 over the network model for
transmission purposes
with this we have covered all the
important points regarding the
application layer in a nosm model if you
have any questions regarding the topic
you can ask them in the comment section

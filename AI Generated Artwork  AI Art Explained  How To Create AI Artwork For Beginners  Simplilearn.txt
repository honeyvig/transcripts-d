FastTrack your Ambitions whether you're
making a switch or aiming higher simply
learn has your
back just a quick info guys before we
move on simply learn has got applied
generative AI specialization course
where you're going to learn to deploy
and develop geni enabled applications
you also going to master generative AI
with this Cutting Edge AI applied course
with per University and simply learn so
guys this course you're going to explore
prompt engineering large language models
attention mechanisms RG and many more so
guys hurry up now and join the course
the course link is mentioned in the
description box so let's get started so
guys let's start with understanding
first what is an AI art AI art which is
also known as generative art is made up
of artificial intelligence unlike
digital art where human artists create
the work using their skills AI art is
actually produced by by computers you
basically provide a text description and
an AI which has been trained on vast
collection of images and text it also
generates a complete artwork based on
your input and the result is an image
created by an algorithm that understands
both visuals and language turning your
words into a finished piece of art now
you would be wondering how does these AI
generators work so Guys these air
generators create images from text using
Advanced Technologies like deep learning
algorithm and generative adversion
networks or Gans when a user basically
types in a series of descriptive words
the AI takes the input and based on the
training it generates an image that
matches your description during its
training the AI analyzes massive amount
of photos learning about various
characteristics like shapes Styles
colors and Ms this allows the AI to
replicate colors textures subject and
even mimic the styles of famous artists
quite interesting but some of the AI art
generators perform better than others
often because they were trained on
larger data sets and this type of AI
also plays a very important role now the
two main open source AI programs are di
by open AI who are the creators of CH
GPT and stable diffusion they are also
closed Source systems like mid journey
and adobe's Firefly now let's move on
and try to understand how to make an AI
art with the rapid rise in the
popularity of AI art generators there
are many options to create your own
masterpiece among the best are Jasper
Med journey and Leonard AI which offers
the topnotch features but they come
under the paid tools we'll also guide
you to some of the other tools which are
free like we have the Cana AI we have
Night CFE Ai and crayon AI so guys in
particular these tools are good at
producing Landscapes product shots food
images and many more making it an ideal
choice for bloggers and also for Content
creators now let us discuss some of the
top-notch tools the first one that we
have all over here is mid Journey AI so
guys this is an official website of mid
Journey Ai and now they have changed
their name to imagin Art in some of the
instances these are the image which are
generated by mid Journey have been so
realistic that they have been even
fooling the experts in photography and
other fields well it sounds kind of
naive but yes it did you will likely
come across convincing AI generated
images on social media like you can see
Pope Francis wearing a puffer jacket or
a fabricated image of trump being
arrested before the real event actually
happened additionally AI creativity
shines in unique generation such as Star
Wars scenes imagine styles of Wes
Anderson showcasing how AI can blend in
different Artistic Styles and in
surprising ways so guys you can see this
this is a med Journey the first thing is
you have to go for the sign in okay so
you can just continue with your Google
account and click on continue so guys
now you as you can see all over here
this is basically a paid platform okay
so when you are trying to create like
text to image okay suppose you want to
create this so suppose uh they will be
giving you some of the free tokens
say a dog on Mars and if I want to
generate the images so as you can see
all over here it has successfully
generated but you have some free tokens
all over here so you can utilize this to
do it and uh
similarly it's going to give you a lot
of alternative way to do it and this is
one of the best and there are more of
the things that you can find like AI
video you can create your own AI videos
such that like this one you can see the
resolution here is so nice let's try to
open this video and you can see like how
AI is really really brainstorming like
fooling us that this is actually a real
video so this is this is how the beauty
of mid journey is and you can do a lot
of things all over here so there are a
lot of features but the thing is it's
actually a paid tool so if you want to
fully utilize this tool then you have to
pay for it let us see what are the
pricings of uh this tool so say if you
want to upgrade you can see for the
standard they are giving you for $8 per
month okay for premium version they are
giving you around $13 per month and for
professional it's for $10 per month so
this is a pricing for Journey now let us
look at our next tool so as you can see
all over here this is a Jasper AI it's
also an powerful tool for creating or
generating images with the help of
artificial intelligence all you need to
do is provide some quick simple inputs
and Jasper will generate original high
quality content or an image tailored for
your needs it is basically a versatile
capable tools for creating various type
of contents like your blog post images
okay you can create a product
description and a product image and you
can see all over here these are the kind
of images it's creating and let us open
this image but before that you have to
log in and sign up so say let us start
with a free trial for Jasper so as you
can see all over here for Freelancers
and solopreneurs it is charging around
$39 per month for experts it's $59 per
month and uh let's it has you know if
you want some your customization it is
showing this it is similar like like mid
Journey what we have shown the features
and uh provided that it's also a very
awesome tool but it has pretty much had
a high end as if we compare the pricing
now it is also a kind of a very
userfriendly and a solid choice for
businesses of all sizes one of Jasper's
standout feature is a brand voice
basically it allows users to integrate
their unique brand identity into the AI
generated content this ensures that the
content which Jasper is creating matches
the Stone style and overall brand
identity Jasper can even learn specific
details about the company such as what
are the product cataloges audience
preferences and key talking so it's
overall most of you can think like in
preference to the businesses and it is
also one of the most amazing tool now
let us move on to our third tool so guys
this is Leonardo AI it is also an image
generator which is not to be confused
with famous Leos like DaVinci or the
Caprio but still making waves in the
world of AI art originally it was
designed to help users to create gaming
assets but leonard. a has since evolved
into fullscale AI content creation
service offering not just image tools
but also AI driven video creation and
editing Services leonard. a is a strong
Contender among various AI power tools
standing on par with Ado Firefly and
significantly outperforming options like
Google's image effects and canva it's
particularly good at following proms
accurately even more so than mid Journey
also though it does not offer as many
Advanced editing tools making is a
choice between the matter of preferences
while openis D 3 remains highly ranked
but you will need to pay for chat gbd
plus to access it but in contrast
leonard. a offers a comprehensive free
plan making it an appealing option for
those looking to explore AI content
creation without the cost and it's also
a very amazing tool so guys now let us
explore some of the free tools that are
available all over the Internet the
first one that is cron so cron is also a
very free tool so you can type any
command such as let us check
out white
unicorn horse in
Springfield okay this is a random image
generation okay prom which I have given
let us see how does it generates so if I
ask about so you can see it's still all
over here it's drawing and you can see a
lot of ads also coming up because it's a
free tool so uh this is the way of their
monetization and it might take some time
so you can see all over here there are
lot of images shown by here but it is
kind of a free tool and you can see it's
not so user friendly and it's it's not
so good also but still if uh you wanted
something like uh so you can see all
over here the image has been generated
all over here so this is pretty good but
still as to the tools but when comparing
to tools like mid Journey okay it's it
doesn't stand that well good now let us
explore our second free tool that is
happier AI now its UI looks pretty
better as compared to the other one and
uh let us type something
like create image
of pond with alligators
and
Fishes okay
playing in 8 so so let us see how does
this creates but they have their beta
version also and I think so you can
upgrade this and it's definitely going
to offer some better Services as
compared to the other tools so let's
just
wait so guys as you can see all over
here it is taken certain a long amount
of time to create this image but it
looks pretty much better uh the quality
is also pretty nice so you can see it
has the capability to create an art
provided you have to give the right
proms that's only one thing so it's a
very rare scenario where alligators and
fishes are playing but you know that's a
random imagination that's one thing it's
a very nice tool you can see there are a
lot of features all over here so suppose
all over here it takes you to the
homepage and there are certain kind of
images like uh videos basically it has
created so you again check out this tool
it is also pretty awesome as an open
source now let us move to our final tool
that is night Cafe it is also one of the
most amazing tools and it is available
for free so guys you can create
something like this all over here so
there's a beautiful ancient sakura tree
in front of a lake okay so suppose this
is what is and let us just try to create
with this prompt and you can see all
over here so you have to continue with
the Google sign in all over here and now
they have made it kind of a paid version
I think so you get certain amount of
credits to create images so with more
number of accounts you can definitely
access it for free but for uh if you go
for the paid version so you get lot of
uh really benefits like your image
generation is faster you get high
quality and lot of other tools you are
going to get so you can see the text
prompt was a beautiful ancient sakura
tree in front of a lake mountains and
Japanese Temple in the background so you
can see such a beautiful image this uh
tool has created so that's what the
beauty of AI tool you know it can craft
your imagination into one of the most
interesting pieces and definitely it
looks very appealing so a lot of content
creators bloggers are using this and
they are definitely doing great stuffs
with these tools now now let us try to
understand what are the best practices
for making AI art the first and foremost
is crafting a good prompt so as you can
see all over here you should mention a
prompt something like this suppose if I
say I wanted to create an Assassin
Creed's character okay and what kind of
style I want to put it down so I just
said video game style and the image
should be sharp and it is detailed fine
green blue and green shades are given up
you need to have a sharp Focus cinematic
lightning studio photography this is
more about knowledge that you have about
how what are the things that are
required in a photograph and you can see
all over here the image is looking very
sharp you know it is detailed and it's
definitely very appealing so you need to
craft a very good prompt which include
these kind of styles and features then
only these uh image generating tools are
going to craft your images the next
thing which I found uh more interesting
is combining different platforms for
instance uh as you can see all over here
this is a bus okay a truck and this was
created on Leonardo AI then this file
was imported to photoshop so you can see
the tone has increased in this uh
picture and afterwards it's looking more
like a solid and little bit more
in-depth tone for this images so you can
combine platforms for creating the
images and you can see some diverse
results also and uh the this is one of
the technique I generally follow and you
should also try this definitely there
are better results for this the third
one that comes up to my mind is
experimenting with the Styles so you
should always experiment uh the images
with the Styles different styles are
present just try to incorporate it and
try to test and experiment mostly so
with these three Paradigm you can
definitely get some unique results and
definitely it's going to make your image
a lot more better so guys that was all

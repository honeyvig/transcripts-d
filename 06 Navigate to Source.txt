here on line 18 I'm making a method call
into a nougat package called
newtonsoft.json and I don't really know
what's going on inside the method called
serialize object I might be able to find
the source code somewhere on GitHub and
then go figure it out but it would be
really nice if there's a way for me to
just go straight to the definition hit
F12 and go to definition so let's try
that and it takes me straight to the
source so this is not disassembly or
anything like that this is the actual
source code using something called
Source link all nougat packages can opt
in to Source link and that will allow
Visual Studio to understand how to get
to the actual source code that made up
this particular version of this nougat
package and even when you're inside
these files you can keep hitting F12
until we come down here and it's a
serialized object internal and this is a
private string so I'm F 12ing I'm going
to definition through a file that made
up the nuget package that I'm working on
and I can see everything that's
happening so super helpful

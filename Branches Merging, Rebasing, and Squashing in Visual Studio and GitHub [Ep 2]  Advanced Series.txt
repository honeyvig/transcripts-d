hi everyone thanks for joining this
session on integrating branches merging
rebasing and squashing in visual studio
and GitHub where we'll cover the
different ways you can integrate changes
from other branches using git and how
each Works in vs and on the web in
GitHub whether you merge or rebase a
secondary Branch you'll end up with the
same changes being added to your primary
Branch the different lies in how the
commits are connected in your git
history
when merging your primary Branch will
get a new merge commit and you'll have
the entire history of the second Branch
preserved as a detour in your graph as
shown in the graph here when rebasing
every commit in your secondary Branch
gets replayed on top of your primary
Branch as if you made those commits on
your primary Branch to begin with as
shown in the graph here you can see they
have the same commits but are connected
differently compared with merging you
get a cleaner history and a linear
commit graph which is helpful for
rolling back
changes sometimes these actions result
in merge conflicts which we covered in
more detail in another
video Once you pick your method it's
easy to either merge into current Branch
or rebase current Branch onto from the
context
menu when you complete a poll request on
GitHub you can choose from the following
options and your organization can
configure which merge type it allows on
a given
Branch when either of these strategies
are combined with squashing you lose the
individual commits from the secondary
branch and the result is a single commit
with a new commit message this is useful
if you want to throw away the source
Branch completely going from a branch
with multiple commits into a single
commit to squash simply hold control and
select a set of commits you'd like to
combine into a single commit and
rightclick and select squash
commits
thanks for watching
everyone

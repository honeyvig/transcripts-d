hey everyone welcome to this video on
backend interview questions
now web development that occurs at the
back end of the program is called
back-end development
and back-end development generally
covers server-side web application logic
writing apis creating libraries and so
on
now we must also know that back-end
developers are highly in demand
now we must also know that back-end
developers are in great demand today so
if you wish to make your career as a
back-end developer then here's the right
video for you in this video we cover
questions on top back-end
technologies but before we begin if you
haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update so here are the technologies
covered
first up we'll look at questions on node
moving on we'll look at a few questions
on php
and then we'll go to database management
system like sql
and then we'll look at docker
jenkins maven
and selenium so i hope these questions
help you and let's dive right in
hello this is matthew and we're going to
be going through some of the simple
questions that you would be asked during
a node.js interview
what we're going to do is we're actually
going to break out the section into
three key areas there'll be beginner
questions there will be intermediate
questions and advanced questions
and the expectation is as you go through
this video is that these questions could
be
pushed together as you're going through
the interview kind of think of it like
this is if you've answered the beginner
questions that you would get asked at
the beginning of the interview with
confidence and surety
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate advanced questions
quite quickly and they're looking for
people who can help them serve and solve
their problems at that more intermediate
and advanced level so let's just get
started
so the first question you're probably
going to be asked is you know you know
what is node.js you know do you know
what it's for and essentially node.js is
one of the most popular if not the most
popular uh open source cross-platform
javascript programs and it allows you to
build out web applications that run on
the server it's extremely flexible it
allows you to implement a lot of
solutions outside of just the core
programming runtime and allows you to
build solutions extremely quickly in an
open source mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client size web applications
we'll see this later on and you may want
to talk a little bit about
using express js and how you can build
out apis
to work with node.js and connecting to
databases such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store
data intensive applications that are
asynchronous and event driven in their
model
and this is important when you're
talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you're going to then ask be asking
how does nodejs work well nodejs itself
is actually built on the v8 engine and
the v8 javascript engine is the same
engine that runs javascript in your
chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking
through your i o input outputs and is a
single threaded event loop
so you're going to be then asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding um but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications
probably referencing the web
applications is a really good starting
point because here you can actually talk
about maybe some examples that you've
done where you're building out some of
these web applications
indeed one of the things that you want
to be consistently doing and peppering
your answers with is examples of work
that you have done now it doesn't matter
if those examples are purely
experimental or
training examples that you've done the
fact that you've actually worked with
node.js and created a distributed system
or a web application is really valuable
because it shows that the person that
you're meeting with that you have
knowledge and understanding and
practical experience of applying the
theory of working with node.js with the
practice of working with nodejs
so be asked about you know
essentially the io refers to the
transfer of data in and out of
a system and that's really it you know
and there's a reason why google calls
their conference io it's the transfer of
data in and out of our brains at that
conference the application is same here
it's about moving data in and out of
systems through using node.js
and that every um event can be tracked
whether it's on a physical device a
network or files within a system again
it's input and output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked yo can you explain the
difference between front-end and
back-end development and this is a
question that i get asked a lot when i'm
meeting with clients um you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line
front-end is what gets resolved inside
of your web browser or the app on your
mobile device back-end is what gets
resolved um essentially um what we call
the the back office or server side
applications but it's becoming more and
more synonymous for what gets run in the
cloud
so web applications um really get a lot
of the functionality of a web
application gets run in the front end
anything with css html5 uh client-side
javascript so we can get right in the
front end everything else such as
connecting to a database um gets run
behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like graphics is going to be on the
front end uh apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are used on
on the front end uh so html css
javascript those are all common
core scripting languages that you would
use
you can use frameworks such as angularjs
and react.js or vue
those would be a front-end frameworks
backend frameworks will include java php
python
and node.js are some of the back-end
technologies you'd also
throw in there
net as well i mean it's just the whole
you know litany of front-end and
back-end technologies and frameworks
that you can use
and this is actually a good point to
kind of explain the experience you have
outside of just working with node.js but
other technologies that you've been
working with that potentially that the
client is also using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify their
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them
includes references to mpm
so you're going to be asking you know so
okay you've told me um what it is you
know can you go into a little bit more
um details you know can you provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to
manage online repositories of modules
and packages um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org
and you can find a packages that you can
install into your solution
such as express.js
and it also provides a command line
utility that allows you to manage
your packages very quickly through
terminal window or command line
i use vs code a lot visual studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with
npm so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules um in
node.js they're essentially like
javascript libraries so you can think of
some of the javascript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance
if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side
shows that we really do need to have
http which is a web server and we
require that to be installed and so that
if you're running that
npm package it will actually install the
http server and then you can actually
write some code to actually then listen
on the local host port 2000 for where
you'll be running your application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules that come
with node.js right out of the gate and
here are some of the modules that you
have and we also referenced that just
earlier on http is a core module for
running a
web server
you have a utility function that is
useful for developers to
assess and features within your node.js
project you have a url
module for any url passing you'd be
doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's being worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files
to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over back end technologies
such as java and php and particularly
gyro it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know php
runs some of them the
most powerful and largest websites out
there such as facebook so why would you
use node.js well the first response is
kind of a gimme but it is really fast
and if you watched any of the videos
that we've done on node.js
building out solutions and developing
the solutions you'll see just how fast
it is
the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as express
or as a database into your
solution
really quickly and there's over 50 000
bundles available for node package
manager
if you're building out a
real-time application that's data
intensive and you need to have apis
quickly developed then node.js is
another great it's really the great
solution for you it allows you to build
out these solutions really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up
node.js because you have that common
language of javascript
and on top of that javascript is the
world's most popular
scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular and node.js
and so the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end
framework and a back-end framework and
this is one of those questions where you
can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other
so angular is a front-end development
framework whereas node.js is a
server-side in framework other
differences though between the actual
frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of javascript node.js is
written in c and c plus plus
angular is used for building out single
page
client-side web applications and so
that's a key word there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side network
applications and so
again the two complement each other
uh angular splits web applications into
the mvc and model view control
components whereas node.js generates a
lot of database grades it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js that glue to your database
so let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so um you're going to
probably be asking what is um
the most popular database used with
node.js and there are a couple um
mongodb is largely the most popular
nosql cross-platform database
mysql is also very popular and that's a
more traditional relational database
um you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses
of data that has to be
created read updated and deleted very
very quickly
for
some of the other popular libraries that
you use for node.js express.js is a very
popular one and i really like working
with express.js
allows me to build out web applications
really quickly uh more importantly it
allows me to build out apis very quickly
and which you know apis are essentially
web applications themselves but being
able to do that very quickly with a
framework like express.js is very useful
uh mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so um here is an example of
express.js which is a in itself really a
flexible budge a solution that you can
do lots with and mongoose which is a
more
focused solution
which allows
you know to you make it easier to
connect to your databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out
applications that run on the cloud why
would you you know what are the pros and
cons so a pro is that
node.js is extremely fast a processing
an event-based model
it really is fast a con is if you have
something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that
now i will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so
you might have to be provide an example
of what a very heavy computational task
is and that may be
calculating
a risk on an insurance application
against
many many variables that may be
something that's seen as computationally
very heavy but what you can do in that
example is you can offload
the task to another solution that's
designed for it and use apis to pass the
data back and forth
pro
javascript is used for building out your
applications with
node.js great lots of people know
javascript
a
restriction and again this is evolving
as javascript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks
if you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that i always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier
how do you get around that barrier and
so for instance when you're talking uh
to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why i use
node.js is that it's fast it's event
based driven i can use javascript there
are some challenges and but what i do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or java or php
and then use an api to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of both worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js
the node package manager makes it
extremely easy to access just an awful
lot of functionality with over 50 000
packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a
tool that creates unique identifiers
that you might need to have for
generating content that gets posted into
a database through to being able to
connect to databases through you know to
running so many different solutions and
the npm package manager with its access
to so many different packages makes it
great
for um getting access to all that
content now khan is
working with relational databases with
node.js isn't as easy as a nosql
database now you can do it and there are
ways around that and what i would do
when this question comes up is always
kind of pivot to say hey this is how you
can actually then
get around building out that application
pro for node.js designed for streaming
huge amounts of data in and out a con is
that node.js is singles threaded so it
can be cpu intensive
but again there are ways around that and
a good way around that is scaling your
solution in an elastic environment such
as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external library the command is the
required command and so an example we
have here is uh you can start a variable
and the variable's going to be for http
and you're going to then require the
http service and that means that the
application itself won't run unless the
external library the http library is
installed
okay so those were our introductory
questions for node.js let's kind of
pivot and take a look at the
intermediate questions that you would be
asked
so what does event-driven programming
mean so event-driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse
that mouse click is an event that means
something has to respond to that event
uh just think of it as cause and effect
it's just the basic motion of physics so
that's what event driven programming
means
you also look at it as a callback
function
so that when an element is executed
something will happen in response
so what is an event loop in node.js
so an event loop in node.js is when you
do an asynchronous call and
what that essentially means is that
you're sending out
data and then non-blocking input output
from node.js is pulling data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event emitter has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects uh
within your event and we have an example
of this on the right hand side
and then whenever an event actually is
thrown
the functions are then called on that
event synchronously
so for instance we have in our example
on the right hand side we create an
event and then we have the functions and
that executed in a series from
that event
so let's talk about the api functions in
node.js so there's two types
one is an asynchronous non-blocking
function
and the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no uh structure to the order
for how the
api is resolved synchronous means that
when the feedback from the api is
received you have to execute
the response in a series for how the
response is sent to you
so what is a package.json file so the
package.json file is at the heart of our
node.js
package where we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be a
node.js
package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out um how to create that root package
and you'll see how you can actually then
go ahead and update the instructions or
the metadata within the package
so here we have an example of what that
metadata looks like so again this kind
of continues that question of what is a
package.json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a
basic uh json collection of pairing of
a key details such as name version
description and then the custom version
that you put so for instance under name
you could create a name for your project
there can't be any spaces uh what is the
version and the description and what is
the main or starting path
for the solution typically that would be
index.js but it could be anything.js but
index.js is typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a url module in
node.js
so with the url module what it allows
you to do is really two things one is
that it provides the resolution passing
of a url
for utilities in your application
and then it allows you to
extend your module with built-in
solutions and split up the web address
into a readable format
so in this example
we have the url and
the response it would give
for that url which would then be a year
and month
and it'd be in a readable format so you
would read out as
2020 and then the month
so
what is express.js and you've heard me
mention this a couple of times in the
video and we actually have a separate
video on express.js and express.js is a
web application framework that allows
you to build out web solutions
for both mobile and traditional desktop
right inside of node.js so it's very
easy to use
um being able to install and web.js is
as simple as requiring express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js uh so in this
example uh you start off the first two
lines uh require express to be installed
and the store comes from node packet
manager then we have a simple
application that will then send to the
browser window
a hello world message confirming that
express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
virus server actually will define the
port
where your application is going to run
so in this instance
the port is going to run on localhost
and the
port will be port 8081
and so you can actually go to localhost
colon8081
and when you do that that will trigger
the application that will forward up the
message hello world and it's all coming
from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable stream through which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to
a duplex is a stream where is both
readable and writeable
and
transform our streams that can be
manipulate the data
while it is being read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install uh something like express so
if you wanted to install express what
you would do is you would just write
them inside of your project you want to
go to terminal window and write in the
command npm install express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js
that's using the uninstall command and
so that would again be going to terminal
window and you would type npm uninstall
express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command
the http service is actually built into
node.js you don't need to use express.js
i typically use express.js when i want
to do a web server because typically
what i find is that i will want to go
and do something more complicated but if
you want to do something that
illustrates just the core functionality
uh within node.js you can actually just
uh require the core http service that
actually comes as part of node.js and
then you can actually then go ahead and
tell it to create a service and then to
write in plain text a command
or text string such as in this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
uh listen that if you go to a web
browser that's on port
127.0.01 or localhost um and go to
port colon 8080 once you actually go to
that that will trigger this application
and you'll get the text hello world pop
up on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis
in node.js are asynchronous which means
that they are non-blocking which means
you can run them continuously um and
scale around that which is just
fantastic so one of the reasons why
node.js can scale so fast and the eighth
means that the apis can return data send
data after it's been called and really
increase the efficiency of events as
they are triggered within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example
it's actually something that can be done
very quickly in this example we're
actually
making a command to logo host and app
that's running on port 3000 and then
depending on
what we get if there's an error message
and then we'll have error message go to
the console log which is the terminal
window and if we get a response to an
application
then we'll actually get a positive
response which would be fetched response
so
again very quickly and easy that you use
the async function
to be able to build out and you to get
your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so
a module export is a way to encapsulate
your the entire code for a solution in a
single package in a single file and then
you can then
share that with other developers so
you're all working from the same
environment
so what is a callback function in
node.js a callback function is
essentially that once you run and you've
triggered an event and the response has
been given
you want to be able to then have a
callback to validate that the task is
complete
all right let's move on to the final set
of questions which is advanced nodejs
questions
so what is repple in node.js so repl
stands for read eval print and loop and
this is a reference to the
unix and linux background that nodejs
has
so rapple will form the following tasks
the read will be actually
passing the javascript you'll read that
and store it in memory eval
takes and evaluates the data structure
print will then print the results often
on the console window or onto a web page
and then loop um loops the above command
until the user presses control c twice
what is the control flow function
so the control flow function is a piece
of code that runs between several of the
asynchronous functions and that's it it
actually controls how those functions
execute
so how control flow controls the
function calls and it does it through
four ways one is it controls the order
of execution
it collects the data it limits the
concurrency and then it also calls the
next step in a program again this is a
management tool for how your functions
are called within node.js
so what is the difference between fork
and spawn methods in node.js
so the essential difference between the
two of them is that if you use the fork
method it will actually trigger and
create a new instance
of the v8 engine the engine running
node.js
and will then run the application in
that new instance
with spawn
it's somewhat similar it doesn't
actually generate a new v8 instance so
it's actually creating a new process but
it's within the same v8 instance as the
previous application that it was spawned
from
explain to me what is the use of buffer
class in node.js
so with the buffer class what you're
looking at doing is you're actually
controlling the raw data of a set of
arrays and integers and the memory
allocation outside of the v8 heap buffer
class is used because pure javascript is
not compatible with binary data
what is piping in node.js
so
piping is the ability to connect the
output
of one stream to another stream that
could be a data stream it could be any
stream that you're working with
but it does normally get used to pass
data from one stream to another
so what are some of the flags used in
the rewrite operation files
so r dash is used for read w's for
opening a file for writing
a dash is opening a file for appending
so the collection that you have here you
don't have to really memorize all of
them but to have a few of them in the
back of your mind is always a good
reference point
so how would you open a file using
node.js
so
the syntax you would use would be
the
fs.open and that would then open up a
file
explain to me what callback hell is uh
so callback hell also known as the
pyramid of doom is when you have too
many
nested unreadable and unmanageable
callbacks intensively cycle within each
other and they're constantly reading to
each other and they're not able to
resolve the solution
and uh this is a you know it's a big
problem and this is what why it's called
call back how because you're not able to
finalize the the app you're working on
what is a reactive pattern in node.js
and so a reactor pattern is a concept of
non-blocking i o operations
can you explain to me the test pyramid
for node.js so the test pyramid and this
is standard for testing uh for all
devops is really split into three key
areas you have unit tests integration
tests and then end to end or e2e tests
the unit tests are tests that you
actually do in your raw code
that you're working on and the goal
there is to be able to validate that the
code you're writing is consistently
working
integration allows you to
have tests that integrate your raw code
that you're working with in your
application with other areas of an
application and then end to end is the
whole system the whole interface as it
were
for your solution
describe the exit codes of node.js
so annexa code is a specific code that
identifies the end of a specific process
and examples of exit codes are
unused uncalled fatal exception
fatal error
internal javascript evaluation area
these are all good examples of exit
codes so what is
a middleware can you explain the concept
of middleware in nodejs
so
with middleware it is the ability to be
able to connect to a system and get data
from it that's outside of node.js so
this may be executing a type of code or
updating a modifying request in response
to a specific type of object
finishing the request response cycle
can you explain to me what are the types
of http requests that you may use when
working with node.js
there are actually quite a lot but four
of them that you might use would be get
post
head and delete
and these are if you've done any uh web
application before particularly worked
with forms inside of a web application
you're probably very familiar certainly
with get and post again it's the request
to retrieve data post is generally used
for changing stating and data
head is similar to get but also ask for
a response if there's no body content so
if you're using if you're developing an
api this would be a good one to use and
delete is used to delete the
predetermined source
so how would you connect to mongodb
database and with node.js and you'd use
that using the client and the
example we have on the left hand side
and illustrates that
what is the use of node underscore emv
and so the node unscrew emv is an
environment variable that stands for
node environment in express server so
the example we have on the right hand
side allows you to illustrate how you
would do that for say a production
environment
so what are some of the various timing
features in node.js so
the timing functions that you could use
here set timeout and then clear timeout
and you to schedule code execution that
you'd have inside of your application
you also have set interval clear
interval to execute a block of code up
multiple times in your application
set intermediate and clear intermediate
to
execute code and that is at the end of
your application
we'll discuss some of the frequently
asked questions in php interviews
now the questions are categorized in two
sections beginner and advanced questions
so without any further ado let us get
started with the beginner questions
now the most basic question
is what is php so php stands for
hypertext preprocessor
it is a server-side scripting language
that is embedded into html and is
generally used for dynamic web
development
php is also a very compatible language
that is it also works efficiently with
almost 20 different databases such as
mysql post resequal etc
next question what is a session in php
now sessions in php are used to store
data for users under a unique id which
can be then used across multiple web
pages of a website
next what is peer in php now peer
stands for php extension and application
repository it is a framework and
repository for the reusable components
focus on reusable components of php
containing code snippets and libraries
next
is php considered a case sensitive
language so this is a very often asked
questions in interviews so php is
partially case sensitive since variables
in php are case sensitive while
functions and user-defined functions are
not
next
name
different types of data types in php
so different data types in php include
integer
float
string
boolean array object
null and finally resource so there are
total eight different data types that
exist in php
next question
how is echo different from print
now echo it can output multiple strings
at a time while in case of print it can
output only a single string
now echo does not have a return value
while print always returns one
that is the reason that is echo is
faster because it does not have to
return a value while it is print is
slower in comparison to echo because it
always returns a value now as you can
see
both of these commands echo and print
are used in the exact same way
next
what are the rules for naming a variable
now there are certain rules which you
have to follow or certain
good coding practices which you have to
follow while naming a variable in your
php code so variable name must always
begin with underscore or a letter so it
cannot begin with a number or a special
character for that matter next variable
names can include numbers but not
special characters so
suppose you want to name your variable
number one two three so you can use this
variable but you cannot use number at
the read one two three since special
characters are not included
next a variable in php is declared using
this dollar sign followed by the
variable name
now as you can see this is how we
declare a variable dollar my underscore
variable you can also put a number in
between or at the end while naming a
variable just not at the start next
name some popular php frameworks so some
of the popular php frameworks include
symphony codeigniter
cake php and laravel
moving on
how to check if a defined variable is
null or not
so if a thank function is used to check
if the defined variable has any value or
not
so to use this suppose you have this
block of code in front of you so
suppose you want to check if this x
variable that you've defined is null or
not so what you do is you put the is it
function inside the if condition and it
will return
true if it's
not null
while it will return false
if it is a null value since it is not
null it returns true and we can
display echo as variable x is not null
while in the case of variable y it is a
null value sin so the if condition will
be false and it will not display
anything
next
how are objects in php passed so objects
in php are always passed by value not by
reference
next question
how to display output directly to the
browser now
in cases you want to display your output
directly onto the browser while
running a piece of code you can use it
use
these special tags
to display an output directly to the
browser now as you may notice
these tags does not contain the php
written you can use them directly and
replace php with an equal to sign
followed by what you want to display and
end it with a question mark and a
closing bracket
moving on
what is defined function used for in php
now define is used to declare a constant
in php
also in contrast to the variables
there's no need for a dollar sign before
declaring a constant since the value of
a constant does not change
this is how you can use the defined
function to declare a constant suppose
you want to declare the value of pi
as 3.14 throughout your php code and
which cannot be changed so we can use
define for that
next question is related to this
question since
what is constant functioning used for in
php then so constant function returns
the value of a constant it is not used
to define a constant but it returns the
value of a constant so
suppose you define a function constant
using this defined function and you want
to return this value
you can use this constant function for
that
next
is multiple inheritance supported in php
so php only supports single level
inheritance which means a class can be
extended from only one class using the
keyword extended
next
what are the different types of loops in
php so php consists of
a while loop
a do while loop a for loop and finally a
for each loop so php consists of total
for loops
next question
how to concatenate two strings in php
now
two strings can be easily concatenated
using the dot operator in php now to do
that
i'll show you with the help of a code
suppose you want to concatenate or join
these two strings str1 hello guys and
the second string would be and welcome
to simply learn and want to display
these strings together so to do that you
need to use this dot operator in echo as
you can see
this dot operator so first you write
this name of the first string
then followed by the dot operator i've
given this space
and then the next order operator because
this is also going to considered as a
string and then the third string
variable
and this is how you concatenate two
strings
next question what is the use of
function num ar argument
now this function as you can see
is used to return the number of
arguments passed in a function so
suppose you pass a certain number of
arguments in a function and want to know
how many
values or arguments for past you can use
this function for that so suppose in
this sample code you want to know how
many arguments were passed in this
sample function so to do that we declare
a variable number of arguments and we
will equal it to the function of number
function number argument
now we will display it
and this sample has passed three
arguments so the output would be three
moving on
what are super global variables in php
now some predefined variables in php are
known as super global variables because
they are always accessible from any
function file or class regardless of
this code so in all in all they are
globally accessible so suppose you write
a piece of code and you declare a
variable inside it it would be a local
variable and could be accessed only in
that part of the code but in case of
super global variable they are
accessible throughout the entire code
they include global server request post
get files enb cookie and session
moving on
how to invoke single line and multi-line
comments
now a single line comment in php can be
made using this hash followed by the
comment or
double slash followed by the comment
while in case of multi-line comments you
can use this hash star and write your
comments in multiple lines and enclose
it with a star and slash
what i am going to do now is i am going
to show you
the
use of these comments in actual vs code
now let us take this block of code for
example
now suppose you want to add a com single
line comment after this variable so what
you will do is
you can use this double slash
this
is a
variable
also you can use
slash
this is also a
variable so this is a single line
comment now if you try to write
something else
after this in the next line it will take
it as part of the code not part of the
comment so what do you do
when you need to write multiple lines of
comment so suppose
you need to write two three lines about
this
line of code what you will do is you
will use a slash
star
now write the comment
this
is displaying
simply learn
so this is a three line comment
which you can end simply
by star and a slash
this is how you write single line and
multi-line comments
now let's move on to the next question
that is
name some common applications of php so
some of the
most commonly used php applications are
system functions
firm handling so php is very commonly
used to handle the forms that you see on
the web pages
cred tasks now credit tasks are create
read update and delete so when you will
be working with databases this is a very
important part of using databases that
is crud and php is used very commonly in
that
next accessing cookies variables and set
keys
and finally data encryption php provides
security through some of its frameworks
which can be used
and is used very commonly throughout a
lot of websites
so now that we have gone through the
beginner level questions that are
frequently asked in php interviews
let us now move on to the advanced level
questions
so
the first question would be how can you
execute a php script from the command
line
now a php script from a command line can
be executed
by by opening the command line
and inside the command line you have to
specify the name of the script or name
of the php file that you want to run
suppose you want to run a php underscore
script.php
so you type in the name
of the php script that you want to run
and that particular php script will be
executed
next
differentiate between a dollar variable
and double dollar variable so what is
the difference between the two
now in case of a single dollar variable
is it is a simple variable that is
simply used to store data so as we
discussed earlier
it is a variable that we defined to
store different data types such as
integer float strings etc
while
a double dollar variable is a reference
variable of variable so
this is used to reference already
existing variables now to use
or to understand how these two work
you can see this
particular block of code here now in
this code what you need to focus on is
this is a simple variable hello which
contains the string welcome to
simplylearn and we have defined another
variable as where
which contains a string hello now in
this
echo as you can notice what we are doing
is we are using this
also before that you need to notice is
this is
the same string as the name of this
variable so first we are displaying this
variable and then we are referencing
this variable here
so what it is doing is it is referencing
the value to another variable so hello
variable is being referenced so
when you execute this block of php
script what you get the output is hello
since this is the variable hello and
after that what you'll
get is welcome to simply learn since
this variable is a reference to this
variable
next
differentiate between get and post
method
now
get method is used to submit form data
while post method is also used for the
same
feature
so the difference between them is get
method sends data as part of php page
url sorry webpage url while a post
method sends data through http header
in get
the data since the data has been sent
through the url it is displayed in the
url of the webpage so it is not secure
while in case of post method it is a
secure form of
data transfer
hence
when developing a website for some
security purposes usually we prefer post
method
next up
how to connect to a database using a php
script
now suppose
if you
are asked this question in an interview
what you need to do is you need to just
write this block of code and explain it
to the interview now suppose we have a
php script
and we want to connect it to a database
what we need to do is we will create
three different
variables that is server name username
and password now
what we are going to do is we will
create another variable con that will be
used to connect it and then we will use
the
mysqli functions which will then
pass these variables to create a
connection so these variable values are
localhost username password these are
the default values now to check if the
connection is connected
what we are going to do is
we will
use an if condition
if the con variable
gets and connect error we will display a
error message that is connection field
if not we will display connected
successfully
now as you can see here
these names can be the name of the
server that you're trying to connect i
have used localhost username password
for the default values you can use the
name of the database that you're trying
to connect your php script to
next up
what does final class and final method
mean in php
now a final class in php means that the
class cannot be extended
while a final method means that it
cannot be overridden
now as you can see in this block of code
we have used the final keyword for a
class and the final keyword for a
function
now suppose
this final class is
being inherited by this child class what
the program will return is an error
because once you use this final keyword
this class cannot be inherited and
similarly
suppose this function is trying to be
overridden
by this part of the code
it cannot be because we have used the
final function
next question
differentiate between function
overloading and overriding
now
function overloading the same function
is used for different purposes
based on the number of arguments inside
the function while in case of function
overriding
the same name and same argument function
is used in parent and child class
respectively to change the behavior of
parent class method now let me show you
and demonstrate the difference with an
example
so
let us look at this code so suppose you
have a function named show title
which does have contain a single
parameter and displays when called upon
using this parameter displays function1
now if you want to use the same
name of the function for a different
purpose what you can do is you can
increase or change the number of
parameters inside the function that is
it now contains two parameters so when
the same function is called using two
parameters it will function differently
and display function overloading so this
is how function overloading works
next
from this piece of code we can
understand function overriding suppose
you display a function demo in a base
class and you want to override this demo
function inside the
derived class so what you do is you make
another function with the same name
inside the derived class with some
different properties as you can see it
displays something different
now you create an object for the base
class and when you use this base class
object to call this demo function
you can use the properties of this
function here while if you create
another object that is object 2 for the
derived class and you use this object to
call upon the same demo function you are
overriding this base class demo function
that was inherited instead what it will
use is it will use the properties of the
derived demo function so that is how you
overload or override a class
function in php now let's move on to the
next question that is differentiate
between equal to equal to and triple
equal operator
so a double equal operator is generally
used to check if the value of two
operands are equal or not it is
generally used in case of conditional
statements
while a triple equals to operator
performs a type save comparison which
means that will that it will only return
true if both operands have the same type
and the same value
so you can understand this more with
this piece of code so suppose
in this case
since they both are equal it will return
true
while in this case they both have the
same type hence it will return true now
let us
next check this equals to equal so since
they both are one and in php it will
display as true since they are equal
while
when you are type checking that is you
are checking if they are equal with the
same type and same value it will display
a false since one is an integer and the
other one is a string value
also if you check two different strings
with the type save it will also display
true
next question
how does exception handling work in php
so when an exception is thrown
code following the statement will not be
executed and php will attempt to find
the first matching catch block so if an
exception is not caught a php fatal
error will be issued with an uncaught
exception an exception can be thrown and
caught within php
so what we do is we use this try and
catch
method to
try the code and if an error occurs we
can catch
if an exception occurs we can throw it
and the catch function will catch
the exception and if there's we do not
include the catch function it will
result in a fatal error
next up
differentiate between require and
include
now require if a required file is not
found it will throw a fatal error and
stop the code execution while in case of
include if an essential file is not
found it will produce a warning and
still execute the remaining scripts
so as you can see both of these include
and require i use in the exact same way
with different functions next up
explain different types of errors in php
now php consists of mainly three errors
notice
warning and a fatal error now notice is
a non-critical error which means that
something minor went wrong during
execution and
a lot of times you just don't pay
attention to it
a warning is a critical error now it is
given in condition where suppose an
include function
that we just discussed in the previous
question
then to retrieve a non-existent file so
suppose you use an include function and
the file does not exist it will display
a warning and final is a fatal error so
it is a critical error resulting in
termination of the code so as we discuss
in the try and catch part of the
question
if an exception is thrown and we do not
have a catch function for it it will
display a fatal error which will return
in termination of the code
next question
how to call a function by a reference
so
ampersand sign is used to call a
function by reference now in case of
reference the actual value is modified
if the value passed inside the function
is also modified by in case of value the
value of the original value does not
change
so this piece of code here
is
an example of how you can call a
function by reference here as you can
see this ampersand sign
will call this function by reference and
any changes made in the variables here
will affect the original ones next
question
create a singleton class in php so how
do we create a singleton class in ph
before that let's have a look at what is
a singleton class now a singleton class
in php is a class that can have only one
object and hence provides only a single
point of access so in generally
generally in class you can create as
many objects as you want and it will in
turn create
different access points into that block
of code
so in a singleton class you can only
create a single object hence
singleton so this piece of code as you
can notice is used to create a singleton
class
now in to create a singleton class
you need to have the constructor
function private
now here
as you can see a singleton class is
created using this private construct
and it then
checks
if there's only one instance created and
if it is
it functions properly and displays
initialize only once
next question
how to encrypt a password using php so
php
can be used for encryption techniques
now the password underscore hash
function creates a hash password from
the password string using hashing
algorithm so suppose
you create a password string and enter
your password as password one two three
and you put it inside the password has
hash function
so what it will generate is we are
echoing this generated hash
so what it will generate is
this so this is the
this is random it changes every time you
generate the password since it is
encrypted and
same when you pass
this password to the database using
hashing algorithm even in the database
the password will not be visible so your
data is secure
next question
mention different sorting functions for
errors in php now let us understand this
question in the vs code so php consists
of different sorting functions which you
can use to sort and give an array
automatically so if you want to sort an
array in ascending order what you need
to do is use this sort function so it
will sort this array in ascending order
now if you want to sort it in descending
order
use our sort that is reverse sort
similarly suppose you want to
sort an array in terms of value in
ascending order so you need to use a
sort function that is this
so in terms of value what in terms of
value means is suppose in a given error
there are keys and values so it will
sort the array based on the values that
is this 22 27 and 37 so the array will
be the same since
the values are already sorted
now if you want to sort the array in
according to key that is this
you can use ksor that is keysort
function that is provided in php so in
case of key sort
what it does is it will sort the array
in key that is the first one would be d
that is duke second m mac and the third
are that is raw
now
if you want to sort
this
error
in descending order in terms of value
you use instead of a sort you use a
reverse sort similarly if you want to
sort an array in terms of key
in descending
you use k instead of k sort k r sort
that is k reverse sort so these are the
different sorting functions that are
inbuilt into php
moving on
what will be the output of the following
code now
if this code is given
let me give you some time and try to
pause this video and think of what will
be the output of the following code
so the output of this code will be 21
comma 21 or 2 1 comma 2 1
how did it happen
but before that if you got it correct
congratulations
but if you want to understand it see
a is a variable that contains the value
1 while a b is a variable that is
getting the value of a variable through
reference now we make changes in the b
variable with 2
followed by this variable again which is
calling the value of a by reference so
if we make changes here we also make
changes in the value of a now if we
display this since the value of a is
already changed by reference it will
display 2 1 that is the value here and
again since the value of b is already 2
1 it will again display 2 1.
moving on
what are construct function and destruct
function in php so a constructor or
construct function is automatically
invoked when a new object of a class is
created and then can be used to
initialize value in class
so when you create a object
an object for a class a constructor
function is automatically invoked
but this can also be so it does not
contain any value when it is invoked but
you can also use this construct function
to initialize some properties to give
some properties to the class which will
act as its default properties if nothing
or
no new properties are given to the class
next is a destruct now a distract is
automatically invoked when an object of
a class is destructed suppose you end
the part of the code of a class you want
you are destroying the object when you
are ending the piece of code a destruct
function is automatically invoked to
clean up the resources
next
is how can php and javascript interact
now php and javascript can not directly
interact with each other since php is a
server-side scripting language while
javascript is a client-side language but
there is a way that these two
wonderful languages can interact with
each other so we can swap variables
since php can produce javascript code to
be implemented by the browser so yes you
can produce javascript code from php
which can then be implemented by a
browser and then it is probable to pass
those precise variables back to php
via a url next question is
explain type hinting in php
now in php type hinting is used to
specify the expected data type that is
array object interface etc for an
argument in a function declaration
now during a function call suppose if
arguments does not match the expected
data type the run time will display an
error and the probe that is a fatal
error and the program will then
terminate now in this code here what we
are doing is we are type hinting
so this is this code is for string type
hinting
and this code is for integer type
hinting now if these
particular set of functions that have
already specified the type they are
expecting does not
receive the same type of variable inside
them
the
program will return in a fatal error and
it will terminate
so
moving on to our final question of this
video
write a class so yes this is a an
assignment a kind of assignment for you
guys so what you need to do is you need
to write a class to solve the following
question which i'm going to say
so implement a class named basketball we
all like basketball right so implement a
class name basketball with an attribute
named baskets so you have to create an
attribute name basket and initialize it
to 0 as the starting position
and then
create a method name score now when the
score method is invoked the baskets must
increase by 1. so let's see the solution
now so this is how you create a class
that is basketball
now
inside this class what we are going to
do is we are going to initialize the
number of baskets that is this variable
as 0 as the starting position so to do
that what we are going to do is we will
be using construct function as we
discussed to initialize some
default properties for the class
so this construct function is
used to initialize this basket's
variable to 0. now suppose we do not
call this function score which is
increasing the number of baskets the
default value will be displayed as 0
every time now suppose we invoke this
core function every time a basket is
code
this will increase the number of baskets
by one
so this is pretty simple and this is how
you create a simple class which will
perform
the following question
sql is a very important technology that
is used in the id industry
professionals working as application
developers web developers data analysts
data scientists software testers and
cyber security experts need to know sql
in this video we will cover 30 important
sql questions that are most frequently
asked in the interviews
so before i begin make sure to subscribe
to the simply learn channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
now these questions consist of a set of
theoretical and practical questions
so we will use different commands
functions joints and other
functionalities in excel to solve the
problems
so let's get started with the first
question
so the first question is to state the
difference between where and having
clause in sql
now wear and having are very widely used
in sql to solve specific problems
now let's look at the difference one by
one
so where clause is used to filter the
records from the table based on the
specified condition and can be used
without the group by clause on the other
hand having clause is used to filter the
records from groups based on specified
conditions
now where clauses cannot have aggregate
functions so you cannot use sum count
average min and maximum functions in the
where clause
while in the having clause you can
operate on aggregate functions
and those aggregate functions are used
to filter values from a group
now where clause is implemented on rows
or at row
level so for each row of data you have
the where condition applied
now having clauses are implemented on
columns so for each column of data you
have the having condition applied
now another important difference between
wear and having is that the where clause
is executed before the execution of the
group by clause and after the execution
of the from clause
on the other hand the having clause is
executed after groups are created
now we will learn more about wear and
having and understand the usage better
when we tackle practical problems in
this video
now moving to our next question
which is
how is drop different from truncate
so drop and truncate are two different
commands
so drop command is used to drop the
whole table removing the table
definition and its contents while
truncate deletes all the rows from the
table
we can drop the whole table structure in
one go so the view of the table does not
exist
by using the truncate command the
existence of all the rows in the table
is lost but the view in the table exists
now integrity constraints
will be removed in drop command while
the integrity constraints will not be
removed when you use the truncate
command
now moving to our third question now
this is a practical question so we will
be using a table which is present in my
mysql database so the table name is
called employees and i want to find the
lowest salary of the employees in each
department
you can see here this is how my
employees table
looks
and
the output query would be something like
this
so here since i want to find the lowest
salary of the employees so i'm using a
min function to find the lowest salary
in the table
and then
i'm grouping
all the employees and the results by
department so let's do this on mysql
workbench
okay so here i am on my mysql workbench
first let me go ahead and create a new
sql script so i'll click on this
and that will create a new script
okay so here we'll write our commands
all right
so
our question was to
find the
lowest salary
for each department
okay so i have given my comment to make
my
commands
and whatever i am doing more readable
so
first before i proceed
i need to
select my database so i'm going to use
my sql underscore intro database
so i'll write use sql underscore intro
now this database has a lot of tables
that we'll be using in this
interview questions
video i'll run it
okay
we are in our sql intro database
now there is a table called
employees let me show you the table
first
if i write select star from employees
okay so here you can see this is the
table i'm talking about
now these are the
rows
that are present in the table we have 20
rows and here you can see the different
columns we have the employee id employee
name each gender
we have the department city and salary
now this is the same table that we have
also used
in our other videos that are already
live on youtube
okay
so
let's solve our question to find the
lowest salary for each department
now
for that
i'll write select
i'll select my department column which
is dept
comma
and then
to calculate the lowest salary or to
find the lowest salary i'm going to use
the min function so that will return the
minimum salary
present in the salary column
so i'll write min salary as i'm giving
an alias name as let's say
lowest
underscore salary
from
my table name that is
employees then i'll write
group by
department
i'm grouping it by department because we
want to find the lowest salary of the
employees in each department
now let's run and see the result
there you go
i'll just
move it to the top so that you can see
the results clearly
okay so here we have total seven
departments you can see at the bottom
and
in these seven departments you can see
in sales seventy thousand let's say
dollars was the lowest salary in
marketing we had fifty five thousand
dollars as the lowest salary similarly
if i scroll down we have other
departments like
tech i.t finance and hr so
these are the lowest salary
in each department
all right
now moving to our next question
so our fourth question is
which query will help you fetch unique
values from a column in a table
so this is a multiple choice question
which is another type of question that
is often asked in the sql interviews
now we have multiple queries here and
you need to choose the right query that
will solve our problem
so
since i want to
get the unique values from a column in a
table
so the right option
would be to use the distinct keyword in
the query so if i write select
dixtent followed by the column name
let's say you want to find the distinct
cities or the distinct departments in
the employees table so the query would
be select distinct city or let's say
department from the table name that is
employees
hence this is the right option if you
want to find any unique values from a
column
now moving to the
fifth question
now the fifth question says
it is actually a similar question here
we want to write the sql query to fetch
unique departments from the employees
table
so as we saw this is our employees table
and if you want to find the unique
departments from the employees table you
can just write select
distinct
then followed by the column name
which is departments here so dept from
employees
let's
do this
on our mysql workbench
okay so let me just scroll down
and i'll
give a comment here
that is we want to find the unique
departments
so the query would be
select
then i'll use the distinct keyword if i
hit tab it will auto complete
then
i have my column that is department
from
my table name that is employees
if i run this
the query will give us
the unique departments that are present
in the table so here we have total
seven unique departments in the table
you can see here we have sales marketing
product
tech id
finance and hr
but
if you see our original table which is
the employees table
so there are total
20 records
and if you see the department column
there are
multiple departments to which each of
these employees belong to
okay
now moving ahead
now the sixth question is to write an
sql query to fetch the unique values of
departments and print their length
now
this question consists of two parts
first we need to fetch the unique values
of departments that we saw in our fifth
question
and then we want to print the length of
each of the departments so for that i'm
using the different keyboard to find the
unique departments and then
i'm using the
inbuilt length function that is present
in mysql to find the length of the
department and then i am
using an alias that is length underscore
department from employees so let's say
this on
our workbench
okay
so let me
give a comment
i'll say
unique
departments and length
okay
so the query would be
i'll write
select
distinct
department
and then
let me just scroll down
i'll give a comma
and use my inbuilt length function see
i'm hitting tab to auto complete
and inside the length function i'll give
my column name that is department
i'll give an alias as
department underscore
length
from my table that is
employees this is pretty simple
so first i am finding the unique
departments and then using the length
function i am finding the
length of each department
let's run and see
okay you can see the result here so
sales the length is five
marketing the length of marketing is
nine so basically you're counting the
number of characters that are present in
each of the departments so in sales
there are total five characters in
marketing there are total nine
characters in product there are total
seven characters in it we have just two
letters i and t so hence the
length is two similarly finance is
seven and h r is two because we have
just two letters h and r okay so this is
another variation of using distinct
along with
any inbuilt function
all right
now moving to the seventh question
the question is what is the use of
datif function in sql
now dative
returns the number of days between two
date or date time or time stamp values
so d diff is another
crucial
inbuilt function
that is present in mysql
so here is how you can use the datedif
function so it will return the
number of days between two dates or date
time or time stamp values so here i have
two date values that is
10th of
april 2021 and
i have
30th of march 2021
so this query will give us the
total number of days that lie between
these two dates and similarly
here is another example of using the
datedif function
so i want to calculate the total number
of days that are present between today's
date so i am using the now function and
between
20th of april
2021 so let's do this demo on the
workbench
all right
first i'll give a comment
saying
d d function
okay
now the way to use this
i'll write select
and then
you can see here once i type date
mysql workbench is automatically
suggesting some of the
inbuilt functions i am going to use
datedif
and within datedif i am going to pass in
two values so i am passing in two date
values lets say 2021
april
so i'll write 0 4 and let's say
10th of april
i'll give another comma
and i'll pass in my second date value
that is going to be
30th of
march 2021
all right
now another thing to note here is
the
date value should be present inside
quotations
now if you want you can give an alias as
well
i'll write as
total these
let's run it
there you go it has given us the output
as 10 so there are total 10 d's between
31st of march
to
10th of april
now let's see another example
i'll write select
date diff
and we'll pass in
my now function so the now function
returns the
current
date that is today's
date
and i'll give another date value let's
say
2021
april 20th
now we'll see the results
if you want you can give an alias name
so that the output is more readable here
i'll run it
okay so between
today's date and
my previous date that was 20th of
april
there are total 49 days
so today's date is actually
8th of june so between
20th of april and 8th of june there are
total 49 days
all right
now moving ahead
now in the eighth question we want to
write
an sql query to display the departments
that have
more than two employees
so
this is our employees table that we have
been using and here is how the
command looks like so here
we are using both group by and having
now i am grouping by department because
i want to
display the departments that have more
than two employees now for the second
filter i am using the
count function of the employee ids
and checking if the employees
in each department are more than two or
not
let's do this
let me
move down a bit
and i'll give a comment
departments with
more than
two employees
okay
now let's write our query
so i want to select
the department
and then
i'm using the count function to count
the
employee ids in each department or the
employees
present in each department
from my table that is employees
i'm going to group by
department
and then i'll use having
my count of
employee id
this should be greater than 2.
so
our query will return only those
departments which have more than two
employees
let's run and see
there you go
so we have
total four departments that is sales
product tech and i t
where we have more than
two employees you can see here sales has
four employees product has three
tech has four
and it has three the rest of the
departments like finance hr and others
have less than two employees
now if you want you can give an alias as
well
let's see as
total employees
okay
let me run it again
and here you can see i have the
column name as total employees
okay
so moving ahead
the ninth question we want to display
the details of the employees for all the
departments except marketing
now
here i have my employees table
now if i were to display all the details
of the employees apart from
marketing department
i can give a condition like where
department
not equal to marketing so this is the
way how you write not equal to so you
use the less than and greater than
symbol
another way to do is use the exclamation
mark and give equal to so this means
select all the employees where
department is not equal to marketing
now let's do this
i'll move down a bit
and will give a
comment as
details of employees apart from
marketing
so the query would be select
star from employees
i am using star because i want to
display all the details that means i
want to display all the columns
then i am going to use my where
condition where
department not equal to
marketing
i'll put marketing under
quotes
let's run it and see the results
there you go
so
we have
total
18 rows of information
and if you see the department column we
have
all the departments apart from marketing
now if you remember
our employees table had total 20 rows of
information out of which two are missing
which means there were two employees who
were from marketing department and those
departments were
not displaying
now
another way to do is
to use
exclamation mark and equal to
so this also means select all the
employees where department is not equal
to marketing
let's run this you see here
it gives us the same result and has
returned us
18 rows of information
leaving apart
the employees from the marketing
department
all right
now moving ahead
so our tenth question is to write an sql
query to print the details of the
employees who have joined before
april 2010 and after
may 2005
so here is my employees table
and this is my sql query so here we are
using
just a where condition to filter our
results
and
my condition is
the employee should have joined after
may 2005 so i have written
after 31st of
may 2005 and before april 2010 which is
before
31st of march 2010
let's do this
i'll
give a comment here
we'll write
employees
joined
before
april
2010
[Music]
and
after
may 2005.
now let's write our sql query so i'll
write select
star from
employees
where
my date of join if you see here i have a
column called date of join which has the
details about the day on which the
employee had joined
the company
so i'm going to write where date of join
is greater than
31st of
may
2005 so i'll write
2005
this is one of the formats to use
date values
so this is the year value this is the
month value and this is the d value
and
my date of join
should be
less than
31st of march 2010 so i'll write
2010
march
31st
i hope
you were able to understand this
date of join greater than 31st of may
2005 means
after may 2005 and data joined less than
31st of march
2010 this means
employees joined before 2010 april
let's run it
okay so we have total three employees in
our table you can see the
date of join
and all of them have joined
after may 2005 and before april
2010 okay
now moving ahead to the 11th question
so here we want to find the employee
with the
third highest salary from the table
so i have my employees table here
and my command would look something like
this so here we are going to explore how
to write
sub queries in sql so
i am using a sub query here where i am
trying to find
the
employees who have the
top three salaries or the top three
employees who have the highest salaries
and from that i'm going to filter out my
third highest salary employee so let's
do it on our workbench
okay
so i'll come down and let me give a
comment as
third highest salary
okay
so
let me first write down my sql query and
then i'll explain so i'll write select
star from
after that i'll start a bracket and
write my inner query so i'll write
select
star
from employees
order by
salary
descending
then i'll use my limit keyword
and i'll write limit 3
as i'll give an alias name let's say t
and then
i'm
again going to use
my order by
salary
limit
one
okay now let me explain you the flow
so first let me run the inner query i'll
select my inner query
and i'll run it
so the inner query returns
my top three employees who have the
highest salary and this is ordered in
descending order since i used salary
descending
now let me just use this okay now you
can see it clearly so these are my top
three employees who have the highest
salary so josef has the
maximum salary followed by
angela and then we have jack now from
this i want to return
only
the record for jack because jack is the
employee
who earns the third highest salary
so for that
i am going to
use the result written by my
sub query or the inner query and on top
of this
i'm going to order the salary and say
limit equal to 1 so i'm again ordering
this salary in ascending order so what
will happen jack will appear at the top
angela will be at the second place and
joseph will come to the third place and
from there i am using limit1 so that i
can only get
the record for jack
now if i run the entire query you see
the result i have my
employee name as jack who wants the
third highest salary
okay
now moving ahead to the 12th question
the question is to print all the
alternate records in a table
so here is my employees table and from
this table i am going to print all the
alternate records for example i am going
to print the my employee id101 then i am
going to skip 102 and print one zero
three followed by one zero five one zero
seven one zero nine so all the
employee ids that have an odd value
and you can look at this example in
another way of displaying the employees
which have an employee id
of even numbers so 102 104 106 and so on
now the way to do is
either you can use a simple select
clause and say employee id
percentage or modulus 2 equal to 0 which
means i want to filter only those
employees which have an even employee id
else
what you can do is you can use a cte as
you can see here
so cte or the common table expression is
a temporary named result set that you
can reference within a select insert
update or delete statement now it is
used to
simplify complex joins and sub queries
and to provide a means to query
hierarchical data
now let's
write this query on our workbench and
see how it works
before that let me explain you i am
using a few
new functions such as row number this
will
create a row number for each of the rows
or the records present in my table
and then
from this cte i am going to use my
filter class or the where clause
where rn which is row number percentage
2 equal to equal to 1 so this will
return
only the odd records from the table
let's see how to do it
okay
so
i'll give a comment
print
alternate
records
okay
now i'll start with my
simple query which is select star from
employees
where
let's say i want to find only the even
employee ids
or the employees who have an even
employee id so i can use employee id
percentage 2 equal to 0 so it has to be
a perfect division
and the result should be 0 only then i
can get only the
even employees if i run this
okay there was an error here it should
be employees
i'll run it again
you can see here i have printed the
alternate records in a table so we have
skipped 101 because it is not divisible
by two
i've started with one zero two followed
by one zero four one zero six one zero
eight
and then finally we have
one two zero or hundred and twenty
now if you want
to print only the
odd records in the table you can use
employee id percentage 2 equal to 1 so
you can see here i have 1 0 1 1 0 3 1 0
5 107 up to 119
now the
best way to do this is
to use a common table expression or cte
so i'll start with
my command that is with cte
as
i'll
start with my bracket i'll write select
star
comma
then i'm going to use my row number
function
so i'll write row number
then
i'll write over
then i'll use order by
employee id
so this
row number for each of the rows is going
to be created over my employee id column
and that is sorted in
ascending order i will give an alias as
rn which stands for row number
from
my table that is
employees
i'll scroll down
and then i'm going to
close my bracket
i'll write select
let me remove the space here
okay and let's select
star from
cte
where
my
row number
percentage
2 equal to
1.
now
let's
see this from the top
so i have my commentable expression
where
i am
going to create a
row number column named as rn
and this row number column is based on
my employee id column which is sorted in
ascending order
and from that
i am going to filter only those row
number values that are not divisible by
2
or i am going to print only the
odd records from the table so lets run
it and see the results there you go so
here if you mark i have my row number
column created
and i am filtering only the odd records
in the table so it starts with 1 3 5 7
and goes up to 19
and similarly here you can see the
employee ids the name the age gender and
other information
now if you were to print
the even records in the table
the alternate even records you can use
rn percentage 2 equal to 0. let's see
the difference
and run this
there you go
so i have my even row numbers starting
from 2 which goes up to
20. okay so this is how
you can print alternate records in a
table
now moving to the next question
now in the 13th question we want to
write an sql query to fetch
all the duplicate rows in a table now
this is another crucial interview
question that is often asked in most of
the interviews
now i have a table
which is named as duplicate table and
here you can see i have some employee id
name and each and a few records are
duplicated for example
101 sam
40 the first record is duplicated and
you can see here it has the same
values
now if you mark
1 0 3
mary and 28 is not duplicated because
here the age is different so this is a
different person
than
compared to the third
name that we have
so this is how you can find
the duplicate rules in a table so i am
going to select my employee id name and
age and then count
all the
employee ids the names and each and
compare them with whether they are
greater than one or not so if they are
greater than one
then
i'll say that particular record is
duplicated or is present more than one
time in the table
let's
do this
implementation on our
workbench
okay
so i'll come down
and let me give my comment as
duplicate records
okay
so
let me first
show you the records that are present in
my table so i'll right select
start from
dup underscore
employees
run it
okay you can see here i have my table
that we saw in the slides
so
employee id 101 with name sam and age
40 is duplicated
so we want to find this duplicate record
the way to do is
i'll write
select
e underscore id which is employee id
comma name comma age
comma i'm going to count all of them
so i'll write count star
as
duplicate
count this is my alias name
from my table that is dup underscore
employees
i'll say
group by
employee id
name
and age
and then i am going to use my having
clause saying having
count of
employee id
is greater than 1
and
count of
name
should also be greater than 1
and
my count of age
should also be
greater than 1
let's run it and see the results
okay there is some error here
the name of the table should be
employees
okay
let's run again
we have our correct result
that is employee 101 with name sam and
each 40 is duplicated so the value is 2.
great
now
moving ahead
now the 14th question is a bit tricky
but in we want to display the employees
with exactly
two
a's in their name
so you see here i have my
employ names and
there are certain employees who have
just
two e's in their names so i want to find
those employees
only
now the way to do is
it is a bit tricky to understand i am
going to break it down and make you
understand
on my mysql workbench
so here you can just have a glance i
write select star from employees where
i am finding the length of my employee
name and then subtracting
my length
wherein i have
replaced my employee name that has a
with a
blank
and if this subtraction is equal to 2
then
that particular employee has two a's in
their names
so let me show this first
let me
first give my comment as
employees with
two
e's okay
so
first
i'm going to write a select statement
ok before that i will show you
the records present in my table
ok
if you see here
shane is one of the employees that has
just one e
in its name then we have mary 1a
duen has one a but if you see sarah
sarah has
2a
in the name so we want to extract sarah
then
jack has one a again if you see angela
angela has 2a it doesn't matter if it is
uppercase a or lowercase a we just need
to find
if the employees have two e's in their
name
and similarly if i scroll down let me
check if we have
any other employee with two a's in their
name marcus has one david has one sophia
has one
we also have amelia that has two a's
in its name or in her name
and we also have maya
okay
now
let me go ahead and write a sql query
and then i'll explain you what i'm
trying to do
i'll write select
i'm using the length function
and
in the length function
i'm going to replace
then i'll use another function called
upper
on top of employee name
i'll write
a
and then replace it with a blank so i'm
using quotations to represent blank
from
employees
okay
let's run this and see the results
you see here
it has given us
the length
of the employee strings after
replacing all the a's with a blank
so here
i'm essentially
converting my employee names to upper
case
and i'm changing wherever there is an a
i'm replacing
that a with a blank
and then i'm finding the length
so this trick i'm going to use
in my
final query so i'll write select star
from
employees
where
what i'm going to do is
i'll bring this to the next line i'll
write
length of
employee name
minus
then i'm going to use my above
condition
i'll
copy this
i'll paste it here
and this value should be
2.
so what i am doing is i am first
finding out the length of my employee
name
from that
i am subtracting
the length after replacing
the e is present in the employee name
with a blank and this value should be
equal to 2. the reason being we are only
trying to find the employees who have
two a's in their name
let's run and see the results
okay if you see here
we have sara angela
emilia and maya who have
two a's in their name so we have
sarah
that has 2a angela has 2a amelia has two
a's
and then maya also has 2a
okay
now moving ahead
now the 15th question is given a string
how will you extract four characters
starting from the
second position
so i have my string here
which says michael ballack now michael
ballack you must be aware he is a
popular footballer he is from germany
and also was the captain of germany
so from the string michael balak i am
going to extract four characters
starting from the second position
you can use two inbuilt mysql functions
to
do this the first is called sub str
wherein we pass in the string
then we
give the position from where we want to
extract the characters so here i am
going to extract from the second
position so hence 2
and then the number of characters that
you want to extract which is 4.
the other way is to use the substring
function
which is again similar to the sub str
function
in the substring function also i am
first passing in my input string and
then giving my
starting position which is 2 and then i
want to extract 4 characters from it
let's do it
i'll give a comment
extract
strings
so here i'm going to write select
first i'm going to use sub str
which is my inbuilt function
i'm going to pass in my input string
which says
michael
ballack
and then
i'll give my starting position which is
2 and then the number of characters that
is 4.
let's run it and see the results
you can see here it has given us i cha
so if you see m is at the first position
from the second position onwards i
needed four characters so m c h and e
these are the four characters starting
from the second position
similarly let me just copy this
and instead of
sub str i'm going to use the sub string
function i'll write just
ing that becomes substring
let's
select and run it
and this also returns the same result
suppose you wanted to extract
from the fourth position
you wanted to extract let's say three
characters
let's see the results
it gives us h a and e if you see here
m is the first physician i is at the
second position c is at the third
position
h starts from the fourth position
so h a and e are the next three
characters starting from the fourth
position so hence this is the result
all right now moving ahead
now my sixteenth question is on how does
self join
work
so self join joins a table to itself
so the table must contain a column x
that acts as the primary key and a
different column let's say y that stores
values that can be matched up with the
values in column x now
this might
not be really easy to understand you'll
get to know once we do this demo so i
have a table
which is called employee manager so this
is my table
now let me tell you how to interpret
this table we have five different
employees starting from employee id one
to employee id five
gary gibbs smith latham and
jimmy are the different employees we
have we have their salaries and now you
have
the employees reporting to which manager
now if you see here
gary's manager
id is 3
so if you see a table at 3 we have smith
so gary is reporting to 3
or in other words
smith has a employee under him who is
gary similarly
gibbs is reporting to manager id1 or
employee one which is gary so
gibbs manager is gary similarly if you
see for smith smith is reporting to the
person with manager id 4 or employee id
4 we have latham so litham has one
employee under him who is smith
now litham in our table has no managers
then we have jimmy who's reporting to
the employee id3 who is smith
okay
now i want to
use this table and return the name of
the manager for each employee
to do that i am going to use my self
join so here i am using
a self join to join both the tables
here both the tables mean i am using
the same table twice so i have written
select e dot employee id e dot employee
name then we have e dot manager id then
i am using another alias for managers so
m dot employee name as
manager underscore name from
employee underscore manager as e
this join means self join employee
underscore manager sm on
e dot manager id equal to e dot employee
id so this is my common column that is
employee id and manager id let's do it
all right
i'll give a comment here saying self
join
and i'll start with myself join i'll
write
select
let me first display my table i'll write
select star from
and my table name is emp underscore
manager
i'll run it
you can see the table here this is the
same table that we saw
in the slides
now i'll write my
join query i'll write select e dot
employee id
comma
e
dot
employee name
comma
e dot
manager id
comma
then i'm using another alias as m
for
finding the
manager name so m dot employee name as
manager name
there shouldn't be any space in the
alias name
then i'll write from
emp underscore
manager as e
join
emp underscore
manager as
m on
e dot
manager
underscore
id equal to
m dot
emp underscore
id
let me run this and we'll see the
results
there you go
so gary
reports to
the manager id 3 so from the table 3
is for smith so gary's manager is smith
gibbs manager is gary
smith's manager is litham and jimmy's
manager is smith
okay so this is how you can use self
join
now moving ahead with our
next question
so the 17th question
is on which of the following is called a
virtual table in sql so again we have a
multiple choice question
so the answer is
view you can see here
so view is a virtual table that has rows
and columns as they are in a real table
in the database now we can create a view
by selecting fields from one or more
tables present in the database
next moving to the 18th question
so here we want to write an sql query to
fetch the list of employees with the
same salary
again i am going to use a self join here
wherein i'll join the same employees
table
and this is how my
query would look like so i am
selecting distinct employee id so e dot
employee id e dot employee name e dot
salary from employees
then i'm joining
employees as e on employees e1 where e
dot salary equal to e1 dot salary
because i want to fetch the list of
employees with the same salary and i'm
ensuring that the employee ids from both
the tables are different
let's do it
i'll give a
comment here and write
employees
with
same salary
and i'll start with my
query i'll write select
extinct
e dot
employee id
comma
i'll write e dot
employee name
comm i dot salary
from
employees
as e
then
employs as
e1
where
e dot salary equal to
e1 dot
salary
and
e dot
employee id is not equal to
e1 dot
employee id
i'll give a semicolon and let's print
the results
you see here we have
emilia
bela
sheen and sara who have the
same salaries so emilia and sheen have
the same salary of 55 thousand dollars
bill and sarah have the same salary of
72 000
okay
now moving to the 19th question
so the question is to write an sql query
to print one row twice
in results from a table so i have a
table here called employees and i want
to print
one row twice in the results
so to solve such kind of problems
you need to use the union all operator
in sql
so union all combines the result sets of
two or more select statements
it does not remove duplicate rows
between the various select statements
all the rows are returned
so let's say i want to print the
employee name and department for those
employees who are from the hr department
now to do this we can use the union all
operator you can see it here so i am
selecting my employee name the
department from my table employees as e
then i am giving my where clause where e
dot department equal to hr
and then i'm using the union all
operator
then i'm again selecting my employee
name department from employees with
another alias as e1 where e1 dot
department equal to
hr
so let's do this
okay
so i'll give my comment as
print
row
twice
okay
now
i'll start with my query i'll write
select
my employee name
comma the department
from
my table that is employees as e
then i'll use where
e dot department equal to
hr
then i'm going to use the union all
operator
so the union all will combine the result
set of two or more select statements
then i'm going to write select
emp underscore name
comma
my department
from
employees
as
e1
where
e 1 dot department
equal to
hr
i'll give a semicolon now let's run it
there you go you can see here
marcus and sophia are from the hr
department and we have printed them
twice in our results
coming to the next question
the question is
using the num table
write a query to add 10 when number is 0
20 the number is 1
else
print the number itself
so you can see here i have my table
called num and it has just one column
which is
num id or number id
we have some
numbers here
and
from these numbers i want to add 10 if
the number is 0 20 if the number is 1
else i would print the number itself
so
to answer this question we'll use the
case statement in sql
so the case statement is sql's way of
handling if then logic
the case statement is followed by at
least one pair of when and then
statements
so here you can see i have my case
statement i am writing one case
my column name
and underscore id equal to 0 then add
plus 10
if it is 1 then add plus 20
else
we'll just return the number id
now let's do this okay
i'll give a
comment saying using
case statements
okay first of all
let me
display the values present
in my
num table you can see here this is my
table and there are total
12 rows
of numbers
now let's start with our
query i'll write
select
n underscore id
comma
then i'm going to write my case
statement so i'll use the keyword as
case
when n underscore id equal to 0
i'll use then
n underscore id
plus 10
i'll write when
n underscore id equal to 1
then
n underscore id
plus 20
else
i'll just print an id
now i'll end my key statement i'll write
end as
an alias name let's say num underscore
add
from my table that is
num
let's run and see the results
okay you can see here
my first
number was 0 so since it was 0 we have
added
num id or n id plus 10 so the result is
10
now
wherever
the num id is 1 for example here we have
added 20 so the
result or the output becomes 21.
similarly here the value was zero so we
have added 10 the output is 10
and you see here again here we had
another one so we added 1 to
20 so the result becomes 21
and for the rest of the numbers for
example 3
we had 2
the values are the same
okay
now moving ahead
so we have
a table called num1
and using this table
we want to write a query to find the sum
of all positive values and the negative
values
so let's see the table first so this is
my table which is num1 you can see here
we have a list of integers and
there are positive as well as negative
integers
so for positive values
and the negative values we want to find
the sum separately
so again for this we are using the
case statement you can see here i have
used
two key statements
i'm writing select
and then i'm using the case to find if
the number is greater than 0 which means
it's a positive number so i am finding
out the sum and then i am checking
case when
the integer is less than zero so it's a
negative number and i'm finding the sum
for the negative numbers as well
let's do this
okay
so
i'll give my comment
as
add
positive and
negative numbers
okay so let's start with our select
query
i'll write select
i'll use the sum function and inside the
sum function i'll use my case statement
so i'll write case when
num
underscore
integer
okay before that let me just print the
values present in my
table so i'll write select star from
my table name that is num1
okay
so you can see here these are the values
of the list of integers that we have
there are some positive as well as
negative integers
okay let's continue with our query
so here i'm going to write case when
num underscore integer or int which is
my column name
if it is greater than 0
then
i'll return norm underscore
int
else i'll say 0
and end my case statement
i'll give an alias as sum of let's say
positive numbers
give a comma
then i'll use another sum function
and inside the sum function we'll use
the case statement to find
the sum of
negative numbers or integers
so i'll write num underscoring if it is
less than 0
then
num underscore end
else
0
and i'll end
ok
and i'll give another alias name as
let's say sum underscore any g which
stands for negative
pos is for positive integers
and then i'll write from my table that
is num1
let's
run it
okay there you go we have our results so
we have two columns
sum of positive integers and sum of
negative integers you can see the
results 19 and minus 14 respectively
okay now moving ahead
now
in question number 22 we want to list
the difference between
primary key and foreign key
so as you can see here
primary key is something that can
uniquely identify a record in a table
so if you consider a school database a
primary key would ideally be
the
role number or the registration number
of the student
because that is unique to all the
students in a school
now
foreign key is the field in the table
that is
primary key to another table
so suppose you have another table called
courses to which the
students have enrolled to
now
if you have a role number or a
registration number column in the
course table that becomes the
foreign key
now the other difference is primary key
don't accept or cannot accept null
values
while foreign key can accept null values
you can have only one primary key in a
table but you can have more than
one foreign key in a table
now coming to the 23rd question
what is the difference between primary
key and union
so you can have only one primary key in
a table as we discussed in the previous
question
but you can have more than one unique
key in a table a primary key column
cannot have null values but
union can accept null values
now if you assign a column as a primary
key you create a clustered index
and similarly if you assign a column
with union you create non-cluster index
ok
now coming to the 24th question
what is a check constant in sql
so check constraints are used while
creating tables
check constraint
helps to limit or restrict the values
that can be inserted into a column
for example
we have a
table here
let's say dummy one and
you want to ensure
that every time you insert the
age of
people or persons in the table you want
to make sure that each should be always
greater than zero reason being a person
cannot have or an animal cannot have or
a tree cannot have a negative each
similarly you can set a constant for the
salary column in a table to ensure that
it is always greater than zero because
you cannot earn a negative salary or it
cannot be less than 0.
now we are going to create a dummy table
on my mysql workbench and see how
check constraints can be applied
okay
so let's give our comment as
check constraints
all right
so
i'm going to create
a table
called
dummy
let's say underscore
sql
now this table
will have
a few columns first we have let's say
eid which stands for employee id
the data type is integer and
i'm going to assign employee id as my
primary key so i'll write
primary key here
okay
i'll give a comma
next we'll have a
city column
city column is of type var care or
varying character
i'll give the size as 30
and here
i am going to apply my check constraint
to this
city column
i am going to check
the city
should
take only
values as mumbai
let's see
i'll have my final column that is each
ages of type integer
and here i'm going to check my age
should always be
greater than zero so i'll write check
age
greater than zero
okay
so our dummy sql table has
one primary key constraint and we have
applied two check constraints
on city and each column
let's run this
okay so we have created our table
successfully you can see it here
now
let's insert a few records and we can
see the difference
i'll write insert into
dummy
underscore sql
i'll write
values
i'll have my employee ids 101
i'm giving
my city as mumbai
which is what we want
and let's see
i'll give my age as
10
now this should perfectly work because
my city is mumbai and my age
is greater than zero
so
i should be able to insert this record
successfully you can see here
i have inserted
this record to the table
i'll write select star from dummy sql so
that you can check
let's run it
there is some mistake i should write
from okay
let's run it
you can see it here we have one record
or one row returned
now let's see we'll insert another
record
and this time i'm going to give my
employee ideas 102 because it has to be
unique
and this time instead of mumbai i'm
going to give my city as let's say delhi
so i'm not following my check constant
where i am
supposed to give only mumbai
i am purposely giving
delhi here to see the difference if i
run this
let's see we'll have
ages 40 which is greater than
0
let's run it
you see here we get an error saying
check constraint dummy underscore sql
underscore
check
is violated
similarly
let's see i'll change this to mumbai
again
and instead of 40 let's say i'll give us
minus 30
so your each can never be in negative
numbers
if i run this i get the same error my
check constraint has been violated
because each
should be greater than
zero
okay so this is how you can use check
constraints in sql
now coming to the 25th question
so given two tables a and b
you want to write a query to fetch
values in table b
that are not present in table a
now to answer this question
you can use the left join
so what left join does is
it returns all the rows from the left
table and only matching rows from the
right table
and i've used my
condition as a dot id which is in the
right table should be null
let's write this query on the
workbench
okay
so i'll give my comment
using
left join
first of all let me display my
tables i'll write select star from
e
where on this i have the ids there are
total five ids in table a similarly
i'll copy this and
we'll see the values that are present in
table b
so again i have five values there are a
few non-matching values as well so i
want to return those non-matching values
that are not present in table a
so for that
i'll write select
id
from table b
i'll use left join
a
using my id column
this is another way to give the
condition
or you can use the on operator
then i'll give
bear
a dot id is
null
let's run and see the results
there you go so 150
275 are not present in table a but are
present in table b
okay
now moving ahead
so now we look at the last set of five
questions
so these questions are based on the
popular northwind sample database
provided by microsoft now there are
several tables in this database so we
have an order table customers employee
products region table and others
we'll use our microsoft sql server to
solve the five questions
so my next question which is based on
microsoft sql server
the question is using the
north wind
database find the customers who don't
have any orders
okay so i am on my microsoft sql server
management studio so this is how the
interface looks like
and here you can see i have a list of
databases now to solve the last five
questions i am going to use the
northwind database if i expand this
i'll click on the plus sign you can see
there are a lot of tables that are
already present in the
database you can see here we have
customers employees employee directories
order details orders products
region shippers suppliers territories
and more
okay
let me just collapse this
all right
so
to write my queries i am going to create
a
new query file
and here you see
i am currently on my master database i
am going to change this to
northwind database so that we can
utilize all the tables that are present
so my 26th question was to find the
customers who don't have any orders
so for that
i am going to use two tables
customers and orders
so
let me first give a comment
saying
customers
with
no orders
and now
let's go ahead and display the columns
that we have and see the
records present in the tables
customers and orders so first time
checking all the
columns and the rows present in the
customers table
i'll
execute using this button or you can hit
f5 as well
okay you can see here there are total
91 customers these are all unique
customers you have total 91 unique
customer ids
you see here the company name of the
customer
you have the contact name the contact
title address city to which the
customers belong to
then the region postal code country
phone fax number
okay
now let me just copy this query
and
now we'll check for the orders table
i'll write select star from orders
and let's execute it or run it
okay so there are
total
830
rows of information so there were total
830 orders or order ids we have the
customer id now this customer id is
actually the
foreign key
for the orders table
but for the customers table customer id
is the
primary key and in the orders table
order id is the primary key
we also have the employee id again this
employee id is the foreign key for this
audits table
we have the order date
we have the required date ship date
ship wire which means
by which medium the order was shipped we
have the free charges ship name and
ship address as well
then you have the
city from which the item was shipped the
region postal code and the country
okay
now
let me use the distinct keyword i'll
write select
dextent
i want to find the distinct
customer ids from
my customers table
let's run and see how many unique
customer ids we have so there are total
91 customer ids or customers
now let's check for the orders table
let's run it and see the difference now
if you see here there are total
89
customer ids in the orders table which
means
there are two customers missing from the
orders table
and that implies those two customers
don't have any orders
so to
get the result i will use two different
queries
to derive at the same
output
so i am going to select
my customer id
from
my table that is
customers
i'm going to use
where
my customer id
and then i'm going to use the not in
operator
i'm going to use a sub query
select
customer id
from
my orders table
close the bracket and i'll give a
semicolon
now what this query essentially does is
it is first going to
find all the customer ids that are
present in my orders table
and
in the outer query we are only going to
return
the customers that are present in
both the tables
and
we are going to
exclude those customers which are not
present in the
orders table
so let's run and see the results we
should get two customer ids there you go
so these are the two customer ids which
are
present in the
customers table and are not present in
the orders table meaning that they don't
have any
orders in their name
now there is another way to do it
that is to use the not exist operator
wherein you can write another sub query
to get the same result we'll leave that
to you you can try this out using the
not exist operator as well
coming to the 27th question
using the orders table in the northwind
database we want to find all the
month and orders
so such problems you will face while
dealing with sales data so very often
sales executives would try hard to meet
their month and targets we want to
display all the orders made on the last
day of the month so let's solve this
question on our microsoft sql server
okay so let me first give my
comment for the 27th question
so the question is to
find all the month month-end orders so
i'll just write
month and orders
okay
now to get the month end orders we are
going to use a
built-in
eo month function which stands for end
of month
so let's start with the query
i'll write select
we are going to select the
employee
id
comma
i also want the order id
and
we want the order date
from
my table that is
orders
i'll
then give my where clause i'll write
where
my
order date
equal to
and i'll use my
inbuilt function that is end of month
i
have hit tab to autocomplete
and inside this function i will pass in
my order date column
then i am going to
use the order by clause i'm going to
order it by
employee id and the order id
i'll just move down and hit tab okay
let's
run the query there you go
we have got 26 rows of information
you see on the left side we have the
employee ids the order ids and then we
have the order date column now if you
mark the values present in the order
date column these are all
the
end of
month date values you see this is 28th
of feb
then we have
31st of
july we have 30th of june
so on and so forth
so these are the list of all the orders
that were placed
on the last day of the month
coming to the 28th question
we want to find the top 5 countries with
the highest freight charges in the year
1997.
so freight charge is the amount paid to
a carrier company for the transportation
of goods from origin to another location
the freight charge is calculated based
on the mode of transportation and the
distance between the pickup place or the
pickup location and the destination
so let's try this out on the
microsoft server management studio
okay so let me go ahead and
give my
comment
so since we want to find the top five
countries with the highest freight
charges
i'll just give my comment as
highest
freight charges
okay
now
to solve this
question i'll just change this to
ghd okay
we are going to use
our
orders table
so the way to do is i'll write select
i'm going to use the top 5 so top is
another
keyword or
an operator
so i'm going to find out the
ship country
and
then i'll calculate the average freight
prices so i'm going to use the average
inbuilt function
on top of my
column that is
freight
i'll give an alias as
let's say
average
fret
there should be no space i'll give a
underscore
i'll write from my table that is
orders
i'll use my where clause where
and then i'm going to find the year
from my order
column and this year should be 1997.
i'm going to
group it by
my ship country
and i'll use
order by
my alias name that was average freight
and in descending order i'm going to
sort it
let's see the top five
shipping countries who have the highest
freight charges
these are the results you have austria
switzerland sweden canada and ireland
and here you can see the average freight
prices
sorted in descending order
okay
now moving ahead to the
29th question
so here we want to display the total
number of products in each category so
we have two different tables products
and categories so both these tables we
are going to use
to find a solution to this problem that
is
to display the total number of products
in each category
so first let me give my comment to
display the total number of products in
each category i'll just write print
total
products
okay
so
to solve this problem we are going to
use our two tables
so let me first display the rows and
columns from both the tables the first
table is products
okay it is products
let's run this and see the columns that
we have in this table
okay so you have the product id which is
the primary key you have the product
name so there are total
77 different products okay
and then you have the supplier id you
have the category id so these two
columns are the foreign key columns you
have the quantity per unit unit price
units in stock units in order
and if you want to
reorder
some product to fill in the stocks so
you have information for that as well
and if the product has been discontinued
or not
i'll copy this and let's see what
rows and columns we have
in my categories table
okay
let me execute this
okay
so we have total eight categories of
products you can see beverages we have
dairy products
meat or poultry you have produce seafood
these are the description
okay
now to find the total number of products
in each category
i'll write my query as
select
i'll write
category
name
comma
count star
i'll give this an alias name as total
products
give an underscore and write products
from
my first table that is
products
given alias as p
i am going to use an inner join
with
my categories table
and i'll give my alias as c
on my common key column that is p dot
category id
is equal to
c dot
category id
then
i'm going to
group my results
based on the category names
so i'll write category
name and we'll use the
order by clause i'll write order by
count star
as
descending
so let's see the total number of
products that we have in each category
so this shouldn't be as descending
should be just count star descending
okay
i'll select and run it
there you go
so here on the left hand side you have
the different category names and
on the right you have the
total number of
products that belong to
each of the categories
all right
now moving on to the final question
so the last question is to use the
northwind database
and using this database we want to find
the list of late orders for all the
employees
so this is a real world problem that
often occurs
so the shipment of your orders might get
delayed due to logistic issues or if the
products are not available on time there
can be various other reasons as well so
here we want to find those orders for
the employees
where the required date is less than the
shipment date
we are going to use two different tables
that is
orders and employees
okay now let me give my comment for the
final
query that we are going to write in this
interview questions tutorial
so using the orders table i want to find
the list of orders for all the employees
so i'll just give list
of
late orders not just orders for
employees i write emp
s which stands for employees
so here i am going to use two tables
orders and employees
orders table we have already seen let's
see the rows and columns that are
present in the employees table
i'll write select star from employees
and let me run it
okay so there are total nine employees
we have
so we have the employee id this is the
primary key column which goes from one
to nine we have the last name of the
employee the first name of the employee
we have the title
then we have the
title of courtesy by the doctor
mr mrs
we have the birthday of the employee the
higher date or the date of join
you have the address city region postal
code and other information
all right
so let's
see how you can join the orders table
and the employees table to get the list
of late orders and we must remember that
late orders are those
where the required date is less than
equal to the shipped date
so i'll start with select
e dot
i'll write employee id
comma
i want the
first name
comma
i'm going to count
star as
late orders
from
my table orders as o
then i'll use my inner join
i'll write
employees
as
e
it doesn't matter actually if you use
small e or capital e
then i'm going to use my on condition on
e dot
on
e dot
employee id
equal to
o dot employee id
so this is my common key column that is
present in both the tables
then i'll use my where clause where
you should be careful
and you should keep the right
clause so my required date
should be less than or equal to my
shift date
so this is my condition
and then i am going to group by
e dot employee id
comma
e dot
first name
and then i'll use my order by clause
order by
my alias name that was late orders
and i'll arrange it in descending order
so let's run this and see our result
okay
so
you have the employee ids on the left
then you have the first name of the
employee ids and then you have the late
orders for each of these employees so if
you see here employee id 4 has the
highest number of late orders followed
by employee id
3 and 8
as well as 9 who have 5 late orders then
we have the employee id 2 which has
four late orders even employed is seven
has four lead orders employed five that
is steven has only one late orders
so we are done with our
demo section and we have covered all our
30 questions out of which 25 questions
were based and used on mysql server
and to address the last five questions
we used our northwind database that had
a lot of tables you can see it here and
using those tables we solve some
interesting questions

welcome everyone to this topic in which
we are going to talk about that what
exactly is the different maven interview
questions here now in this one we are
going to talk about what are the
different questions some couple of
questions we are going to go through and
we'll try to understand that what
exactly the answers are
now uh let's talk about the first
question over here so what exactly is in
maven here so maven is nothing but a
kind of a popular open tool uh open
source build tool which is available
there now before maven there were a
couple of build tools which was present
like and and you know a lot of other
legacy tools was present there but
after that maven is something which was
uh released as an open source tool and
it really helps the organization to
automate some couple of build processes
and you know have some particular
mechanisms like build publish and deploy
of different different projects at once
itself so it's a very powerful tool
which can really help us to do the build
automations we can integrate them with
the other tools like jenkins and you
know we can automate them we can
schedule the builds so a lot of various
advantages we can get with the help of
this tool here it's primarily written in
java and it can be used to build up
various other kind of projects also like
c sharp scalar ruby etc so all these
other typical tools can also be built up
with the help of this tool so this tool
is primarily
used to do the particular development
and management of the artifacts in the
java based projects so uh for most of
the java based projects nowadays this is
the default tool and it's already
integrated with the eclipse also so when
you go for a new wavelength project
automatically uh it will be created for
a java project you can use it for other
languages also but yes
default choice of java of of the java
programming language is maven build tool
only
now let's talk about next question so
what does the maven help with so maven
apache maven helps to manage all the
processes such as build process
documentation release process
distribution deployment preparing the
artifact so all these tasks is being
primarily taken care by the apache maven
so this tool simplifies the process of
project building it also increases the
performance of the project and the
overall building process so all these
things are something which is being
taken care by the specific maven tool
here
so it also uses the particular uh you
know it downloads the jar files of the
different dependencies for example if
you're source code is dependent on some
of the apache web server uh jar files or
some of the other third-party jar files
in that case you don't have to download
those jar files and keep in some
repository or keep it in some lib
directory you just have to mention that
dependency in the maven and that jar
file will be downloaded during the build
process and will be cached locally so
that's the biggest advantage which we
get with maven that you don't have to
take care of all these dependencies
anywhere into your source code system so
maven provides easy access to all the
required information it helps the
developer to build the projects and uh
without you know even worrying about the
dependencies processes or different
environments or different because it's
an uh kind of a tool which can be used
in any platform linux or windows so they
don't have to do any kind of conversions
so all they have to do is that they have
to just add new dependencies and that
should be updated into the pom file and
depending on that dependencies the
source code will be built up and they
don't have to refer any kind of third
party jar files so they don't have to
play with the class bars during the
build process so no customizations is
actually required with this one now the
next question is that what are the
different elements that may one take
cares of so there are different kind of
elements which is being taken care by
maven so
these particular parameters are elements
are bills
dependencies reports distribution
releases and mailing list so these are
the typical different different uh
elements which is being taken care by
the maven during the build process and
during the preparation of the builds
here so all these things you can uh they
can explore they can extract on that
part and they can fully understand that
how they can work on all these different
different processes now next question is
that what is the difference primary
difference between the and and maven
first of all both of them are primarily
used for the javascript so and is the
older version and maven is something
which was launched after the ad here so
and has no formal conventions like so
which can be uh you know coded into the
build.xml file there but yes the maven
has convention so information is not
required as such in the palm.xml file
there so ant is procedural whereas v1 is
declarative over here so and does not
have any kind of life cycle so it
depends on you that how you program the
and there but
maven is having a lot of life cycles
there which we can configure we can
utilize so the uh and related scripts
are not reusable because you cannot
reuse it and you have to do some kind of
customizations in order to work on that
but yes maven is not having much of the
project related any kind of dependencies
they can be easily reusable there
because there is nothing about the
palm.xml file it's just the artifact
name and the dependencies which is uh
something we can override or we can
change and then the same palm.xml file
we can reuse as such for the new project
also so that is where the reusability
comes into the picture now and is a very
specific build tool so we don't have to
there is no plugins as such which is
available there you just have to code
everything that what build process you
want to prepare
whereas in case of maven we have the
concept of plugins which can really help
us to understand that how we can make or
use of these plugins so that we can have
the reusability implemented so these are
some of the differences which is
available there between the and and
maven here now next thing is that what
exactly is in pom file all about so palm
file is nothing but it's kind of a xml
file which is available there and it's
have having all the information
regarding the project and the
configuration details so it primarily
used over here that how the
configuration needs to be done and how
the setup should be performed as such
here so palm.xml file is the build
script which we prepare uh you can
prepare it using a particular component
or you can have a particular mechanisms
or if you feel that you want to have
some kind of setup so all these things
typically can be implemented can be done
with the help of build tools so build
tools can be really helpful for us to do
the automations and it can really help
us to understand that how some build
processes we can automate with simply
with the help of palm.xml file here so
the developers usually put up everything
inside these uh dependencies in the
palm.xml file here so this is the file
which is uh usually present in the home
directory it's in the current directory
so that once the build is triggered it
will be picked up from that directory
and according to the steps according to
the content of the pom.xml file the
build will be processed or will be
created here now what i'll include into
the palm file here so the different
components which is included into the
pum dot xml file here is the
dependencies uh developers and
contributors plugins plugin
configuration and resources so these are
the typical components which is a part
of a permanent xml file which can be uh
same form a lot of projects you can do
some customization and then the same
prom file can be reused for the other
projects also now what are the minimum
requirement of the elements which is
there for a palm for uh powered xml file
so without which the pound xml file will
not be validated and will will be
getting a kind of validation errors so
the minimum required elements are
project root
model version so it should be 4.0.0 the
group id of the project the artifact id
of the project and the version of the
artifact these are the minimum things
which we want to define so that we can
understand that what kind of artifact we
are trying to prepare or we are trying
to create here so these are the minimum
required elements which is required in
the palm.xml file without which the
validation of the palm file will fail
and the build will also fail here
now what exactly is the mint uh with the
term called build tool so build tool is
an essential tool is a kind of a process
for building or compiling the source
code here so it's needed or it's
required for the below for generated
processes if you want to generate the
source code if you want to compile the
source code you want to generate the
source code you want to generate some
documentation from the source code you
want to compile the source code or you
want to package the source code whether
it's a jar file it's a war file or it's
a er file so whatever the packaging mode
you want to select you will be able to
do it with the help of the particular
build tool here and if you feel that you
want to upload these particular
artifacts to the artifact tree whether
it's on remote machine or locally there
so that also you can do it with the help
of this particular build tools here so
build tools can be helpful in doing a
lot of activities for the
developers now one of the different
steps which is involved to install maven
on windows now all you have to do is
that you have to just first of all
download the uh tar file from the maven
apache maven repository there once that
is done so what happens that you have to
set up some couple of environment
variables now if you download the java
jdk using the exe file in that case the
java underscore home will be configured
automatically but if it is not available
and you are not able to run the java
command line in that case you have to
set up the java underscore home and then
similarly for maven you have to go for
the maven undisco home that particular
variable you have to configure now once
that is done all you have to do is that
you have to edit the path variable so
the bin directory of the maven extracted
a folder you have to put it up into the
path variable and once that is done what
will happen that you will be able to
check the latest version the version of
the maven over there if it is like some
old version again you have to extract
the latest version and do the steps all
together again so these are some of the
ways that in which you can actually go
for the installation or the
configurations of maven on the windows
platform
now what are the different steps which
is involved for the installation of
maven on ubuntu so ubuntu it's fine you
just download the package of java jdk
there once the jdk is installed over
there what you can do you can simply go
ahead and say that yes i want to search
for a particular maven
uh package which is available there so
once the jdk is installed all you have
to do is that you have to configure the
java underscore home
m3 underscore home main and disco home
and the path variable once all the path
variables are something which is
configured then you will be able to
check the latest version like whether
it's a the version is correct or we are
getting the standard version over here
or not over here so that's the main
mechanism that how we will be able to
you know configure the maven on ubuntu
here now what exactly is the command to
install to char into the locals
repository now sometimes what happens
that we are not able to fetch
like uh some dependencies not present on
the uh particular central repository
movement repository or your artifactory
repository in that case you have some
third-party jar which we want to install
locally onto your repository so in that
case we can go for the uh but we can
download the jar file there and then we
can run the command called mvn install
install hyphen file and then we are
giving the path like hyphen d file where
the path of the file should be provided
now once that is done so what will
happen that in the local dot m2
directory
this specific artifact will be
downloaded and will be installed there
so this is a mechanism where you will be
able to configure or you will be able to
set up the artifacts locally the java
file locally here in the local
repository so next question is that how
do you know that the version of the
maven being used here so the inversion
of the uh maven is pretty easy to
calculate so all you have to do is that
you have to just go for mvn
and space hyphen iphone version the
moment you do that it will let you know
that what jdk or what java version you
are using and it will also show you that
what particular maven version you're
going to use here so all that details
you will be able to get with that
particular command here
now what exactly is the clean default
and frightened variable here so these
are the build cycles which is available
there in within maven so these are the
built-in build cycles so for clean what
happens that this life cycle will help
you to perform the project cleaning so
usually during the build there are some
files which is created into the target
directory so the clean life cycle is
essentially helping us to clean up all
that directory all that particular
target directory and when we talk about
the specific default so default
lifecycle handles the projector
deployment that is the default uh
lifecycle and site is something which is
uh you know helpful for creating the
site documentation
you know it's kind of a life cycle which
is available there so clean default and
site are the different life cycles which
can perform different different kind of
uh attributes or different tasks here
next question
what exactly is a maven repository so
maven repository refers to the
directories of the package jar files
that contain metadata now the metadata
refers to the palm files relevant to
each project so here you can able to get
your artifacts uh stored there you can
download these artifacts also during the
maven build if you put up that
dependency you will there are different
kind of repositories which is available
there one is the local repository one is
a remote repository and one is the
central repository so these are the
different typical type of repositories
which we have where we can uh store the
artifacts also and from where we can
download the artifacts also whenever
required now the first one is the local
repository so local repository refers to
the machine of the developers itself
where all the project related files are
stored there now whenever we work on the
uh particular maven so there is an in
the home directory dot m2 folder is
created now usually whatever the
artifacts downloaded from artifactory or
from the
movement repository it gets cached
locally there and once it is downloaded
next time it will not download the same
artifacts or the same dependency all
together again so this local uh
repository is something which is
available locally on the developers
machine only so it contains all the
dependent jars which a particular
developer is downloading during the
maven build now remote repositories
refers to the repository which is
present on the server and uh with from
where we will be downloading the uh
particular dependencies so the when when
we are running the maven build on a
fresh machine so usually over there the
local repository does not exist so in
that case what happens that the dot m2
directory is empty but the moment you
run the build what will happen that the
artifacts or the dependencies will be
downloaded from the remote repository
and uh once it is done once it's uh
downloaded it will be added or it will
be downloaded cached locally there and
it will be uh helpful in the future run
so that will be uh considered as a local
repository because all the artifacts all
the dependencies are downloaded there
and central repository is something
which is known as the maven community
where all the artifacts is available
there so usually we cache or we mirror
these central repositories as our
particular remote repositories because
it could be a possibility that these
remote repositories are something which
we are hosting into our organization and
central repository is something which is
available centrally for everyone to use
it so
these are something you know some kind
of repositories where each and every
artifacts will be stored and anyone will
be able to have the access to these
particular artifacts here so these
artifacts are every artifacts every open
source uh artifacts is something which
is available over there to these central
repository now how does the maven
architecture really work here so the
meeman architecture really works in the
three steps the very first step is that
it reads the palm.xml file here that's
the very first step second it downloads
the dependencies uh defined in the
panel.xml file into the local repository
from the central or the remote
repository here once that is done so it
will uh you know create or generate the
reports according to the life cycles
which you have configured whether it's a
clean install
site
deploy package or whatever the lifecycle
you want to trigger you will be
triggering that particular life cycle
and corresponding to that the build or a
specific task will be performed so these
are the three steps in which the overall
build or any kind of uh execution of
palm xml file really happens here now
what exactly is the maven build
lifecycle so maven lifecycle isn't
nothing but collection of steps here
that needs to be uh followed for doing a
proper uh build of a project here so
there are primary three built in uh
cycles which is available there default
which handles the project deployment
clean which handles the project cleaning
there and site which handles the
creation of the project sites
documentation so these are the three
primary built-in build cycles life
cycles which is available as such
now so build lifecycle has you know
different kind of phases or the stages
here because in the previous uh
particular slide we were talking about
what what are the different uh
particular build life cycles which is
available there but these are the
different phases like what are the
different step-by-step executions like
for the deep down which is available
there inside a specific maven build
lifecycle so here you can see that it's
compiling then the test compile test
execution is there then package
integration test to verify
install and the lastly deploy here so
these are the different build phases
which is available as such over here so
what exactly is the command to use to do
a particular maven site so mvn site is
something which is used to create a
maven site here now usually whatever the
artifacts is prepared that will be
prepared in the target directory so here
also you will be able to see a site
directory which is available there in
the target directory which you can refer
for the site documentations what is the
different conventions used while naming
a project in may 1 so usually it
involves three components
so the full name of a project in maven
includes first of all the group id
uh for example com.apache.com.uh
example so these are some of the uh
particular way that where you can
provide the group id artifact id can be
exact project name like maven project or
whatever the project you are creating so
sample project example project so these
kind of things will be there in the
artifact id and lastly is the version
like which version of your artifact you
want to prepare like 1.0.0 hyphen
snapshot
2.0.0 so like this information you are
providing that what particular version
you are trying to configure here now
let's move on to the intermediate level
where we will be having a little bit
more complex questions related to the
maven here now what exactly is a maven
artifact now usually what happens that
when we do a build process as an end of
result of the build process we will get
some artifacts for example when we build
a.net project so there we will be able
to have exe or dll files as an artifacts
similarly in case of maven when we do a
build process there we get the different
kind of artifacts like depending on the
packaging mode like jar file
var files or the er files here
so these are something which is you know
getting generated during the build
process during the main process and you
can store them into your local
repository or you want to push them to
the remote repository it's something
that totally depends on you so maven is
a tool which can help you to create all
the artifacts whether it's a jar file
whether it's a var files or whether it's
a er file here
and every artifact is having three
attributes the first one is the group id
the artifact id and a particular version
and that's how you will be able to
identify a full-fledged artifact as such
in maven so maven is not about only the
name of the jar file it's actually
referring to the attributes like crop id
the artifact id and the version of the
artifact here now what are the different
phases of the clean life cycle here so
clean is something which is being used
to clean the target directory so that a
fresh build can be triggered there so
there are three steps pretty clean clean
and post clean here so if you wish that
you want to override the particular life
cycle configurations and you want to run
some particular steps before the clean
activity so you can do it into the
pre-clean and if you want to do it like
some steps after clean then post clean
can be utilized now what are the
different phases of the site life cycle
so pre-site
site post site and site deploy so these
are the different phases which is
available there in the site life cycle
what is exactly we meant by the maven
plugin now
this is the huge difference between the
ant and even here because in and we were
not having this that much support of the
plugins and that's the reason why we had
to deal with all the build
configurations
so we have to simply put the overall
build process that how the build should
be triggered but that is not something
which is there in case of maven in maven
we have a lot of flexibility because we
can actually put up what exactly build
configurations we want to put here
we can put some features like important
features over here in maven and uh these
plugins we can utilize for example i
want to perform a compilation now i
don't really want to do any kind of
configurations in this one so what i can
do is that i can simply use the
compilation plugin in maven and that can
really help me because
i don't have to unnecessarily write or
rewrite the configuration that how the
compilation should be done it's
something which is pre-configured or
pre-written in these plugins that i can
simply import the plug-in and i can do
the build process or the compilation
process in a pretty standard mode so i
don't really have to do any kind of
workarounds with that and simply with
the small automations i will be able to
reach that how these maven plugins can
be integrated into my palm or xml file
and i can desire or i can have some
particular procedures and some steps
executed there so that's the biggest
benefit which we really get with the
help of moving plugins now why exactly
the maven plugins are utilized so to
create a jar files to create the war
files to compile the code files to
perform the unit testing to create the
project documentation and to create the
project reports so there are a variety
of things in which we can actually use
these maven plugins through the
integrations within the palm.xml file
there so it's all about the plugins you
just import the plugin and that desired
activity will be performed there now
what are the different type of plugins
which is there so
you can have either build projects
for performing the build activities you
can have some build plugins for
reporting plugins also there which can
be only generated or utilized to
generate the reports to process the
reports and do any kind of formatting or
any kind of processing on the reports
here so that is where the reporting
plugins are utilized now what is exactly
the difference between the convention
and the configuration in maven so
convention is in particular process when
the developers are not required to
create the build processes so
configuration is when you know the
developers are supposed to create the
build processes so the users do not have
to rectify the configuration in detail
and once the project is created it will
automatically create a structure so they
must specify every in case of
configuration you have to provide each
and every details so that's how the
configurations really happens because um
you have to put every detail into the
power xml file and that's how the
particular configurations really work as
such so this is the huge difference
between the conventions and the
configurations here
now
so why exactly said that maven uses
conventions over the configuration so
maywen pretty much does not puts any
efforts like on the particular
developers that they have to put each
and every configuration so there are
some ready-made uh plugins which is
available there and pretty much we are
making use of that so that in such a
case we don't have to worry about the
executions and we will be able to pretty
much work on that so conventions like
maven uses the conventions incident of
the configurations so the developers
just you know they don't just have to
create the movement project the rest of
the particular structure will be taken
clear automatically so they are not uh
you know expecting that the developers
should be doing the configuration work
and everything should be taken care in
such a way that you just have to start
the things and rest of the things should
be taken care by the maven itself so
maven will be
responsible because they do the plugins
it will be responsible to set up the
default architecture the default folder
structures and all you have to do is
that you have to just
place the source code in the desired
folder structure here so that's
something which you need to do as in
particular developers so what exactly is
the maven order of inheritance here so
the order of inheritance is the settings
cli parameters
parent palm and the project palm which
means that if you have some
configuration and settings that will be
the highest value then the cli
parameters are there then the parent
palm is there and then the project pump
so this is the way that how the
particular parameters or the
configurations will be picked up by the
may one so that's the order so what does
the build life cycles and the phases
imply in the basic concept of maven so
build life cycles consist of a sequence
of build phases and each build phase
consists of a sequence of goals when a
phase is run
uh all the goals related to that phase
and its plugins are also compiled so you
will be able to have a lot of particular
goals which is residing inside of phase
there and similarly life cycle is
nothing but a kind of a sequence of the
different phase so life cycle comes in
the top then it comes on the phases and
then it comes on the goals here now what
is the terminology called goal in case
of maven the term a terminology goal
refers to the specific task that makes
it possible for the the project to be
built and organized so it's something
which we can run so it's a actual
implementation which is going on there
for example in the build process in the
build phase i have a different goals
like clean install package deploy these
are the different typical goals which is
available there which i can execute into
the main one here so these are the
different goals like uh which we can
execute and which we can run during a
maven build next question is what is
exactly meant by the term dependencies
and the repositories in maven here so
dependencies refer to the java libraries
which we usually put up into the
pound.xml file there now what happens
that sometimes our source code is
requiring some java files like a
secondary jar files for performing the
build process so instead of downloading
it and storing it into the class path
for during the build process we just
have to specify the dependency of that
artifact what dependency we need to put
and once that dependency is put up there
we will be able to have that jar file
downloaded and cached into the local
repository during the maven build
project now if the dependencies are not
present in your local repository then
maven will try to download it from the
central repository and again if it is
not uh
you know it's something which is
available which is downloaded from the
central repository then it will be
cached locally into the local repository
so that's the cycle which is being
implemented and utilized during this
process
now what exactly is in snapshot in maven
so snapshot refers to the version
already available in the movement report
repository it signifies the latest
development copy that's what we do with
the case of snapshot here so meven
checks for a new version of snapshot in
the remote repository for every new
build so during the build process like
you know a new snapshot version is being
downloaded and the snapshot is updated
by the data service team which uh with
updated source code every time to the
repository for each maven build so snap
shot is something which we will be using
like very frequently we will be updating
to that and frequently we will be
updating the version to that and we will
try to explore and we will try to do the
modifications now what are the different
type of projects available in maven so
there are thousands of java projects
which you know uh can be utilized or we
can be uh implemented by my one here so
this helps the as the user that they as
they no longer have to remember every
configurations to set a particular
project for example spring boot spring
mvc spring boot etc these are the
different projects which is already
available in maven so most of the uh we
have already discussed that uh for the
job-based projects maven is something
which is you know considered as by
default so a lot of organizations are
actually using it for you know storing
or utilizing it for the particular maven
project now what exactly is the maven uh
archetype over here so maven octave
refers to a maven plugin that is uh
entitled to create a for project
structure as per its template these
archetypes are just project templates
that are generated by maven when any new
project is created there so this is
something which we are using so that we
will be able to create a fresh new
projects right so let's go on to the
advanced level of this maven questions
now what exactly is the command to
create a new project based on an archive
type so mvn archetype generate is used
to create a new java uh project based on
the archetype now this will take up some
parameters from
as an end user from you and depending on
that parameters it will create the
palm.xml file it will create the source
directories uh inside that main java
test all these different couple of
directories directory structures will be
automatically created now why we require
this command so that if you are going to
create a project from scratch from the
from the day one this command will help
you to have all the folder structures
created and then further on you can put
up your source code and those files as
such in this folder structure so that's
how is the mechanism that we will be
able to see that how the setup can be
performed really over here now what does
maven clean implies now movement clean
is a plugin that suggests that it's
going to clean the files and directories
there so whenever we do a build process
usually in the target directory we have
some class files some jar files or
whatever the generated source code which
is available that will be present in the
target directory so the maven clean is
something which is available which is
going to clean all these directories and
why we are doing this directly structure
cleanup so that we will be able to do a
fresh uh build process and there should
not be any kind of uh issues as such
over here so that's the main reason why
we are looking forward for this uh
particular mechanism or for this uh
particular changes as such here now so
what exactly isn't build profile all
about so build profiles refers to the
set of configurations uh where we can
have like typically two different kind
of build processes there so if you feel
that the same form.xml file you can use
you want to run for different different
uh particular configurations so that you
will be able to do pretty much with the
help of this component so build profile
is used to do a customization processes
so that you will be able to have the
process and uh you will be able to
perform the configurations and the
setups all together there so that's a
very important aspect to be considered
that which we need to uh discuss when we
talk about the build profile so build
profile whenever you feel that you want
to do some customizations and you want
to proceed with the setup so that's
where it's utilized next thing is that
what are the different type of build
profiles which is available there so the
build profiles can be done on for a
particular project like per project you
can do you can uh even do the build
profiles in the settings.xml file also
and if you feel that you want to do it
into the globalsettings.xml file so that
also you can do as such over here so
there are different ways in which you
can do the customization and once the
customization is done you will be able
to have the different uh ways of doing
the setups and the configurations over
there so what exactly is meant by the uh
particular system dependencies here so
let's talk about that also so system
dependencies refers to the uh particular
mechanisms where we feel that uh how the
dependencies should be uh you know
present there so that is something which
is having a scope of system there so
these dependencies are commonly used to
help maven know the dependencies that is
being provided by the jdk system
dependencies are mostly used to resolve
the dependencies on the artifacts that
are provided by the jdk so these
dependencies are somewhat which is being
utilized and used over here so that we
will be able to implement and go ahead
through the system dependencies what is
the reason for using an optional
dependency here so optional dependencies
are used to decrease the transitive
burden of some libraries so what happens
that when you download an artifact when
you put up a dependency so it could be a
possibility that some dependencies as in
particular optional can also be
downloaded now these are not always
required but yes sometimes what happens
that these are downloaded so that you
don't have to put uh each and every uh
artifact or dependency into the power
xml file for example you're trying to
download some apache tool and with that
some like three four jar files or three
four another dependencies are also
getting downloaded now if you are using
that dependencies that totally create
because you don't have to put that uh
list or that entry in the dependency
list in the power xml file and that can
really save your time but if you feel
that you don't want to have them and you
these are the optional ones and you
really want to
get rid of that so that also you can
exclude while downloading any kind of
dependencies so these are the optional
ones which depending on your requirement
you can utilize you can
process and if you feel that you don't
want to get it you won't want to process
it you can certainly ignore it and you
can get rid of that also now what is a
dependency scope and how many type of
dependencies scope are there so there
are different type of dependency scores
which is there which is used on each and
every stage of the build here so compile
provided runtime test
system import these are the different
kind of dependency scopes which we have
using which we can define that when
exactly we want to go ahead for a
specific build process so depending on
your requirement you can explore all
these build scopes and you can get
benefits out of that what is exactly an
intransitive dependency in may 1. so
maven avoids the need to find out and
specify libraries that our own
dependencies require by including the
transitive dependencies automatically so
transitive dependencies says that if he
depends if x depends on y and y depends
on z then x depends on y and both there
so which means that you are not
depending on one artifact you also need
the z artifact there with the y artifact
so that is what you need to do so that
you will get both the dependencies there
because this is normal that if you are
trying to
download some particular artifacts or
download some dependency and that
dependency is also dependent on some
other artifact or some other jar file
then you have to include both of them so
this is something which you will be able
to get so that you
can easily download all these uh
dependent jar files also and the maven
build can be success how can a maven
build profile can be activated so even
build profile can be activated through a
different ways so
explicitly using the command
command line you can talk about that
which profile you want to execute
through maven settings you can do uh
based on environment parameters os
settings and present and missing files
so these are the different ways in which
you can actually activate that which
particular profile you want to have so
profiles configurations can also be
saved in various situations and various
files and from there you will be able to
refer that which file you want to refer
as such now what is meant by the
dependency exclusion the exclusion is
used to exclude any transitive
dependency because you never know that
if you are trying to put up a dependency
uh entry in the power xml file that
artifact is also further dependent on
another artifact so in order to feel in
order to see that you want to exclude
that dependent artifact which is being
automatically downloaded that also we
can exclude with the help of exclusion
so you can
avoid the transitive dependency with the
help of dependency exclusions here so
what exactly is in mojo so mojo is
nothing but me one plain old java object
here so it's an executable goal in maven
and a plug-in refer to the distribution
of such mozos so moses enable the maven
to extend its functionality that already
is not founded in so it's kind of an
extension which is there and using this
we can get some additional benefits and
some executions over there so what is
the command to create a new project
based on a hard drive so again archetype
is something which we normally use to
create uh the new projects now you can
give the parameters in the command
itself or you want it to in in kind of
an interactive mode where it will take
the parameters from the end user and
according to that the project will be
created onto hard drive or onto server
wherever you wish you want to create you
can create a new project
so explain about the maven settings.xml
file so maven settings.xml file contains
the elements that are used to define
that how the movement execution should
be there so there are different uh
settings like local remote central all
these different repositories are
configured as such over here now in this
case what happens that usually the
configurations are done in such a way
that it can you know go for the
executions it can go for the build
process and the complete executions can
be uh involved and can be achieved as
such here so all these executions are
something which we can really perform
and uh here we can put some credentials
how to connect to the remote repository
how to connect to remote repository all
that stuff is something which we talk
about over here what exactly is a meant
by term superbomb here so superform
refers to the default bomb of maven so
the moms of maven can derive from so
it's nothing but a reference to a parent
pump which is available there that is a
super pump so if you define some
dependencies in that super pump
automatically the uh child pump will
also be able to inherit all those
dependencies so we can put some uh
executions like we can put some
configuration in the super pump so that
if multiple
projects are going to refer that they
should be able to refer that easily so
that's the reason why we primarily use
the super pump so that we can have the
execution some processes
put up over there and all the other
projects should be effort to refer or
inherit from there so where exactly the
dependencies are stored so dependencies
are stored like in different locations
like you have the local repository
remote repositories there local
repositories on the local developers
machine and remote repository something
which is available on a server in form
of artifactory jenkins is a popular
devops open source automation server
it is used to automate the non-human
part of software development and
supports continuous integration and
continuous delivery
jenkins is a server based system that
runs in servlet containers such as
apache tomcat
we have compiled the most important
jenkins interview questions that you
might face in a jenkins or devops
interview
so without further ado let us get
started with jenkins interview questions
and answers so the first question you'll
be asked about with jenkins is explain a
master slave architecture of jenkins so
the way that jenkins is set up is that
the jenkins master will pull code from
your remote git repository such as
github and will check that repository
every time there is a code commit it
will distribute the workload of that
code and the tests that need to be
applied to that code to all of the
jenkins slaves and then on request the
jenkins master and the slaves will then
carry out all the builds and tests to be
able to produce test reports the next
question you'll be asked is what is a
jenkins file and simply put a jenkins
file is a text file that has a
definition of the jenkins pipeline and
is checked into a source code repository
and this really allows for three
distinct things to happen one it allows
for a code review and iteration of the
pipeline it permits an audit trail for
that pipeline and also provides a single
source of truth for the pipeline which
can be viewed and edited so which of the
following commands runs jenkins from the
command line is it java
jar jenkins dot war java dash war
jenkins.jar
java.jar jenkins jar java dash war
jenkins.org
and the answer is a java
jar jenkins dot wall so when working
with jenkins you're going to be asked
what are the key concepts and aspects of
working with a jenkins pipeline and you
want to really hold out your fingers
here and go through four key areas and
that is pipeline node step and stay so
pipeline refers to the user-defined
model of a cd continuous delivery
pipeline node are the machines which is
which are part of that jenkins
environment within the pipeline step is
a single task that tells jenkins what to
do at that particular point in time and
then finally stage defines a
conceptually distinct subset of tasks
performed through the entire pipeline
and tasks could be build test and deploy
so which of the following file is used
to define dependency in maven and do we
have a build.xml
b
palm.xml c dependency.xml
or d
version.xml and the answer is
palm.xml working with jenkins you're
going to be asked to explain the two
types of pipeline used in jenkins along
with the syntax and so a scripted
pipeline is based on groovyscript as
their domain specific language for
jenkins and there are one or more note
blocks that are used throughout the
entire pipeline on the left hand side
you can actually see what the actual
script would look like and the right
hand side shows what the actual
declaration for each section of that
script would be the second type of
jenkins pipeline is a declarative
pipeline and a declarative pipeline
provides a simple and a friendly syntax
to define what the pipeline should look
like and then you can actually at this
point use an example to actually break
out how blocks are used to find the work
completed in a decorative pipeline so
how do you create a copy and backup of
jenkins well to create a backup
periodically back up jenkins to your
jenkins home directory and then create a
copy of that directory it's really as
simple as that a question you'll be
asked as well is how can you copy
jenkins from one server to another well
there essentially there are three ways
to do that one is you can move a job
from one installation of jenkins to
another by copying the corresponding job
directory the second would be to create
a copy of an existing job directory and
making a clone of that job directory but
with a different name and the third is
to rename an existing job by renaming a
directory so security is fundamental to
all the work that we do within devops
and jenkins provides the center core to
all the work that gets completed within
a devops environment there are three
ways in which you can apply security to
authenticate users effectively and when
you are asked about this question of
security within jenkins the three
responses you want to be able to provide
is a jenkins has its own internal
database that uses secured user data
from and user credentials b is you can
use a ldap or lightweight directory
access protocol server to be able to
authenticate
jenkins users or c you can actually
configure jenkins to authenticate by
using such as oauth which is a more
modern method of being able to
authenticate users you're going to be
asked how to deploy a custom build of a
core plugin within jenkins and
essentially the four steps you want to
go through are first of all copying the
dot hpi plugin file into the jenkins
home plugins subdirectory you want to
remove the plugins development directory
if there is one you want to create an
empty file called plugin.hpi.pend
and once you've completed these three
steps restart jenkins and your custom
build plugin should be available how can
you temporarily turn off jenkins
security if the administrative user has
locked themselves out of the admin
console this doesn't happen very often
but when it does it's good to know how
you can actually get into jenkins and be
able to resolve the problems of
authenticating effectively into the
system as an administrator so when you
want to be able to get into a jenkins
environment what you want to be able to
do is locate the config file you should
see that it's set to true which allows
for security to be enabled if you then
change the user security setting to
false security will disable allow you to
make your administrative changes and
will not be re-enabled until the next
time jenkins is restarted
so what are the ways in which a build
can be scheduled and run in jenkins well
there are four ways in which you can
identify the way build can be scheduled
on running jenkins the first is when
source code management commits new code
into the repository you can run jenkins
at that point the second can be the
after the completion of other builds so
maybe you have multiple builds in your
project that are dependent to each other
and when so many other builds have been
executed then you can have jenkins run
you can schedule build to run at a
specified time so you may have nightly
builds of your code that illustrates the
changes in the solution you're building
and then finally you also can manually
build a environment on request
occasionally you will want to also
restart jenkins and so it's good that
when a question around how do you
restart jenkins manually comes up that
you have the answers and there are two
ways in which you can do it one is you
can force a restart without waiting for
bills to complete by using the jenkins
url that you have for your environment
slash restart or you can allow all
running bills to complete before restart
are required in which case you would use
the command of the url for your jenkins
environment slash safe restart hey guys
welcome to a session on selenium
interview questions by simply learn in
this video we will look at most commonly
asked questions in the interview and
some guidelines on how to answer them
nowadays automation tool and especially
the selenium skills is a very key
requirement for an qa engineer or even
an automation engineer jobs so if you're
on an outlook of automation engineer or
a qa engineer positions i'm sure this
question bank will definitely help you
prepare for your interview so this video
consists of three parts basically three
different levels of set of questions one
is the beginner level second is the
intermediate level and then the advanced
level questions and each level has a set
of 10 most probable questions which you
might be asked in the interview so let's
begin with the beginner level questions
question 1 what are selenium suite
components so selenium is a set of tools
and libraries to facilitate automation
on web applications you already know
this it is not a single tool so what are
those components which are comprised in
the selenium so selenium comes with four
major components the first one is the id
id happens to be the most simplest tool
in the whole suite of selenium it is
nothing but an integrated development
environment which has a record and
playback functionality this was earlier
available as only firefox plugin however
you need to know that the new version of
selenium ide is available as a chrome
extension as well as a firefox plugin so
that means you can either use any of the
browsers that is firefox or the chrome
for recording your test scripts also you
should also know that the new ide comes
with many new features and
now this new ide has become more
powerful than what was available earlier
so some of these new features are like
reusability of your test cases it comes
with a better debugger now and most
importantly it supports parallel test
execution and how does it do that it has
a utility called selenium side runner
that's about selenium id the next
component is the selenium remote control
so selenium remote control or popularly
called as selenium rc is used to write
web application test in different
programming languages it supports
multiple programming languages like java
c
perl python ruby and php it is nothing
but it's a server which interacts with
your browser using a simple http get and
post request for communication selenium
rc is also called as selenium 1.0
version or selenium core third component
selenium webdriver it is a programming
interface to run your test cases and
webdriver was introduced by simon
stewart in 2006 and this was introduced
to overcome some of the limitations of
selenium rc so arses rc's architecture
was very complex because it required an
additional server in its setup and why
was that additional server for
communicating with the browser and what
webdriver did was it removed this
dependency completely web driver
interacts directly with the browser and
also makes your test cases run much
faster than your rc the last component
the selenium grid a very important tool
this is used to run multiple test
scripts on multiple machines at the same
time now with the selenium webdriver you
can only do sequential execution but in
real time environment you always have
the need to run test cases in a
distributed environment so this grid
allows parallel execution of tests on
different browsers as well as different
operating system so the design is in
such a way that commands are distributed
on multiple machines where you want to
run the test and they are executed
simultaneously this uses a simple
hubbard node concept where hub controls
the all execution of your test cases on
the nodes and this is how we achieve
parallel execution and what is the major
advantage of having this grid it is to
reduce your overall test execution time
question two what are the limitations of
selenium now like any other tool
selenium also has certain limitations so
when you are answering this question you
will also be expected to talk about what
is the around available for all these
limitations so let's look at them one by
one no reliable tech support of course
selenium is an open source so if you
look at it you do not have much
technical support available however
there are loads of documentation
available there are forums available
which you can refer to
seleniumhq.org is the website is your
bible if you're working with the
selenium and then there are there are a
lot of selenium google groups and the
forums which are available for any kind
of support so selenium has been there
for quite some time so it's it's one of
the most mature tool available today so
even though we do not have a technical
support available there is enough
documentation available on the internet
the second limitation selenium can test
only web application selenium is an open
source tool that is designed to automate
web-based applications on different
browsers but it cannot handle
windows gui or non-html pop-ups in the
application now what is the workaround
available for that selenium provides a
support for integrating other tools like
autoit so autoita is a tool for handling
your windows based activity selenium
also cannot automate mobile applications
but then what is available with that it
can integrate a tool called apm tool
which is a mobile automation tool the
third limitation limited support for
image testing selenium is a de facto
tool for functional web web application
tests so standard api allows interacting
only with the browser and it's hard to
test the images based applications using
selenium what is the other tool
available securely is a very good tool
to use for image testing and this again
you can integrate securely with selenium
that's how you can achieve your image
testing through selenium but using the
security no built-in reporting facility
so selenium does not have any reporting
capability as such of course it does
provide a very limited reporting
capability where some basic reports are
created but definitely when you are
working in a framework you need a better
support for
good reporting tools so that way
selenium supports some of the tools like
test ng report ng and extent reports
using which you can integrate these
tools with selenium and generate
beautiful reports limited test
management selenium does not provide any
test tool integration with test
management tools may require knowledge
of programming languages so since
selenium supports multiple programming
languages the developer of the test
automation will require to have some
basic knowledge of any of the supported
programming language why one in order to
write your effective automation scripts
and of course because selenium tool you
want to use it at its full potential
question three what are the testing
types supported by selenium so selenium
supports regression testing and
functional testing these can be called
as a very high level categories so what
is regression testing regression testing
is a full or partial selection of
already executed test cases which are
re-executed to ensure your existing
functionality does not break so let's
look at what are these attributes of
regression testing and why we say that
selenium helps us in doing regression
testing so regression tests are run
every time a new fix has been received
or a new feature has been deployed so
that is called as retesting you can
always select a full suite or select a
test to test a fix or a complete product
so your selection can be based on
recently added features a test area
where most defects are there or
integration areas or even end-to-end
kind of tests you can also prioritize
your test cases based on critical
functionalities and business impact of
this test cases according to the
priority set so all this can be done
using selenium now what is the second
category of the testing which it
supports functional testing so
functional testing includes what your
smoke does sanity test say it as
database test basically any kind of
functionality which you are going to
test and if you look at the kind of
steps which are involved in that it
involves identification of your test
inputs expected outputs or the results
the test case logic itself and the
assertions so a typical flow will be
you identify your test inputs first then
you derive your test outcomes or the
expected outputs you design and execute
your test cases and then assert on the
expected versus actual outcomes question
4 what are selenium 2.0 and 3.0 versions
so selenium was introduced by a
gentleman called jason huggins way back
in 2004 and that was selenium version
since then this tool has gone through
multiple changes to make it better and
better so if selenium two dot version
had a major change it took a leap
forward in terms of browser automation
the selenium rc the remote control had a
disadvantage of having the need of an
additional server to talk to the web
browsers and because of this the text
execution was much slower and the com
architecture itself became very complex
so if you look at this selenium 2 it had
two components a successor to rc and the
rc itself which is called as your core
so this successor was nothing but your
web driver api so web driver apis made
it easier to write your automation
scripts for any browser by simply using
a suitable driver for any browser which
you want to run the tests on apart from
these two components the selenium 2.0
version also had the id and the grid
components so in summary if you look at
it selenium 2.0 version has an ide it
has selenium rc which was on its way of
deprecation webdriver api which was just
introduced in there a very very earlier
version of webdriver api and the grid so
what is selenium 3.0 consists so
selenium 3.0 rc was completely
eliminated now because in 2.0 it was
already on its path of deprecation and
webdriver replaced rc completely so if
you look at the components of 3.0 we
have ide we have a web driver and grid
as the major components so now with this
introduction of web driver a
full-fledged web driver selenium became
the most powerful tool for web
application automation question five a
very important question what is same
origin policy and how was it handled now
same origin policy is a security id
feature so it is a very important
concept in web application security
model and what is this according to this
policy a web browser allows scripts from
one web page to access the contents of
another web page provided both these
pages are on the same origin now what
does origin mean origin is nothing but a
combination of your url schema the host
number and the port number it's
basically your domain now if a such
question is asked how are you going to
explain it so let's say you have a
javascript program which runs in a
certain domain say google.com okay so
this program can access all the programs
which are from the same origin now
origin here is what google.com so for
example you can access other pages like
your google drive your google email or
your google calendar however now if you
use the same javascript right so if you
use the same script from the google.com
to access another page or an element in
a different domain say yahoo.com then
the security model of the web
application itself prohibits you to do
so so what happens because of that is
you are limited with access only to
those elements and pages which are in
the same domain but now look at a case
that you want to run your test on
multiple servers and you might also want
to access multiple domain so due to the
same origin policy you will not be able
to do so and this became a major
limitation with a very early selenium
tool so how was this handled so this got
handled by paul heman who created the
selenium remote control so he created a
selenium remote control server to trick
the browser in believing that the
selenium core and the web application
under test actually came from the same
domain and this is how the same origin
policy was handled and this selenium rc
which is selenium remote control became
the version one of selenium question six
what is celine's and how is it
classified selenium commands for
selenium ide are often called as salines
they are a set of commands that run your
test and sequence of this command is
called as a test script now these
commands are categorized into three
major categories one is the action
command now action commands are the
commands that generally manipulate the
state of your application for example
they can do things like click on this
link or select a particular option open
a url type certain text into an input
box click or double click on any web
element and so on so these are called as
action commands the second set of
commands is the accessors now accessors
examine the state of the application and
store the results in a variable so it
basically allows the user to store
certain values to a user defined
variable for example if i want to store
the page title of a web page i can do
that by defining a user defined variable
and then these stored values can be
later used to create your assertions or
verifications in your test now few
examples of such commands are you can
just use a store story or a store text
store title or a store value so these
are some of the accessor commands the
third category is the assertions
assertions are like your accesses but
they verify the state of your
application and conforms to what is
expected so basically it is a comparison
of your actual versus expected results
there are two types of assertions
available one is the softer sessions and
the harder sessions an example of your
soft assertion can be verify title
wherein you verify the title check
whether the expected and the actual
outcomes are the same and continue with
your test case now whereas in hard
assertion is you do an assert title
using the command assert title and if at
all the assertion fails the test case
stops from executing question 7 mention
the types of web locator what is web
locator a locator is a command that
tells the selenium which ui element you
want to operate on selenium uses
locators to find and match the elements
of your web page which it needs to
interact with and there are around eight
locating techniques in selenium the
first one is by id now this is the most
common way of locating elements why
since the ids are supposed to be unique
for each element the ids can also be
dynamic in nature so you can identify
them by inspecting the attributes of the
web element so let's look at an example
so if we go to a facebook right so if
you go to the facebook and say if i want
to identify this element email so if you
look at this highlighted text here it
has a unique id which is email so if i
am going to operate on this particular
element email i can directly use the id
locating technique link text and the
partial link text so this type of
locator applies only to the hyperlink
text so we access the link by using this
locator which needs the hyperlink text
to be provided so for link text you can
give a complete text in the link text or
let's look at an example of that so
let's if we go to say one of the
e-commerce site which is say amazon dot
in and say you want to click on this
today's deal link so if you look here in
amazon.com there are a lot of hyperlinks
available here and if an example if you
have to take an example say we want to
click on the 2d still now if you inspect
this element you will see that it has an
anchor tag a it has an associated href
link here and also it has a text which
says today's steel right which is what
is displayed on your web page now
similarly there is also a link available
here called customer service so if you
inspect that customer service it also
has something similar what the today's
deal had it has an anchor tab it has an
edge riffling and it has a long text
which says customer service which is
what is displayed now if you have to use
your web locator which is a linked text
you need to provide the complete text
which is displayed on your web page and
there is another way of using the link
text by saying partial link text where
you can just give a partial text which
can be matched against the complete text
of your link and this is how you can use
your partial link text or the link text
the next id is by name so locating
elements by name is very similar to
locating by id just that your attribute
instead of using an id you're going to
use name in this case now if you look at
the same example of say facebook we
identified this email element using its
id you can also locate the same element
by using the name attribute which is
also unique in this case which has a
value called email tag name that's the
next identifier so locate element using
tag name of the element now say if you
want to identify all the elements on
your web page which are of type button
so that you can do by using the tag name
as button there for example again on
your facebook page i know that there is
a single button here which is of type
button and which has a tag as button and
this is the only button which is
available on this page so if i want to
access this particular element i can
simply use a locator technique called
tag which is button in this case next
locator class name so locate an element
using its class name attribute so you
can use this identifier only if you find
that a class name is unique for a web
element which you want to work with
class names are sometimes unique a web
element can also have multiple class
name or even you will find some elements
which has no class name so depending on
what is available in the attributes you
can use this class name for
identification so example the shown on
your screen here where it says find
element by class name input text
basically this is going to list out all
elements on your web page which has a
class name called input text the next
identifier is by xpath now xpath is a
language used when locating xml nodes
what is xml extendable markup language
it can access almost any element even
those without any class names or names
or even id attributes so whenever you do
not find a unique attribute for id name
or class name you can construct an expat
to create an unique identifier for that
particular element now for example on
this facebook page if you observe here
there is a label here called create an
account so if you inspect this
particular label it has no attributes
other than a tag called spam so if you
want to identify this particular element
and say display it this is one of the
ways to do it is through xpath css
selector so c is a selector are string
patterns used to identify an element
based on the combination of either the
html tag id class or any other
attributes locating by css selector is
little more complicated than any of the
previous method however the advantage is
css selectors work much faster than the
xpath the performance of your test
scripts is much better when you use css
selector than any other locating
technique now again as an example if you
see the facebook again you can identify
the same email here right i used an id
here or a name attribute here to
identify it so assume that if you did
not have any of those things or if you
want to use a css selector here you can
still do that by using this syntax this
is how you use the css selector to
identify an element question 8 what are
the types of weights supported by
webdriver now before even you answer
this question you should know why do we
need weights in selenium weights play a
very important role in executing test
cases most of the web applications are
developed using using ajax and
javascripts so when a page is loaded by
the browser the elements which you want
to interact may load at a different time
intervals not only this makes it
difficult to identify the elements but
also if the element is not located it
will start throwing element not visible
exception and how do we resolve this by
using the weights so there are three
different kind of weights available in
selenium first one is the implicit
weight the implicit weight tells the
browser or your web driver to wait for a
certain amount of time before it can
throw no such element exception now the
default setting is 0 for this once we
set a time what web web driver does it
it will wait for that time so if you
mentioned 10 seconds it will wait for 10
seconds until it finds the element and
even in the 10 seconds it is unable to
find that element only after that it
throws an exception now what is the
syntax of this implicit weight is this
is the syntax of this where you use
driver.manage timeouts implicit weight
and there is a timeout value say 10
seconds and the unit whether it's in
minutes seconds or milliseconds is what
you can mention implicit weight is
applied globally to all the elements
which means it is available for all the
web elements throughout the driver
instance implicit weight is defined only
once and it will remain same throughout
the driver object instance now let's see
what explicit weight is so explicit
weight is used to tell the web driver to
wait for certain conditions before
throwing an element not visible
exception it is defined to wait for
certain expected conditions only now
these expected conditions can check
whether the element is displayed on the
web page or not or can be clicked or not
so any kind of conditions you can
mention there so these are called as
conditional weights and they are applied
on a web element on a single web element
unlike the implicit weight which was
kind of applied globally to all elements
it is definitely recommended to use this
explicit weights when your elements are
taking longer time to load and also for
verifying the property of the elements
like say visibility of the element
located element to be click clickable or
element to be selected then we have
fluent weight now fluid weight is used
to tell the web driver to wait for a
condition that is very similar to the
explicit weight as well as a frequency
with which we want to keep checking the
condition before throwing the not
visible exception so fluent weight is
used to define the maximum amount of
time you want the web driver to wait for
a condition then if you look at the
syntax then there is polling every
second so polling every and you give a
timeout this could be like five seconds
so start pulling to see whether the web
element is available or not say once in
three seconds once in four seconds
depending on your use case and then dot
ignoring so you can also try to ignore
specific type of exceptions while
waiting now for example such as no such
element exception which is sometimes
thrown when searching for an element on
page so you can mention even that here
so fluid weight takes two parameters one
is the timeout value and the polling
frequency so when we have web elements
which sometimes are visible after few
seconds or sometimes it takes more time
than usual like we have ajax
applications as an example we can set a
default polling period based on our
requirement and then as i said you can
also ignore some of the exceptions by
pulling this element question 9 mention
the types of navigation commands
available in selenium so webdriver
provides a basic
browser navigation commands that allows
the browser to move forward backward
refresh and using the browser history
and this is done using some of the
driver.navigate methods right so these
are some of the commonly used navigation
methods first one is navigate to so this
method loads a new web page in the
existing browser window and it accepts
string as a parameter and returns
nothing so it's a void so the url you
mentioned here needs to be a fully
formed url driver.navigate.refresh
so this method refreshes or reloads the
current webpage in the existing browser
window it neither accepts anything so
there is no value path or it returns
nothing forward so this method enables
the web browser to click on the forward
button in the existing browser window
again this has this has no arguments to
be passed or it returns nothing
driver.navigate.back so this method
enables the web browser to click on the
back button in the existing browser
window again this returns nothing nor it
needs any argument question 10 what is
the major difference between
driver.close and driver.quitter so this
is again a very important question and
pretty confusing also sometimes so
selenium webdriver provides two methods
for closing the browser window one is
browser.close and the other one is the
browser.quit so you might think to use
them interchangeably and that's that's
what everybody thinks that both anyway
does the same function so it can be used
however it is not so both are two
different methods now driver.close
command is used to close the current
browser window which is having the focus
and in case if there is a only single
browser window open then calling this
driver.close actually quits the complete
browser session now it is used when you
are working with say multiple browser
tabs or windows and you want to just
close one of them which is in focus in
the test
whereas the driver.quit is used to quit
the complete browser session along with
all its associated windows tabs pop-ups
and everything so when do you use
browser.quit it is best to use use
browser.quit or sorry driver.quit when
you no longer want to interact with the
driver object along with all its
associated windows tabs and pop-ups
generally it is one of the last
statements of your automation scripts so
in case you are like working with
selenium with test ng or gij unit we
usually call this driver dot quit in the
after switch that is at after suite
method of our test suite thus by by
doing that we close the complete browser
session at the end of the test fit
execution now let's look at some
intermediate level questions question 11
how to type in an input box using
selenium so selenium provides a method
or a command you can say to insert value
into any of the input box and this
command is called as a send keys command
so send keys is a method available in a
web element now this is how you use the
send keys so here is an example so first
you need to find the element using any
of the eight locating techniques and
once you find the element in this case
which is an email field you need to call
a method called send keys send keys
takes an argument which is of type
string so you can pass the value which
you want to pass to the web element so
in this case you will be passing a gmail
id or any id which will be your email id
here and then similarly you do it for
your password field so first you find
the element password and then you send
the password using send case this is a
very simple method to use question 12
how to click on a hyperlink in selenium
so whenever you are testing a ecommerce
application you are going to find lot of
hyperlinks on your web pages which you
will obviously need to test now selenium
provides two locating techniques using
which you can identify this hyperlinks
and using these is what you need to
operate on the hyperlinks on your web
pages so one is using link text and
other one is using partial link text so
using link text you give a complete text
in the link text that is if you look at
in your e-commerce site let's say
amazon.com let's let's go to that
website and see what it means so in the
amazon dot in if you look at uh some of
these hyperlink text called today's
deals or amazon pay or sell or customer
service if you inspect this element you
will see that this is associated with a
link text which is called as today's
deal along with this href and of course
an anchor tag so one way of identifying
this link is to use this complete text
which is today's t also there is another
way by using partial link text for say
example you have a link text which is
pretty long and you do not want to use
this complete text instead you can use
the locating technique called partial
link text and give a partial text from
that in this example instead of giving
the complete customer service here you
can just say use a customer or you can
just use service as your text only thing
whatever will be required here is this
has to be unique on this page there
shouldn't be two elements which would
have this text which you are going to
use so let's quickly see this in action
how do we use this link text and partial
link text now we will be using the same
example of amazon.com so my use cases
first i will click on this today's deal
and after a sleep of two or three
seconds i will also click on customer
service and i am going to achieve this
one by using link text so if you see in
this program so i have this method
written which is going to click on
today's tale and this is using a
locating technique link text and then i
also have another method here by using
partial link text i'm going to be
clicking on the customer service link
right so let's see how this works so
i'll just go ahead and execute this so
this launches the amazon dot in and the
first thing what we are doing is it is
going to click on today's tale all right
that is done and then it will click on
the customer service link right so this
is how you can achieve clicking on the
hyperlinks in your web applications
question 13 how to scroll down a page
using javascript this is a very
important question and usually this gets
asked quite often in the interview you
should know that you can run java
scripts through selenium and selenium
provides a way to do this selenium
provides an interface called javascript
executor javascript executor and this
helps in executing any kind of
javascripts through the selenium
webdriver so this javascript executor it
has basically two methods one is execute
script and the other one is execute its
async script to run the javascript on
the selected window or on your current
page but why do you need this right so
if if you are answering this question
you should also have a background that
why at all this is required because
sometimes you need to perform certain
functions which cannot be done using the
locators what has been provided like say
scrolling down the web page itself also
sometimes you will see that you are
unable to even identify some web
elements using all the locating
techniques which is made available by
selenium so in such situations what you
can do is you can directly write a
javascript and execute it using this
javascript executor and if you look at
it the syntax is something like this so
it says javascript executor js is equal
to javascript executor and driver now if
you look at this javascript executor is
an interface that means you cannot
create an object of it and hence you
type cast it to your driver object now
how do you do this now first thing what
you do is you launch your web
application on whatever web application
is under test and then on that current
window you call this particular execute
script method using the javascript
executor and then you can perform any
functions here in this example we are
seeing a function which is crawling down
vertically so this function takes an
attributes or arguments like x
coordinate and the y coordinate now in
this example our x coordinate is zero
and y coordinate is one thousand that
means when this command gets executed
the page is going to get scrolled down
vertically by thousand pixels so why
don't we just see this in action so
let's go to
another program here called the
scrolling test.java so basically what
i'm doing here is i'm going to be
logging into amazon.com and then i will
show you how to scroll down by 600
pixels so it's a very very simple code
to write you launch your application
then you create your object of
javascript executor right actually you
type caster to the driver and then you
just use an execute script command or a
method this you see is your actual
script which gets executed which says
windows dot scroll by 0 comma 600 which
is x coordinate and y coordinate let's
go ahead and execute this so an amazon
dot in is launched and you should see
the screen scrolling down yes there we
go so just scroll down by few pixels and
that is 600 pixels what we mentioned see
i could scroll back again and that is
how you can achieve scrolling functions
and when do you usually use this say if
you have a very long web page and you
want to go and identify or do some
operations on the web element which is
probably available to you towards the
end of the page and that is when you can
use some of the scrolling functions
question 14 how to assert the title of a
web page selenium web driver provides
web driver methods and one such method
is called get title so what get title
does is it fetches the title of the
current page how to use this command get
titles returns a string which is nothing
but your title of your page that means
you need a string variable in which you
can store this value so what you do is
you define a string variable like it is
defined in this example to store your
title and then you execute this command
driver.gettitle which is going to fetch
the title and that value gets stored in
your actual title once you get the title
you can do any operations with that in
this case what we are doing is we are
trying to verify the title there are two
ways which you can verify them one is
using an if else statement where you
compare your actual title with the
expected title or alternatively you can
also use assert statements here right so
selenium provides a search statement so
using assert you can validate whether
your title of the web page is as
expected question 15 how to mouse over
over an element in automation many times
it is required to perform some action on
the element which gets visible only on
the mouse hovering on those elements now
in selenium action is a class which we
can use to achieve this functionality so
action class is defined in a package
called as selenium.interactions
this has a set of apis to emulate
complex user gestures it helps in
building the patterns of action and then
perform that action on a web element now
this action class provides a rich set of
apis like so for mouse events and even
the keyboard events so say for to
perform any kind of mouse event it
provides a method called move to element
now in this example what you do is you
initiate an object of mouse class and
then use this move to element method and
what it does is the element is scrolled
into the view first even before the move
operations happen so you could have
multiple actions like here in this
example we are just using move to
element but also you can if you want to
do a drag and drop observation you can
still have that so in such case where
you have multiple actions like a drag
and drop then you use a method called
build along with this so you say actions
dot move to element dot build and then
dot perform so dot build method is
called before the perform method and
what it does is it generates the
composite actions which has all those
multiple actions which you want to
perform on a web element then after the
building action is done you call a
perform method which actually performs
that action on your web element and this
is how the move to element method of the
action class is used why don't we just
see that in action let's say let's go to
our eclipse here and i have a mouse
hover test written here so let's say we
go to amazon.website so in the amazon
if you go to the shop by category you
see that so the moment i mouse over it
it is going to give me this drop down
list so for me to select any element
from this my first action on this web
page should be to go and just hover my
mouse over this web element called shop
by category and that's exactly i'm going
to achieve through my automation now
here in my methods here what i have
written i have said okay first launch
your website which is amazon.n and then
i'm finding that element which is shop
by category using an x path so you could
use any available locating technique to
find the element first and then i
instantiate an object of actions and
then simply i'm doing is i'm using the
method move to element and then i'm just
going to say perform that means my mouse
would actually get moved or over onto
that particular element okay so let's
see this in action so i'll just execute
this test case okay so amazon dot is
launched and now we should see yeah the
mouse actually moved to shop by category
and because of that we got this drop
down list so and this is how you can
achieve your mouse hover functionality
question 16 how to retrieve the css
properties of an element now css is
nothing but cascading style sheets it's
a style sheet language used for
describing the presentation of a
document written in your markup language
it basically describes your html
elements as how they need to be
displayed on the screen it's basically
the look and feel like your font size
the width height color and so on so it
provides a special and easy way to
specify various properties of the
element now why do we need this we need
to use a special method called get css
value to retrieve such chs properties of
web element why because we already have
a method called get attribute which can
retrieve the value of the attributes
right however the get attribute method
can only retrieve those properties where
the attribute and its value are
mentioned in your dom and hence all this
font size color cannot be retrieved
through the get attribute method and
that is why we use the get css value so
basically it works like your get method
and you need to provide the attribute
which you want to fetch using the get
css value so in this example what we are
trying to do is we have a web element
called the email id and of that we are
trying to fetch the font size so let's
again check this in action so if i go to
my web page here
let's close this so if i go to my
facebook and if i inspect this
particular element which is the email id
and on the right if you see there are
multiple other attributes of that
element you see right so you see the
background color you see the color here
then you see something called as font
size and say for example we want to
retrieve the font size of this
particular web element and you will also
see on the left where you are seeing the
dom here you do not see that font size
anywhere as an attribute and its value
here and that is why i cannot use the
get attribute method to retrieve it now
instead of that what i am going to do is
i am going to use the get css value and
use this font size for that so let's go
to my eclipse i have a method written
here where i log into the facebook and
then i'm going to first find that
element which is by id and i'm going to
retrieve the css value and i'm just
simply printing it on the console so if
i execute this so it's going to launch
the facebook and since i'm not going to
do anything on the facebook web page as
such let's go to my console here because
this is where i'm expecting the output
so here it has given me that an output
in the console saying 12px which is
nothing but your actual font says what
you see here in your html page right and
this is how you can extract your css
properties of any web element on your
web page question 17 what is page object
model popularly known as pom page object
model is a design pattern that helps
create object repositories for web
elements so writing selenium test cases
without say using any patterns may lead
to code duplicacy and also the code
becomes unmaintainable after some time
and say if you have web element locators
which changes over time then you will
have to go through the entire code base
to make all the required changes so
under this model for each web page in
the application there should be a
corresponding page class and this page
class will have all the web elements of
the web page and also it contains the
page methods which perform operations on
the web elements and the verification
steps required in your test cases are
the separate test cases they are not
combined in the same class now the tests
that use the methods of this page object
class whenever they need to interact
with the ui of that page the benefit
here is if the page ui changes that the
tests need not be changed only the code
within this page object class needs to
be changed that is you go and just
change the web elements or the locators
of the web elements only in one place
which is your page class and not in any
of your test classes or not test classes
so how does this form help so it makes
the code more readable maintainable and
reusable so there are two ways you can
implement a bomb or a page object model
one is done using the page factory which
is offered by selenium and then you can
also achieve a page object model without
using the page factory right using
directly the objects and the classes
question 18 can capture be automated
this is again a very favorite question
of the interview captcha is a security
feature that prevents bots and automated
programs from accessing sensitive
information yes and captcha cannot be
automated you will see that there are
many applications today who have captcha
why because it's a security feature it
is a concept to differentiate between
human and computers the idea of capture
itself is to prevent any automated
process or a robotic process to do any
kind of actions and say if you are going
to automate it then the entire idea of
having the captcha is lost so you should
never attempt to automate it but then
what do you how can you handle this then
one either you can ask your developers
to disable it in the test environment so
that you can test the whole application
without having to hit on this captcha
other way of doing is you can use static
data for your captcha so that you can
hard code that value in your test for
the time being and then since your
application has capture as one of its
functionality if you really need to test
that you can just test that separately
as a manual testing itself but not
automated question 19 how does selenium
handle windows based pop-up selenium is
an automation tool for automating web
applications it cannot handle windows
based application however we can use
tools like auto it and robot class along
with selenium to handle such pop-ups so
what are these tools robot class is a
java class which along with selenium can
simulate your keyboard and mouse events
it also helps in upload and download of
files and also to manage the pop-ups so
wherever you have a requirement of doing
a file upload operation in which if your
native dialog box opens up then one of
the way to handle it is using robot
class other tool which is available for
us is the auto it tool it is a freeware
and what it does is it uses a
combination of your mouse movement
keystrokes and window control
manipulation to automate any such task
which is not possible by selenium
webdriver and again this auto it tool
can be integrated with selenium and thus
you can achieve the automation of native
window based pop-ups question 20 how to
take screenshots in webdriver take
screenshot interface can be used to take
screenshots in web driver so selenium
provides us this interface for managing
our screenshot operations now
screenshots are desirable for bug
analysis so selenium can automatically
take this screenshots during your
execution you know that it is very
important to take screenshots when we
execute the test scripts say if we have
a huge number of test scripts running
and if some of the test case fail we
need to check why this test case failed
so using the screenshot functionality it
helps us debug and identify the problem
by looking at the screenshots so
webdriver has this built-in
functionality to take the screenshot
across the page and it's pretty easy to
use take screenshot interface is used to
capture the screenshot during the
execution now this interface has a
method called grid get screenshot as
which captures a screenshot and it also
stores in a location specified by us so
let's take an example of our facebook
page and say we fail a particular test
case on the facebook application and
then let's see how we take a screenshot
at that particular moment when the test
case fails so let's go to the facebook
page first and let's understand the use
case so in this facebook page say if i
am signing up on this page i need to
enter all this field now as a part of
demo what i will do is i'll just enter
the first name and the surname and i
will click on the sign up button with
this test case it should basically
not sign me up rather it should give me
some error saying that you need to enter
all the fees and at that minute we are
going to take a screenshot okay so
that's our use case so let's see how do
we achieve that so if i go to my eclipse
and let's say we go to my screenshot
test.java i have a method written here
so and these are the operations which i
just described which i'm doing it here
so i'm going to just send keys my first
name to the first name field second name
into the search name field and then i'm
just going to click on the signup button
now there are few things required for us
to do before we use the take screenshot
interface along with its method which is
the get screen shot as so i said that
this method stores the screenshot taken
in a file so that means i need to
provide it a file name and also a
location where it needs to be placed so
in our demo here in this test class what
i have done is i have created a folder
called screenshot in the same project
directory and then i am giving it a file
name called fblogin.png so that means
after the screenshot is taken it is
saved in a file called fblogin.png
and then it is stored in the location
screenshot folder and these are the
simple file operations of java which i
use to achieve this so let's execute
this and see how this happens so right
now i have this screenshot folder and
it's an empty folder so after the
execution i'm expecting that this
particular file would get created so
let's see that in action so i'll go
ahead and execute this java program okay
so we have launched the facebook.com and
then i entered the my first name second
name and it has also clicked on signup
after which it has given all this red
marks here and now this is what i'm
expecting in the screenshot so let's go
back to our eclipse i will refresh this
folder so i'll say right click and
refresh okay i have this file created so
let's open this file and see right so do
you see this this whole image has been
captured so now as a tester if at all
this test case fails for me i can always
open this png file and see what actually
happened and i can debug my test case so
this is how you use screenshot
functionality in selenium level
questions question 21 can you type in a
text box without using send keys so you
need an alternative way to use instead
of using the send keys function and one
such alternative is using javascript
executor so selenium provides an
interface called javascript executor and
this helps in executing any javascripts
through your selenium webdriver so you
can do any kind of function using this
javascripts and one of the functions
which we can do is the send keys kind of
a function now how to replicate a send
keys function using javascript so let's
see an example here now since this
javascript executor is an interface you
cannot create an object of this
interface so what you do you type casted
to your driver object the way it is done
here in this example and then you use
document dot get element id to get the
actual element on which you want to
perform the operations of sending the
keys now what is this document so it is
an object right so this document it's an
object that represents your html
document which is displayed in that
window and this document object has
various properties that refer to other
object which allows you the access to
modify any of your document content so
the argument which you are passing to
the java execute script is nothing but
your javascript now this javascript uses
the document object to identify your
element and then send the value which
you need to send to that element so
let's see this in action as how it works
so let me show you a small program here
all right so i have a method here
wherein i'm trying to identify the email
field of your facebook page so if this
is your facebook application this is my
email field and instead of using send
keys here i'm going to pass an email
value to this and how am i doing that
using a javascript executor right so if
i execute this particular java program
it is exactly going to do the same
function what i would do otherwise using
the send case so let's execute this and
see if i can see my user's id email in
the facebook application so the facebook
application is launched and there we go
so we this is the value which i have
sent using my javascript okay so this is
how you can use a javascript executor to
replicate a send keys method question 22
how to select a value from your drop
down list in the selenium web driver so
select class is a selenium web driver it
is used for selecting and deselecting
options in your drop down list the
objects of select type can be
initialized by passing the drop down web
element as a parameter to its
constructor like in this example i am
saying select drop down equal to new
select of test drop so test drop is
nothing but the web element which i have
identified using any locating techniques
after you create the select object then
you have three different methods
available for actually selecting your
methods and what are these methods one
is select by index now the index starts
with zero in the list so you can select
any element from your list using the
index side and then the second one is
select by values so this is used to
select an option based on its value
attribute select by visible text so this
is an option wherein you can select a
particular list item or an option based
on the text displayed in the option so
that means whatever text you can see on
your drop down list is what you will use
it to identify that particular element
so let's see the demo for this so i have
again a same facebook application which
i've considered here for demo so if you
go to our facebook application first you
know that there is a drop down menu here
now this drop down is for selecting your
bird date this has a day values which
you can select the month values right
and the year now what i have done in my
code is first thing is i have identified
all these drop down boxes using one of
i'm using mostly the id locating
technique here so you can use any of
your choice so once i identify the
element i created the select object
class for each of this and i pass that
web element to the constructor of the
select class so now my select element or
the object is ready to use so my next
step what i need to do is i need to go
and select the actual dates now in this
use case what i want is i want to select
a date which is 10th june 2005 that
means on my select drop down of the day
i should be able to select the day 10.
now this i am achieving by using select
by value and then i am selecting the bun
month based on the index which is the
index in this case is 6 which will
select the june for me and then the
third one i'm trying to select it by
visible text wherein i am selecting the
year 2000 y so when i execute this
program let's see how the date selection
happens
okay there we go so it selected the 10
the day 10 the june month and the 2005
so this is how you use select objects in
selenium question 23 what does the
switch to command do so switch to
command is used to switch between
windows frames or even the alert pop-ups
within your application right so there
are multiple things which you can do
with switch to now sometimes in your web
application say when you click on a
button it opens up a completely new
browser window or you'll also see it
opens up another tab in your browser say
for example let's look at one of this
application which i have let me go to my
browser
and say i
launch hdfc bank.com all right so this
is my application say which you want to
test now when you launch this first
thing is i see this advertisement pop-up
which comes up which is right now an
unwanted pop-up so right now i'll just
close this and now if i want to enter
this hdfc bank application first i need
to do a login so if i click on this
login button see there is a new window
which opens up and i need to go and
operate into this window so for any
further operations i want to do it on
this web page i need to switch to this
window and then say i want to click on
continue to netbanking and then continue
with my use case so now in this
application there are two windows open
one is your base window from where we
actually logged in and after i clicked
on the logging there is a new window
opened up right so this is where your
switch to command will help us to
switching to this particular window to
do any of the operations on this web
elements present on this window okay now
let's see how do we actually do this so
in order to do this first you need to
get the handle of the window by using a
command called driver dot get window
handle all right so now when you use
driver.get window handle what you get is
a unique alphanumeric value which is an
identifier for that window and once you
get this you use a command called
driver.switch2
dot window and you pass that handle
which you have fetched previously and
this command will actually switch to the
current window which is in your focus
now you will also come across a case
where there are multiple windows open
right now the example what we saw we
just had a single window but say if you
whenever you launch an application say
there are multiple windows which are
open so in such case you can use
something called as get windows handles
right now get windows handles what it
does it picks up all the active windows
at that point of a time and using a for
loop you can read into every handle and
then you do your operations specific to
your window handles also there is
another way wherein you can switch back
to your parent window so if ever you
want to switch back to your parent
window you have to use the same command
driver.switch2 and the handle what you
need to provide here is your parent
handling all right so this is about
windows then i also said switch to can
be used for your frames so what are
frames frames are usually used to divide
your web application or your web page or
the on the same domain into various
different windows or sections right so
for us to operate on elements which are
in different frames we need to first
switch to a particular frame and then
use the web elements on that so the same
command will be using now instead of
window here i would say driver dot
switch to dot free similarly even the
alert pop-ups can be handled using the
same command so in the case of alert
what you need to do is you have to say
driver dot switch to dot question 20 how
to upload a file in selenium webdriver
right a very important concept in
selenium webdriver we know that selenium
webdriver is designed for automating web
application right and file upload is a
very common scenario which we get with
every web application which we are
working with now there are two ways to
do a file window file upload operation
one is using the send keys which is the
simplest method and the other way is
using robot class now there are certain
prereqs required for you to work with
the send keys option now if you are
using the send keys option what you
basically need to do is you need to type
in the complete path of the file along
with the file name right in the file
select input field now this element
where you're going to enter your file
name should have certain attributes one
of the attributes it should have the tag
as input right and also it should have
an attribute called type which should
have a value of file only then it is
possible for you to enter a file name
and upload the file okay that is by
using the send keys method then the
other way is using robot now when when
is that we need to use robot where
whenever you have an application and in
your application usually for your file
upload you have a button which says
upload a file and when you click on that
it opens a new window and this window is
your windows explorer window or a finder
window depending on what operating
system you're working and these are the
native windows and we know that selenium
webdriver directly cannot handle the
native applications so in such case the
robot class helps us in managing these
native windows so what happens in the
robot classes it helps you manage your
file upload dialog box by simulating all
the actions required for selecting a
particular file from your dialog box and
then you go and upload them all right so
this is the example of using the send
keys question 25 how to set browser
window size in webdriver so you can
either maximize the window or set it to
a certain value now to do this you use a
simple functions provided by
driver.manage one of the functions using
driver.manage is
driver.manage.window.maximize
now this command maximizes the current
window and say you want to set a
particular window size rather than
maximizing it and then for that you have
a command called
driver.manage.window.setsize
now this set size takes an argument of
the type dimension class so this is
basically when you create a dimension
class you are passing the size of the
window which you want to create here
right so we use the dimension class
define the new dimensions of the window
and then pass the object of this
dimensions to the set size method this
is one way of doing it we also saw that
using javascript executor we can do any
kind of functionality so if you want to
minimize or maximize or set a different
size to your browser windows this can
also be done using a javascript okay
let's see a quick demo on how do we use
this driver.manage
dot set size or the maximize command so
let's go to my eclipse here so i have
this method written here so i have two
methods one method where i'm saying i'm
going to maximize the window this
particular command is where i'm saying
driver.manage.window.maximise and i'm
launching a facebook application so
first let's run this particular method
and see how our browser window behaves
so i'll just say execute this
so now you will see the whole window
your browser window is in maximized mode
so now from here i'm going to execute
the other set of lines here using which
i'm going to set a certain size now i'll
just comment out these two lines
and then these are the two commands
which i'm going to use right so here
what i've done is i've defined an object
of the class dimension and i've used 600
600 which is the size of the window
which i wanted to be and then using the
set size i'm passing this dimension
object to the set size method now let's
see how do we look at this browser
window now did you see that so it was at
a certain size and it just shrunk it
shrunk because i have used a smaller
size window
question 26 when do we use find element
and find elements now find element you
can use this command to access any
single element on your page and what
does it return it returns an object of
the first matching element of the
specified locator and this is the most
common command what we use for working
with every web element on the web page
what is find elements find elements is
used to return a list of web elements
right so each element which it
identifies is indexed with the number
starting from 0. it's just like an array
i'll show you an example of that so that
you can understand it better so let's go
to my eclipse here right so if you look
at this locators.java i have different
elements which i have identified using
different locating techniques right so
for that i use a simple command called
find element now say i have a use case
right wherein i want to fetch all the
web elements who have a class name
starting with the text input let's see
what that is so if i go to my facebook
application if i try to inspect this say
first name right so i'll say inspect
element now here if you see this
particular web element has a class name
starting with text called as input text
likewise there are many elements here
like even the surname if you look at it
it has a class name starting with input
text okay so if i have a use case like
that where i want all the web elements
on the facebook page who have the class
name starting with the text input if i
have to do that that is when i say i am
going to use the driver.find elements so
i say driver.find elements i give an x
path which is going to pick up all those
elements which has the class name
starting with input this is my xpath
expression once i get all the elements
what am i doing i am going to store it
in a list array once i have all these
elements created it's in an array i'm
just going to traverse through the array
using an enhanced for loop so in this
program in this test case i'm just
picking each and every element and
printing the attribute id of each
element so if i execute this now we
should see all the elements on the
facebook page which has the class name
starting with input and we should see
all the ids of that so this is what we
are getting so you are around getting 9
to 10 elements it has picked up and all
of them have the class name starting
with input and these are the different
ids
question 27 what is pause on exception
in selenium id so pause on exception is
a new feature of selenium ide it is one
of the brilliant debugger function which
this new selenium id provides us what it
does is it enables us or when this
particular option is enabled the
execution of your test pauses if at all
there is any exception which occurs in
your test scripts and because of this
what you can do is you can go and handle
that error by say changing your command
in the script and then continue your
test execution so this helps in
debugging your code pretty well so
whenever there is an exception say for
example and web element which you are
trying to identify has a wrong
identifier or it changes on your web
page then you can correct that command
which caused the exception and then
resume the test execution from that
point onwards so let's look at a simple
use case and see how exactly this works
so for example let's go to my browser
here okay so i have a simple use case
here where i want to login into facebook
using my email id and password and what
i have done is i have created a script
or recorded a script using my selenium
id so these are all the steps which it
has wherein it logs into the facebook
account then it clicks on the email
field enters the email this is my value
which i'm passing clicks on the password
field enters the password and then
clicks on the login button now this is a
clean test script and all my web
elements are correct here so whenever i
am running this test with this test
script is going to pass now say as an
example say this particular element
which is my password element say this id
changes so now deliberately what i'm
going to do i'm just going to give a
wrong id here so if i give a wrong id
and if i execute this test script now it
is going to throw an exception at this
point so let's do that so it's going to
throw an exception but now since i want
to use that pause and exception feature
what i do is it's available here it says
pause and exception by default it is
switched off so when you select this
that means this has been switched on and
now if i execute the script this is
going to come into a debug mode at this
point where my exception is going to be
true so let's see that so now i have
this i have changed this id to a wrong
id so i'll just say go and run this
current test so let's see how it
operates so let me just bring this side
by side so you can see here it has
entered the email and if you look here
in the console it is saying trying to
find the id for which i have given pa
and 4s which is a wrong id so it will
look for some time whether it can find
an element with this particular id so
let's wait for it to throw the exception
there we go so now it tried enough and
actually that step has failed and there
is an exception saying that that
particular web element is not found
however my test case or the test script
did not exit it has come and paused and
it has entered into a debug mode here
paused and debug now as a tester or an
automation scriptwriter what i can do
here is i can simply go and correct this
now i know this is my correct id once i
correct this i can execute the rest of
the script right from this point so now
i have this option here if you go here
it says resume test execution so i'm
just going to click on that so it is
going to go ahead and enter everything
else if you see here i entered email
password and in this test script what
i'm doing is i'm entering my first name
and my surname instead of clicking on
the login button so it went ahead and if
you look here it says fb test completed
successfully this is how the pause and
exception feature helps us question 28
how to login into any website if it is
showing an authentication pop-up for
username and password which will be
something like this so this is a typical
authentication pop-up which you normally
see when you are dealing with some web
application right and to handle them we
use something called as an alert class
and alert class comes with a method
called authenticate using basically by
using this method what we are trying to
do is it helps us skip the basic http
authentication box so how do we handle
it it is handled exactly the way we
handle any kind of alert box and
selenium now in this example first what
we need to do is we need to create a
weight object using an explicit weight
now this weight is for what it is for
the alert to pop up so we basically wait
until that authentication alert pops up
and set the conditions in this explicit
way for as alert is present so that
means you're going to wait until your
authentication pop-up is seen on your
screen and then once you have that
authentication pop-up which is on your
screen that is when you need to go and
handle it now to handle it for your
alert class you're going to call a
method as i said using authenticate
using and to this you pass a parameter
now this parameter has to be your
username and password however the way
the parameters are passed here is using
a class object called user and password
now this user and password class it is a
part of selenium security package all
right and this is implemented from an
interface called credentials so you
create this object of class user and
password using the authentication
information which you have and then pass
this as parameter to your method called
authenticate using and this way you can
handle your authentication popup
question 29 what is the difference
between single and double slash in xpath
a very important question and it's a
very important thing for each of you to
understand single slash is used to
create an x path with absolute path that
is the x path would be created right
from the starting node and the starting
node is slash html and the double slash
is created or it's a x path with
relative path now relative path this x
path would be created uh using any
starting location or anywhere within the
document for example i could start with
a div tag wherein if i mention double
slash ender so this is going to be
treated as a relative path and whatever
conditions i am going to give it is
going to try and match those attributes
with the stack right this is called as a
relative path so why don't we just go
and take a look at how do we identify an
element using a relative as well as an
absolute path so if i go back to the
same application of the facebook this is
my facebook application now i have this
crow path installed which helps me in
identifying x parts of an element now
say i want to try and see what is the x
path of my element first name so in the
inspector tool i can see that it has a
tag input and it has a long class name
and it has multiple attributes which i
can use to identify this element so if i
go to my crow path and again try to
match this element so if i just hover my
mouse here now here you can see this
scroll path gives me both the path one
is the relative x path and one is the
absolute x path now look at the big
difference between these two now
relative path was as simple as using a
slash slash input which is the tag and
an attribute called id we are able to
identify this particular element same
thing if you want to use an absolute
path and you if you see here it will
start right from the slash html which is
your starting node of your html page and
then it travels down looking into each
of the parent and child under this until
it found this element input right so
this is absolute path so you can use
either of these paths to identify your
elements question 30 how do you find
broken links in selenium webdriver now
http is designed for what to enable
communications between your clients and
servers and if you know there are few
commands like get put post now get is
used to request data from a specified
resource put command is used to send
data over your server and post is used
to send data to the server right now by
using these links and trying to figure
out if the link is valid or not what you
can do is you can use something called
as head requests now what are head
request head requests are nothing but
they are something like a get request
but they do not have a response body and
usually this is used for checking that
what a get request can return before
actually making a get request like say
before downloading a large file you
would send a head request before sending
the complete get just to know whether
the link which is provided for
downloading a large file is a genuine
link or not and then looking at the
response code is what you decide that so
how do we do this programmatically now
selenium provides something called as
http url connection class which has some
methods to send http request and to
capture the http response codes like the
ones which you see it on the screen so
if we have to see how do we do that now
first thing the logic behind how do we
get this broken links is you get all the
urls on your website first after getting
all the urls now how do you get the urls
by using the tag a like it is done here
so once you get the complete list of all
urls you also check for a non well a non
null or a blank ones that is one kind of
a check which you can put after that you
create an http connection object with
each of the url and you open the
connection of the url and you send the
request now this request whatever you're
going to send you are going to send the
header request to just to get the head
and not the complete get request now
only thing what you're interested in
getting a response code so once you get
the response code what you have to do is
you have to check the response code
against all your response code now
typically when you're checking for your
response code any response code above
400 is treated as a client error rest
all the links below 400 are all the
valid links so here if you see 404 you
have a response call as link not found
400 is a bad request 401 is unauthorized
so you can do a simple check there where
it says if your response code is above
500 then that particular link has an
error and that is probably going to be
your invalid link so let's see that in
action as how exactly the code is going
to look and how do we achieve that now i
have a test case written here called
broken links.java now here what i'm
doing is i'm logging into facebook.com
and then i'm fetching all the elements
with the tag a now when i say i'm
fetching all the elements with the tag
that means i'm going to get all the href
element from the page and once i get
that using a for loop i'm going to
inspect each and every url what i'm
going to fetch as i said my first check
would be to see if it is a null or is it
an empty if i find an empty or a null
value in the url i'm just going to
ignore that and continue the loop and
this is where i actually do the
connection with my url so i create an
http url connection with the url which i
have picked it up from my website then i
do this i send a request here the head
request to get a response code so once i
get this response code is what i put a
if else statement and check if my
response code is greater than or equal
to 400. so if i find that if my response
code is more than 400 that means this
particular url link is broken and that
is how i identify so once you identify a
particular url which is broken you can
make use of that information share it
with your developers and get it fixed so
let us go ahead and execute this so in
this test case basically what i am going
to do is i am just printing out all the
urls and i am printing the ones which
are valid and ones which are broken uh
since it's a
facebook.com website i do not have any
broken url but this is just a logic of
how do we find a broken url so if you
look here a lot of websites which is
getting listed which says is a valid
link so that means it is getting a
response code which is more than 500 so
this is what we saw in the demo as how
do i i trade after i select all the
links on the page and then how do i
determine whether it's a valid link or
it's a broken leg docker is a popular
devops tool used to automate the
deployment of applications in
lightweight containers so that
applications can work efficiently in
different environments
docker was initially released in 2013
and since then has become the go to
solution for containerization
in this video we have compiled the most
important docker interview questions
that you might face in a docker or
devops interview
so without further ado let's get started
so let's go through and you're going to
be asked to explain what the
architecture of docker is and docker
really is the most popular
containerization environment so docker
uses a client server architecture and
the docker client is a service which
runs in a command line and and then the
docker daemon which is run as a rest api
within the command line will accept the
request and interacts with the operating
system in order to build the docker
images and run the docker containers and
then the docker image is a template of
instructions which is used to create
containers the docker container is an
executable package of applications and
its dependencies together and then
finally the docker registry is a service
to host and distribute docker images
among other users so you'll also be
asked to provide what are the advantages
of docker over virtual machine and and
this is something that comes up very
consistently in fact and you may want to
even extend it as having what are the
differences between having a dedicated
machine a virtual machine and a docker
or docker-like environment and really
the the arguments for docker are just
absolutely fantastic you know first of
all docker does contain and occupy
docket containers occupy significantly
less space than a virtual machine or a
dedicated machine the boot up time on
docker is significantly faster than a vm
containers have a much better
performance as they are hosted in a
single docker image docker is highly
efficient and very easy to scale
particularly when you start working with
kubernetes easily portable across
multiple platforms and then finally for
space allocation uh docker data volumes
can be shared and reused among multiple
containers the argument against virtual
machines is significant and particularly
if you're going into an older
environment where a company is still
using actual dedicated hardware and
haven't moved to a cloud or cloud-like
environment your arguments for docker
are going to be very very persuasive be
very clear on what the advantages are
for docker over a virtual machine
because you want to be able to
succinctly share them with your team and
this is something that's important when
you're going through the interview
process but also equally important
particularly if you're working with a
company that's transitioning or going
through a digital transformation where
they aren't used to working with the
tools like docker you need to be able to
effectively share with that team what
the benefits are so how do we share
docker containers with different nodes
and in this instance what you want to be
able to do is leverage the power of
docker swarm so docker swarm is a tool
which allows the it administrators and
developers to create and manage clusters
of swarm nodes within the darker
platform and there are two elements to
the node there's the manager node and
then there's the the worker node the
manager node as you'd assume matches the
entire infrastructure and the working
node is actually the work of the agent
as it gets executed so what are the
commands to create a docker swarm and so
here we have an example of what a
manager node would look like and once
you've created a swarm on your magic
node you can now add worker nodes to
that swarm and again when you're
stepping through this process be very
precise in the execution part that needs
to be taken to be able to effectively
create a swarm so start with manager
node and then you create a worker node
and then finally when a node is
initialized as a magic node it can
immediately create a token and that
token is used for the worker nodes and
associating the ip address with the
worker nodes question 17 how to run
multiple containers using a single
service it is possible to run multiple
containers a single service by using
docker compose and docker compose will
actually run each of the services in
isolation so that they can interact with
each other the language used to write
out the compose files that allow you to
run the service is called yaml and yamos
stands for yet another markup language
so what is the use of a docker file so a
dockerfile actually is used for creating
docker images using the build command so
let's go through and show on the screen
what that would look like and this would
be an opportunity where if you're
actually in a technical interview you
could potentially even ask hey can i
draw on a whiteboard and show you what
the architecture for using the build
command would look like and what the
process would look like um again when
you're going through an interview
process as someone who interviews a lot
of people one of the things i really
like is when an interview candidate does
something that's slightly different and
in this instance this is a great example
of where you can stand up to the
whiteboard and actually show what can
actually be done through actually
creating images on the whiteboard very
quickly little square boxes where you
can actually show the flow for creating
a build environment as an architect this
should be something that you're
comfortable doing and by doing it in the
interview and suddenly you want to ask
permission before you actually do it but
doing this in the interview really helps
demonstrate your comfortable feelings of
working with these kind of architecture
drawings so back to the question of
creating a docker file so we go through
and we have a docker file that actually
then goes ahead and creates the docker
image which then in turns creates the
docker container and then we are able to
push that out up to a docker hub and
then share that docker hub with
everybody else as part of the docker
registry with the whole network so what
are the differences between docker image
and docker containers so let's go
through the docker image so the docker
images are templates of a docker
container an image is built using a
docker file and it stores that docker
file in a docker repository or a docker
hub
and you can use docker hub as an example
and the image layer is a read only file
system the docker container is a
collection of the runtime instances of a
docker image and the containers are
created using docker images and they are
stored in the docker daemon and every
container is a layer is a read write
file system so you can't replace the
information you can only append to it
so while you can actually use yaml or
writing your so a question you can be
asked is instead of yammer what can be
an alternate file to build docker
compose so yaml is the one that is the
default but you can also use json so if
you are comfortable working with jason
and my that is something that you should
get comfortable with is you want to be
able to use that to name your files and
as a frame of reference json is a
logical way of being able to do value
paired matching using a javascript like
syntax
so you're going to be asked to how to
create a docker container so let's go
through what that would look and we'll
break it down task by task so the task
is going to be create a mysql docker
container so to do that you want to be
able to build a docker image or pull
from an existing docker image from a
docker repository or hub and then you
want to be able to then use docker to
create a new container which has my
sequel from the existing docker image
simultaneously the layer of read write
file system is also created on top of
that image and below at the bottom of
the screen we have what the commands
lines look for that so what is the
difference between a registry and a
repository so let's go through that so
for the docker registry and repository
for the registry we have docker registry
is an open source server-side service
used for hosting and distributing docker
images whereas in contrast for
repositories a collection of multiple
versions of a docker image in a registry
a user can distinguish between docker
images with their tag names and then
finally on the registry docker also has
its own default retreat called docker
hub for the repository it is a
collection of multiple versions of
docker images it is stored in a docker
registry and it has two types of public
and private registry so you can actually
create your own enterprise registry so
you're gonna be asked you know what are
the cloud platforms that uh support
docker really you know lists them all
and we have listed here amazon web
services microsoft azure google cloud
rackspace but you could add in their ibm
bluemix could put in red hat really any
of the cloud service providers out there
today do support docker it's just become
an industry standard so what is the
purpose of expose and publish commands
in docker so if we go through expose is
an instruction used in dockerfile
whereas publish is used in docker run
command for expose it is used to expose
ports within a docker network whereas
with publish it can be used outside of a
docker environment for expose it is a
documenting instruction used at the time
of building an image and running a

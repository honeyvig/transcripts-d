hi everyone welcome to the simply learn
youtube channel
this session will be about calling grpc
before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
in this session you will learn about
what grpc is
next you will learn about the grpc basic
concepts you will get to know when the
grpc is used and further you will learn
about the strengths and weaknesses of
grpc
and moreover we will learn about the
companies using grpc
let's start with what grpc is
grpc is an open source framework that
handles rpc that is remote procedure
calls and helps build scalable and fast
apis it allows the client and server
applications to communicate
transparently and help developers
develop connected systems
this framework works on http slash 2
protocol buffers and other modern
technology stacks to ensure maximum api
security performance and scalability
next
we will learn about the grpc basic
concepts
that is
protocol buffers
streaming
http slash 2
and channels
let's understand these concepts in
elaboration
first one we'll start with protocol
buffers
protocol buffers or protobuf is google's
serialization or deserialization
protocol
it is used as
interface definition language idl and
serialization toolset by grpc both the
client and server should have the latest
and same protofi
grpc stores your data and function
contracts in the form of protofides
protoc that is the protobuf compiler
generates client and server code using
the dot protocol
it loads the
code using the dot protofile
into the memory at runtime and uses the
in-memory schema to serialize or
deserialize the binary message you can
exchange the data faster with protobuf
as it requires fewer cpu resources since
data is converted into binary format and
encoded messages are smaller in size
the next concept we have is streaming
streaming is another key concept of grpc
where many processes can take place in a
single request
the multiplexing capability that is
sending multiple responses or receiving
multiple requests together or a single
tcp connection
of http slash 2 makes it possible
now we'll see through the types of
streaming the first one is server
streaming rpgs the client sends a single
request to the server and receives back
a stream of data sequences that is
server streaming rpcs the next is client
streaming rpgs the client sends a stream
of data or sequences to the server
which then processes and returns a
single response to the client that is
client streaming offices the next we
have is bi-directional streaming rpgs it
is two-way streaming where both client
and server send a sequence of messages
to each other without failing for a
response
now we will move to another concept that
is http slash 2.
it is another key concept of grpc in a
traditional http protocol sending
multiple requests or getting multiple
responses together in a single
connection was impossible a new
connection will need to be created for
each of them
this kind of request for response
multiplexing is made possible in http
slash 2 by introducing a new layer
called binary framing
and bi-directional streaming was
possible full-fledged with the
introduction of http slash 2. the next
concept we'll move on is channels
channels are another key concept the
http slash two streams allow many
simultaneous streams on one connection
channels extend this concept by
supporting multiple streams or multiple
concurrent connections they provide a
way to connect to the grpc server on a
specified address and port and are used
in creating a client stuff
now we will understand the grpc
architecture
in the following grpc architecture
diagram we have the grpc client and
server sides in grpc every client server
has a grpc stub the grpc client makes
the local procedure called to the stub
with parameters
that to be sent to the server the client
stub then serializes the parameters with
the marshalling process using protobuf
and forwards the request to the local
client time library in the local machine
the os makes a call to the remote server
machine via http slash 2 protocol the
servers os receives the packets and
calls the server step procedure which
decodes the received parameters and
executes the respective procedure
invocation using protobuf the server
stub then sends back the encoded
response to the client transport layer
the client stub gets back the result
message and unpacks the return
parameters and the execution returns to
the follow
moving on we'll learn when to use grpc
grpc is used in real-time communication
services where you deal with streaming
calls
and it's used when efficient
communication is a goal
and it's used in multi-language
environments and moreover it is used in
internal apis where you don't have to
force technology choices on clients
and it's also used in new builds as part
of transforming the existing rpc api
let's see grpc strengths which has
increased the adoption on the old rpc
design methods
the first one is performance
by different evaluations grpc differs up
to 10 times faster performance and ape
security than rest plus json
communication
as it uses protobuf and http slash 2.
additionally protobuf serializes the
message on the server and client sides
resulting in small and compact message
payloads satp slash 2 scales up the
performance ranking via server push
multiplexing and header compression
server push enables http slash 2 to push
content from server to client before
requesting while multiplexing eliminates
head of the line blocking http slash 2
uses a more advanced compression method
to make the messages smaller resulting
in faster loading
the next one we have is built-in
community features
grpc provides built-in support for
commodity features such as metadata
exchange encryption authentication
deadline or timeouts and cancellations
it also provides load balancing service
discovery and many more
now we'll see another strength that is
streaming
grpc makes it much simpler to build
streaming services or clients a grpc
service supports
different streaming combinations through
http slash 2 which we have seen earlier
that is client to server streaming
server to client streaming or
bi-directional streaming
the next is security the use of http
slash 2 or the tls that is end-to-end
encryption connection
in grpc and shows api security grpc
encourages the use of ssl or tls to
authenticate and encrypts data exchanged
between the client and server
now we have known the strengths of grpc
now you need to be aware of some points
before choosing grpc for developing
applications these points may affect
your decision of using grpc
the first one we'll see
is limited browser support as grpc
heavily uses http slash 2 it is
impossible to call a grpc service from a
web browser directly
no modern browser provides the control
needed all web requests to support a
grpc client therefore a proxy layer and
grpc web are required to perform
conversions between http 1.1 and http
slash 2.
the next is steeper learning curve
many teams find grpc challenging to
learn
they get familiar with protobuf and look
for tools to deal with http slash to
friction it is a common reason why users
prefer to rely on rest for as long as
possible
the next is non-human readable format
protobuf compresses grpc messages into a
non-human readable format this compiler
needs the messages interface description
in the file to deserialize correctly so
developers need additional tools like
the grpc command line tool to analyze
protobuf payloads on the wire
and they also write manual requests and
perform debugging the next is no edge
caching while http supports mediators
for edge caching grpc polls use the post
method which is a threat to api security
the responses can't be cached through
intermediaries moreover the grpc
specification doesn't make any
provisions and even indicates the wish
for cache semantics between server and
client
the next is limited community support
the community support for specific
technology can be a big consideration
for its adoption
with minimal developer support outside
of google and not many tools created for
http slash 2 and protocol buffers the
community lacks information about best
practices
this is changing the developers coming
in and adopting grpc the next we'll see
is the companies using grpc the first
it is an american multinational
technology company that focuses on
artificial intelligence search engine
technology online advertising cloud
computing computer software quantum
computing e-commerce and consumer
electronics the next company that uses
grpc is ibm that is international
business machines corporation it's an
american multinational technology
corporation headquartered in new york
with operations in over 171 countries
the next one that uses grpc is netflix
it's an american subscription streaming
service and production company it was
launched in 1997. it offers a film and
television series library through
distribution deals as well as its own
production that is known as netflix
originals
the next company that uses grpc is cisco
it's also an american multinational
technology
and it's located in california the next
one we have is dropbox it's a file
hosting service operated by the american
company dropbox incorporation it's also
headquartered in u.s that is san
francisco california it offers cloud
storage file synchronization personal
cloud and client software

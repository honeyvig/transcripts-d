hello everyone this is Joe param you
from theme and Lia's conquer in this 32
series we are going to discuss some
important points from the topic biology
point number one
influenza is caused by or tomexal virus
which is a RNA virus number two both
intranuclear and intracytoplasmic
inclusions are present in measles virus
number three the time gap between
appearance of public spots and cutaneous
rash in measles is three to four days
number four certain viruses have been
isolated in crystalline form and have
been found to be nuclear proteins
point number five most common route of
spread of hepatitis A and E is free
coral route number six carrier Street
does not exist for hepatitis a number
seven incubation period of hitch bees 45
to 180 days number eight age group
affected by hepatitis A viruses children
number nine then particle is HPV number
ten hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus for
number eleven HPS antigen is known as
surface antigen or Australian condition
number twelve
first antibody appears in hepatitis is
IgM for number thirteen most common
cause of chronic hepatitis is HCV number
fourteen HDV is known as defective virus
number fifteen in pregnancy the maternal
mortality rate is high for hepatitis E
infection
point number sixteen HIV virus is
discovered in the a or 1986 number
seventeen in HIV gp120 envelope
glycoproteins
binds specifically to cd4 T cells number
eighteen seroconversion in HIV infection
takes place in four weeks
number 19 most common mode of

transmission is blood and blood products
number twenty mother-to-child

and organ donation it is 50 to 90% and
from mother to child the HIV
transmission is of 30% point number 25
RNA DNA RNA is the sequence which a
retrovirus follows on entering the host
cell number 26 in India most common

zero a key number 28 oral heavy
leukoplakia is caused by epstein-barr
virus number 29 the tissue of origin of
Kaposi sarcoma is vascular number 30
ELISA - when compared to Western blot
technique is more sensitive unless
specific number 31 half-life of 3h IV in
plasma if it's ours number 32 prions are
infectious particles on the best killed
by sodium hydroxide that's it for
today's session guys keep on revising
the points all the best thank you

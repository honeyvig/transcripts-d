hi everyone thanks for joining this
session on accessing code in the cloud
with GitHub where we'll go over how to
clone a repo to your local machine with
Visual Studio
I'm starting off on the learning series
main repo page where I can see this
green code drop down button I'm going to
copy this https URL and then I'll go to
visual studio and click clone a
repository
here I'm going to paste the link and I
can decide where in my file system I
want the repository to live
by default Visual Studio groups all of
your clone repositories together in the
source slash repo folder of your user
Drive
I click clone and my repository begins
cloning
I know it was successful because I can
see the name of my repository in the
status bar and also in the get changes
window label
you may notice that there's a
notification Banner prompting me to
enter a username and email
this is a git configuration that adds
your name and email to each of the
commits or snapshots of code that you
push
it can be different from your GitHub or
Visual Studio account
also depending on your use case you may
need to adjust your username and email
per repository if for example you'd like
to push your code changes with your work
email or your personal email
we'll keep the checkbox for its set in
global.git config checked for now since
for this series we don't want to change
this information every time but you can
always go into the tools options get
settings to adjust this later
thanks for watching everyone

yeah hi guys good evening one and all
we'll wait for five minutes
meanwhile you can post your uh
stuff related to preparation preferably
no doubts and not doubts related to the
subject
so the rest everything like questions
confusions
everything you can post on the chat box
so that I'll try to address them
how are you first basically
how are you feeling what is happening
inside
don't ask me anything related to exam
post appointment or something a few
groups lots of things are happening in
many groups and I hope you are away from
those groups and focusing on preparation
I did we even if exam is postponed exam
is not postponed whatever it is
the the ultimate goal of an aspirant is
to focus on Preparation and read okay if
you are on revision mode
what whatever happens that is going to
be good for you at the end of the day
revision revision
if you are focusing on yes it's
wonderful your preparation is going
extraordinary
I want you to be active share your
feelings try to share your stress levels
I'll try to help you out in few things
okay so that we can make this uh session
basically as a stress breaker the main
mode of this session like probably every
alternate today I'll be coming on live
uh for few minutes maybe probably for 20
to 30 minutes so that I'll I'll
definitely create something a positive
impact on your brain and definitely
stress
of course Grant examination solving will
take time
you cannot if you want you can you can
skip it it will take time of course exam
will take time three hours it's must
there is no solution for such questions
don't worry about marks it's not time to
worry about uh marks or it's not time to
worry about scores okay how many days
are left over
how many days are left over
16. how many hours we are reading per
day maximum on an hour is maybe 10 hours
so 10 into 16 how many hours left over
for us 160 hours so don't expect some
Magics to be happened in this 160 hours
magic should be happened uh in the first
half of the preparation like probably
six months eight months you have started
the preparation 10 months you have
started the preparation few people are
reading from past two years magic should
happen there okay so now 160 hours no
Magics are going to happen Okay so
there's no point of breaking your head
so the point of this 160 hours or the 16
days is to how to make your preparation
more effective and how to end up with a
decent rank the goal is to end up with a
better rank or a decent rank okay don't
expect some extraordinary Magics to be
happened in this last couple of days and
let's try to be so logical uh come come
to the Practical world at least in the
16 days you have to come to the
Practical the more the time you spend
the more the revision you do the SMART
the preparation this last 16 days will
definitely give you some extra uh
extra Edge extra score maybe five marks
extra or six marks extra right
now it's not frustration uh it's not
basically frustration like a frustration
comes only when you are not able to make
things up to your expectations so that's
what I'm telling don't expect Magics to
happen so whenever you don't expect
extraordinary things to happen and just
go with the pace of uh the revision or
go with the pace of the preparation uh
using the day more effective and
compared to what you have done
previously then the frustration will
automatically drop down like frustration
comes only when you are not clear in
what you are doing or what for what
you're doing in such cases you'll get
frustration so I think that's not in a
perfect word like even I get frustrated
like this is this is the Ninth Batch
this is an eighth batch of MDS conquer I
have I I made my preparation for three
years so it's almost like 11 years
preparation so I'm reading everything
what you're doing I'm reading everything
because before I release a question
paper I have to check each and
everything before I take a class I have
to check each and everything so I don't
get frustrated sometimes I'm I'll just
go out of my control okay so maybe the
reasons are different like aspects are
different okay so and I should not use
the term frustrated for all this stuff
okay
so that's what like regularly we see we
see the people uh I mean we see the
students after the result or like we
talk with the people who are going to
attend the success maybe it may not be
like all of the people may not attend
the success meet but after interacting
with so many students on the day of
success meet or on after the result uh
like people who are very happy with the
result
or satisfactory with results a result
means always don't imagine that the
result will always come with a state
single digit or an all India single
digit don't expect such things uh
satisfaction can come at any rank few
people they may be satisfied with two
thousand dollar India or few people they
may be satisfied with one thousand or
three thousand I'm just telling that I
was talking to uh students after the
result and their families after the
result okay so the Gratitude call
profitably after the result or a message
gratitude message like in most of the
students who are happy with their ranks
or who has achieved the single digits or
the extraordinary extraordinary ranks or
gdcs and all these people uh
uh I mean like I have seen that coolness
and calmness in their preparation face
they don't don't overreact to the
situation that is the that is the most
required even I overreact to the
situation I'm telling like when I Was
preparing you can ask me why you have
taken three attempts because I overreact
to the situation
so now you have more margin of error 240
questions but when I was giving my
entrance examination we don't have that
margin of error we we our examination is
for 100 months 100 mcqs so we don't have
that margin of error like whenever
people overreact to the situation so
they're going to destroy that margin of
error and your rank will totally change
so that's what happened like my
preparation was decent uh at all the
phases but why I don't end up with the
good rank in first and second phases I
overreact to the situation I I
overreacted the situation I focus more
on doubts I focus more on doubt
clarification I focus more on uh
clearing the doubts of micro aspirants
I'm more active on social media we don't
have Instagram at the time but I'm more
active on Facebook I'm more active on
this whatsapps groups and everything
where anything like that is basic that
is the main reason why I spoiled my
preparation a lot so that is the reason
why I always show concern to to the
aspirants that be careful about your
preparation because I I'm okay with my
preparation during the first and second
run but why I spoiled uh I don't end up
with some something great which I Really
Deserve is
I'm going out of box unnecessary aspects
unnecessary stuff
okay so let's start the main motto of
this session ready I want you to back to
200 order of their decent decent fight
200 odd can give a decent fight from MDS
conquer to this neat examination which
is on March 1st as of now official date
I want you to back to energetic more
active more energetic
climax of a movie should always be
interesting here do you accept it or not
I hope like as an Indian we watch more
movies right
so climax that half an hour last half an
hour 20 minutes you expect some
extraordinary things to happen and end
up with a decent end right so this is
almost a climax you're almost you're
almost at the climax space so if you are
planning to give a great story after the
result let it be any rank maybe two
thousand three thousand four thousand or
five thousand because I still remember
the most happiest Frank till the day to
me uh the most happiest gratitude call
after the result till the day to me is a
rank a woman got 5500 ranks she has two
kids never thought of doing MDS right
now she's doing Endo in one of the
college she has a reservation I still
remember those words like after the
result not after the result after the
counseling
uh she called me she was continuously
crying on the phone uh and I was so
emotional on that day I was still
remember those days
she was continuously crying and finally
she told like uh enter my family my
illness they have decided I'm I'm fit
for nothing I'm fit for nothing but uh
finally I I don't know how I prepared
but I I don't know what I have done but
I have given my best and I end up with
some 4000 or 5000 odd rank which is a
very decent rank in my category and I
got an Indo seat now I am going to
college every day dressed up with an
apron and the same illus who has
degraded me now uh are scared to see me
now they're praising me now they're
they're proud of me okay so things in
the family just changes uh basing upon
uh
the position in the profession what we
takes us I'm very very happy for this
stuff so that that made me more
emotional compared to single digit ranks
uh where many of the students in the
past has it shared okay so what what I
strongly believe is rank is just a
number
you you your your number you I mean like
what you are expecting is going to be
different what others are expecting is
going to be different like the gratitude
uh the part will be same let it be a
5000 rank if she's happy uh I I'll be
happy okay let it be a rank rank 90. she
may not be happy because she's expecting
50 below if she end up with 90 she may
not be okay so so this is all fight what
we are going to do in the upcoming few
days is just for a number okay so number
is not going to determine the life
number May determine your call as number
May determine your department number May
determine your lifestyle in the upcoming
three years but number is not going to
determine your life in dentistry it's
you that's going to determine how
positive you are how good you are how
talkative you are how Innovative you are
these are not depend these factors are
not going to depend upon a number okay
if you get a good rank good seat or
extraordinary great even if you don't
end up with something extraordinary uh
beyond your expectations you can do
magics okay you can do magics right
because I have seen many of the best
example is my batchmet
we are a batch of six and I still
remember our state ranks were around
like 20 30 20 it's all like 20 20 30 or
the top three and followed by three
people are from management quarter and
the out of this six the best I mean as
of now who is making good money as of
now who's making uh making good practice
energetic is is is my bachelor who is
from management quota okay so rank is
going to just give you something okay
but rank is not about everything so
there are lots of things that you need
to learn and practice in the future okay
so my first few points is already posted
on the group
the most important points for this
upcoming 16 days okay we're already done
with the day so we are left here with 15
days okay the first and foremost thing
I'm going to tell what to be done in the
upcoming uh 11 days followed by what to
be done in the upcoming four days so
it's 11 plus 4 total 15. I hope this is
very very clear 11 plus 4 total 15 days
and of course the four last four days
you have to you have to break it into
three plus one means last one day your
goal should be different so before that
three days your goal should be different
and this 11 days your goal should be
different I hope this is clear 11 plus 3
plus 1 is it clear I'm not using any pen
or I'm not using anything I just want to
talk more interact with you more it's 11
plus 3 plus 1 total fifteen days last
one day goals are different okay last
Monday goals are different so 11 plus 3
14 days is the target
first and foremost thing I want you I
want a quick response from you
how many of you have
deactivated your Instagram and Facebook
accounts
how many of you have deactivated your
Instagram and Facebook this is the first
thing what we have taken today okay how
many of you have done it
please go and do it
please go and do it
please go and do it because this this
social media is destroying the
preparation what we used to prepare what
my first batch second batch students
used to prepare is totally different we
used to have more human interaction more
interaction should be more interaction
is there we used to talk frequently
every day I used to talk with every
student every day the first batch I
still remember we used to have 255
admissions the first batch I used to
talk with every student in a week every
student that is possible this is
destroying the human interaction we are
not talking we are searching we are not
talking with the mentor we are searching
everything we want to search on the
Google okay so I want every one of you
to deactivate your Instagram and
Facebook and I want everyone to I mean
probably telegram is not a biggest
source of uh exchange I want you to
deactivate your telegram groups nonsense
groups there okay deactivate your
Telegram
and make sure the third one is use your
Mobile and WhatsApp as minimal as
possible okay ask me probably half an
hour in the morning whenever you're
taking your lunch break it's not
mandatory that you have to back to for a
session maybe you should be active for a
live session but not for a regular
session don't mind even if you are not
active I'll be posting whatever I
thought of posting whenever I thought of
posting I'm going to post my notes I'm
going to post my voice notes and
everything so whenever you want you can
take it keep it half an hour in the
morning in the morning half preferably
when you are going for an afternoon
lunch okay you can keep your phone on
and check out your missed calls check
out your WhatsApp messages whatever that
is important go it whatever that's not
important ignore it so after 16 days you
can get back everything and similarly go
with the phone don't take your phones to
the offline centers don't take your
phones to the library don't keep your
phones because phone is the biggest
distraction in this 16 days okay so I
want you to follow these three
principles
Instagram Facebook logouts don't delete
the accounts they are important in the
future uh telegram you can uninstall now
and you can reinstall after after March
first exam use WhatsApp and mobile as
minimal as possible don't talk with
negative people please underline this
word people who are making your
preparation better people who talk to
you better people who motivate you only
talk with those people don't pick those
calls don't replay the messages of your
batchmates or your seniors or your
Juniors telling that exam will be
postponed that this this nonsense please
don't do any such things
Let It Be it's good if exam is postponed
if it's too good if it's not postponed
everything is good for us right so if
you are focusing on Preparation you are
on a good phase so don't expect some
Magics to be happened stick on to the
basics give exams on only the big
screens because your final exam is going
to be on a desktop with a high
resolution brightness and everything so
I want everyone who are giving exams
don't worry about scores scores are not
important final exam score is important
whatever you do now final exam score
will be the final exam score if you do
better the score will be better if you
do bad the score will be bad okay
it doesn't mean that if you if your
performance is suddenly increased in
this last few examinations it doesn't
mean you will get an extraordinary score
in the final exam do you accept this
principle okay for example the next few
marks I'm going to give very easy I'm
going to discuss the questions day
before the exam same questions I'm going
to give I'm going to improve your scores
it means you'll get a you'll get a great
scores in the final exam
do you accept this
it's not sensible it's not sensible I
can do that I'll do that don't worry but
it's not sensible so there's no point of
breaking your head for a score in the
examination the point is to understand
the exam understand the time management
okay understand the number of questions
to be attempted understand the questions
where you are going wrong understand the
concepts where you are going wrong so
don't compare MDS conquer mocks to other
test series or other institutes we has
the highest number of mock exams 25 is
very very high compared to any other
Institute so your GTS are 25 25 into 240
it's going to hit around 6000 mcqs six
thousand Concepts you are learning sir
you see what you are learning don't see
what you're scoring
is it clear see what you are learning
what you are understanding what you are
overcoming how you are uh how you are
trying to correct your mistakes try to
focus on those aspects because those
aspects are important see we never used
to talk about what uh someone is doing
in your in their net practice we never
see like we're actually
five centuries in the net practice we
don't see that we always talk about the
reality of a match we always talk about
the final match we don't talk about what
the players are doing in the net
practice right so similarly whatever
exams you are giving here is net
practice what is the purpose of net
practice to identify the mistakes learn
the concepts where you are going wrong
that is the purpose it's not about you
score extraordinary I score
extraordinary I am oh see I see like a
student's very scoring extraordinary
they're going to get ranks no I never
feel that happiness buzz after seeing
your results okay I'm just neutral
whether you score extraordinary whether
you score because I know the effect of
it
okay but make sure give exams and just
stop give exams in the laptop please try
to avoid phones at least now because
there will be lots of difference uh
giving an exam on a phone and giving an
exam on on this high-end screens okay so
please do make a note of it but don't
waste much of your time on doubts and
controversial questions basically okay
you check it off like the I can openly
say Okay Dental pulse is a very high
standard book okay uh nearest bhagwan is
a very very good good standard book but
of course there is some dental triplet
dentist there's so many books okay I'm
telling I'm openly telling PB books are
nothing in front of those books I'm
openly telling you know in those
standard books which are being followed
from past uh
like probably from 10 to 15 years I
think dentist has reached more than 20
years okay so these are high standard
books which are more than experience of
mine and Dentistry hardly how many years
of uh experience in dentistry I have is
very minimal compared to the experience
of these books these books are only not
able to solve the controversial
questions okay they give a different
answer these people are going to give a
different answer this year you want to
come you want to come and solve these
controversial questions
is is this logic working out for you or
not there's no point why you're coming
and tell me sir a b sir this book say
that book D what is the point they are
only not able to they're they're very
good teachers they're extraordinary
authors their books were extraordinary
so what is the point of digging the same
thing out
in which you or I cannot come to a
conclusion for a particular question so
this is all waste of time
this is a waste of time according to me
because I have seen myself and I have
seen many of the students who waste but
I see the the best rankers of the
conquer after the result they never post
a question they never they never do all
these things because they know revision
is the most important thing most
important thing like you take a
photograph you drop it on a group you
drop it to me you drop it to society you
drop it to pritisha waiting for the
result then after the discussion again
again how's time you're wasting for a
single concept
if you're really Keen about the question
learn I mean leave about the question
and options okay leave up the question
read the concept and move on for example
there is one question on a particular
thing the controversial thing different
different answers read the concept read
the entire topic and move on no need to
take a photograph edit it post to me
post to that it's waste of time now it's
waste of time all these things has to be
done in the first half of the
preparation not now now this is a peak
time that you keep on turning the pages
you keep on turning the
you keep on turning the volatile topics
volatile subjects this is how the smart
your preparation can be
right so I mean it's okay you can post
your doubts at any time we are ready to
help you out controversial questions
doubts try to avoid it because they're
going to save time and you can Implement
these times on revising the volatile
topics that's going to increase your
confidence and scores in the examination
and of course follow the group always
follow the group each and every voice
not each and every line that is posted
on the group is going to be very very
very very very very very very very
important okay and of course the game
plan is to trust yourself because you
are the hero of your
story and you're the hero of your movie
so
you have to trust yourself there is no
other goal that you have to trust and
you have to believe yourself okay right
so these are the few things that I
thought of discussing and coming to the
plan of 11 plus three plus one what is
this 11 plus 3 plus 1. so uh basically
uh I mean like most of you uh if you
have this list of things what I'm
listing out please try to follow them if
you don't have uh you can you can plan
according to the first and foremost
important things uh I mean it's
mandatory that every day two hours has
to be given to the volatile content
means content what I read today and
there are high chances on the third day
I don't remember I don't remember the
content properly so these are volatile
contents that can be avoided I don't
consider entire subject as a volatile
subject but I preferably consider There
Will Be Few topics few contents in a
particular subject which are more
volatile and which has to be repeated
again again and again do you accept that
volatile topics and volatile contents
will be there in every subject
right so every day two hours you can
keep for a volatile contents like 16
days you have 16 into 32 hours
exclusively for volatile contents one
thing is
you already worked on the volatile
content and if you already marked them
if you already prepared a notes on them
if you already prepared a checklist on
them you go with your own pathway no
need to come in my path there were few
category students at every level There
Will Be Few category students who are
always in in sort of that confusion
dilemma big question marks on their face
okay such category of students you can
open your PP books and do the volatile
content every day one hour one and half
hour you can do PP Books Okay because
all the volatile contents according to
me I have inserted in the pp Books Okay
you can do so my suggestion for every
one of you is every day one to one and a
half hour PP books and PV books is not a
very condensed book it is it is very
spacious book you can easily turn the
pages you can easily finish the things
quick revision is going to help you out
so every day one hour or one end of our
volatile contents are power playbooks
the second important thing every day one
hour repeats okay that you can go either
subject specific
subject specific can be done properly
from your dental pulse or that can be
earwise if you want to do earwise if you
have nearest bad one you can do earwise
or if you don't have nearest vadan if
you have dental pulse you can do subject
specific means every subject repeats
from 2017 to 2021 or 2022 you can do it
the previous papers are already inserted
into the uh like their incident in the
topic specific activities right
right so every day one hour PP books one
one and a half hour you can go with the
repeats and uh offline students as well
as pro-life students they have extra
stuff that is your prologue papers are
there your offline papers are there okay
right so I want you to do those papers
at least one one and a four per day
normal students they don't have the
access for these things okay you can
stick until your regular plan okay so
one one and a half hour for pro-live and
offline
one hour for power playbooks one hour
for repeats and one to one and a half
hour for previous mocks you have to
revise the previous mobs and that's what
my suggestion for all of you is don't
revise everything sir I want to see
every question keep on skip skip skip
now you're done with already 20
examinations 20 into it's all like five
thousand MC cases and five thousand
times if you skip
six hours will be done okay so it's not
it's it's pointless of revising each and
everything and I hope most of you have
bookmarked the things if your bookmark
the things go back and check the
bookmark things uh and wherever you feel
like a classification is required which
is there in the synopsis or some some
stuff is there and the synopsis part or
explanation part go back and check it
but make sure you try to revise these
mock exams
very frequently okay so one hour for
power playbooks one hour for repeats
either subject specific or earwise one
hour for your pro live and offline
papers and one hour for your mock
repeats and you can keep half an hour 40
minutes for your WhatsApp activity
whenever you have time you can go back
and check on your mobile data or your
Wi-Fi uh all the all the all the things
whatever I'm planning to discuss will be
displayed on your WhatsApp group and you
can check them randomly okay and make
sure the next one is no need to answer
your friend's doubts in the 16 days you
can if you want if you are very
concerned about clearing those doubts
and helping them you can do it after
March first not now okay no need now you
have to focus only on yourself
helping others yes good but not in this
not at the sacrifice of your 15 days
because I told you right 15 days into 10
you hardly have 150 hours in that uh is
there anyone to give 10 hours to your
friends
close let it be close friends 150 hours
are there 150 hours of your life is left
over is there anyone who is ready to
give 10 hours or 20 hours to your
friends to clear their doubts or to
clear the doubts on the group and
everything
I don't do that
I'm I'm very diplomatic I have lots of
humanity compared to many of you I know
that but I cannot sacrifice myself and I
cannot sacrifice myself and come out so
don't entertain those things in this in
this in this particular phase this
particular phase you should be very very
a route to yourself and you should be
very very tough to yourself so the
things will be on track and things will
be possible for you right so this is
what the plan PP books won and followed
by repeats two and followed by uh your
mock exams revision three followed by
your WhatsApp Activity 4 followed by
your pro live uh all these things uh
this is this is five so you can keep the
one one and a half hour for all these
activities and this turns around like
six to six and a half hours per day and
rest like I hope like most of you are
hitting that uh 12 to 13 hours per day I
hope like most of you are hitting that
so leftover will be left over will be
eight hours like if you do six hours for
this and leftover will be eight hours
eight hours you can go with your regular
plan
and try to focus more on the volatile
things and one more important thing is
revision is more important okay means
you're just seeing the things which are
already done seeing the things which are
already understanded seeing the things
which are already solved that is called
as revision you see something like you
you open General anatomy and you you
you're just trying to read out this
osteology the foraments and everything
this is the first time reading it's
going to be difficult if you're already
done twice or Thrice and if you're
revising it it is going to be smooth
it's going to be okay means there'll be
few areas you will be confused okay
since for example yesterday we were
discussing about this lip prints
classification
lip prints classification if you're
already done from PP books then it's
going to be revision it's not something
new so I strongly recommend you to focus
more on revision rather than reading a
new content someone some of your senior
or your friend called and told one book
that book is very extraordinary yeah
very good here means don't start new
things now
you can do you can do new single liners
means a single line or two or three
lines or four or five lines new lines
related to a particular topic okay don't
read new material don't read heavy new
materials I hope you got that difference
like the thin line of difference what
I'm telling don't read new materials
don't read new pages read new lines new
lines are okay single lines are okay new
diagrams are okay new questions are okay
means if something it is new it should
be less than less than in minutes maybe
five minutes something new good but most
of your time should be focused on
re-revising the things means already
done
now you are opening and trying to revise
the things okay maybe some
classifications maybe some numbers maybe
some Concepts confused let's say whether
it's going to shift to the DBA to the
left side or deviate to the opposite
side or deviate to the same side some
sort of confusion will be there not for
all for few people that's what I'm
telling like you read the slip Prince
classification but you are confused
between two and three or three and four
that confusion part we have to focus on
maybe Ellie's classification I'm more
confused between six and six and seven
I'm confused I want to see that so what
is this classification I know vertices I
know wins I know vertices but confusion
between two and three are confusion
between six and seven uh okay so I'm
going to see all those areas means
revising the things and I'm going to see
like uh I'm a bit confused about the pH
values I'm a bit confused about the
acid-base reaction I'm a bit confused
about the types of meningitis I am bit
confused about this volatile contents
like classification of your pharmacology
maybe anti-tubercular drugs questions
are coming I'm confused I don't remember
properly I'll go back and check it drug
interactions questions are coming from
so many years there is a PDF on your
oral surgery smart notes I'll go back
and check it
maybe I I feel like forensic I'm not
strong okay that five pages of pp book
synopsis I'll go back and check it maybe
Anatomy I'm a bit scared so it's not
going to be possible for you to do
everything so what I do I go back and
check those 15 pages of anatomy synopsis
which is present on your dental belts so
this is how you should plant
biochemistry I'll go back and check
those classifications and vitamins no
need to revise I can handle I I I'm not
losing questions on vitamins maybe I'm
losing questions more on uh the memory
based aspects of biochemistry like
classifications and all these things I'm
phobic towards them I'll go back and
check it
so this is how your plan should be maybe
you need to give more importance to
dental materials preferably the
impression materials impression
materials compositions impression
materials lots of things that you have
to make in order or maybe uh Jones of
flame I have to go back and check it
maybe a few things related to amalgam I
had to go back and check out few
classifications related to composite GIC
classification or maybe ortho
the few areas in our time I'm confused
few areas in prose time confused I don't
know what to revise you don't know what
other device go back to PP books or go
back to mock exams or go back to repeats
very simple if you don't know and if
you're not happy with your preparation
very simple open PP books and try to
just turn the pages open your mock exam
and try to read the question and answer
understand the question answer open the
repeats last five years preferably last
10 years preferably go back and check it
so this is how you should you should
focus on the preparation you have to do
something better which is going to
improve your score that is the ultimate
goal of you or me or any why why sir you
are conducting 25A exams
it's giving a giving 25 exams giving an
exam is difficult or preparing an exam
is difficult you tell me which is
difficult preparing a question paper is
difficult
adding an explanation is difficult
uploading in the software is difficult
or giving an exam is difficult okay so
so we are taking so much pain okay so in
order to prepare one question paper okay
so we are taking so much pain so it's so
painful for me uh particularly but it's
okay it's okay that because I have some
goals in my mind regarding this 25 mock
examinations because those are going to
help you out in your final exam I'm very
sure about that because you can see uh
your seniors reviews regarding the mock
examinations or there were few people
who are repeating here with MDS longer
they know the value of mock exams that
is the reason why I see few students
immediate examines they're going to go
finish it fast and they're going to come
out with a come out with the explanation
okay that's fine that's secondary so
these are the basic things like okay so
what you have to do in this upcoming 11
days and probably the last three days
what I'm telling the last four days
three plus one so last three plus one my
suggestion for you is uh you should not
get confused what to be done in the last
three days you should get prepared to
the last three days means last three
days you should sit in the say it and
uses you just turn the pages that's all
so don't keep heavy heavy books heavy
heavy things I have to do something in
the dental pulse volume three I have to
do something in a clinical uh dentist I
had to do something in Sharon I had to
do something in don't keep heavy heavy
books in front of you let's make the
preparation very cool and compost know
what to be done in the last three days
okay so you you keep your checklists on
you keep your checklist checklist what
to be done and everything because I'm
giving checklists regularly so you
decide like okay in this three days I
have to do these subjects preferably
more or these topics preferably more or
these contents preferably more maybe I
want you to stick on to yourself with
some markings don't carry the heavy
Dental pulse okay heavy animals because
almost three volumes it's very difficult
for you to handle so the less like is
the more of the comfort is preferably I
want you to be
got it less leggings and last three days
and last last day what to be done
maybe you need to do uh Anatomy for one
hour
maybe half an hour Anatomy half an hour
45 minutes of General Anatomy all those
uh stuff related given in the synopsis
maybe you need to do uh uh I mean like
pathology you need to do pharmacology
you need to do I think though I don't
think so microbiology is not very
important I mean you can handle because
microbiology we are vigorously exposing
you from all the sites maybe few areas
of orthoprost so uh maybe a few areas of
community
uh child psychology in pedo maybe
because lengthy case-based questions I
hope you are doing good extraordinary
are doing good but if you want to be
more accurate and more confident maybe
oral pathology oral medicine synopsis
has to be done external radiographic
techniques has to be done maybe diagram
based questions not required in the last
one day because you're more keen with
all those things maybe suturing
techniques classifications no need to
focus more on oral surgery you can skip
it general surgery you can skip it
maybe you need to focus more on general
medicine physiology biochemistry DM dad
which has to be done particularly that
eruption sequences and uh groups which
groups are seen in which particular
teeth all these are confusions
difference between left and right
maxillary mandible arcanines uh all
these things like a few things like you
you know that right so what your uh what
you feel difficult in da and what you
feel difficult in dhdh a quick glance of
DH may be a half an hour or one hour of
DH in the last one or two days and half
an hour one hour of Da biochemistry uh
Power playbooks part General Anatomy
synopsis part maybe a synopsis of
physiology in physiology like uh and you
need to have a quick glance about your
general medicine notes is whatever you
have done particularly the few things
that uh maybe heart sounds uh heartbeats
first sounds second third and fourth
sounds your ECGs your jvps uh maybe
romantic Universe your Duke's criterias
infective endocarditis all this stuff
related to CVS a few areas of CNS upper
motor Global lesions differences
nephrotic nephratic syndromes maybe
respiratory volumes capacitance all
Basics related to your asthma emergency
emergencies medical emergencies related
to your oral surgery and general
medicine so these are the things that
you have to give more importance uh
in the last one or two days so you
should get you should prepare to do you
should prepare uh in this in this first
10 days you should prepare what to be
done in the last three to four days the
three plus four or three plus one I was
telling right so and in the last one day
you should be very cool and compost okay
uh don't touch the things which you are
strong at
you're just solidly focus on the
volatile contents volatile Pharma
Anatomy biochemistry a few areas of far
uh Ortho maybe I don't I don't prefer to
go with water medicine Radiology in the
last day maybe I don't I don't go for
pedo I don't go for Indo I don't go for
operator maybe I will be focusing more
on dear I'll be focusing more on dadh
this this is how you should plan your
aerial view for the last one day
followed by the before three days don't
carry heavy heavy books don't tell that
I have to do something in this I have to
do something in that but if you want to
do be clear be clear with the checklist
I have done next one or I'll open that
book so don't keep 10 or 15 books around
you and don't imagine that you are going
to do all those books in the last four
days do you feel like you have done many
things from different different sources
right can you do all those things in the
last four days that's the biggest
question mark you cannot do it okay for
example no you cannot do it
so what my point is my point is very
clear so should be clear what to be done
in the last four days so your
preparation is going to be so effective
and that's going to improve your
confidence levels okay
so whenever you have a chance like uh
the mobile is the biggest source of
knowledge right your WhatsApp activities
lots of things are happening and your
group has lots of mcqs uh mock exams at
the topic specific are their subject
specific are that not the topic specific
are very simple like you hardly have 20
25 questions in each topic and for every
subject you have hardly eight or ten
topics so it's going to be hardly 160 to
200 McQ so you can just scroll keep on
scrolling like wherever you feel like
you're not clear with the concept just
check out the explanation if you're
clear just keep on moving the skip
button should be the next button next
button should be used most commonly and
wherever you feel like doubt keep or
keep a keep a bookmark and wherever you
feel like a point to be added keep it
keep it like wherever you feel like okay
something I need to check this
classification add it in the bookmark
you can you can add it in the notes okay
so this is all from my side I don't want
to eat your brains again and again
telling the same thing so you can just
follow these things uh the next
important aspect is every alternate
today we'll have a 15 to 20 minutes meet
like this on uh
on the June preferably because I don't
want to disturb your Instagrams and
Facebooks but all these irritating stuff
for this leftover days maybe I'll be
I'll be available on June and preferably
I'll try to keep this uh recorded
version on the YouTube okay just to make
it more accessible to you guys not to
Target all the others because your rank
your achievement is more important for
me rather than helping out someone who's
following my YouTube okay right guys
it's clear
we'll talk about exam centers
don't worry anything in specific any any
anything in specific don't worry about
scores
now let it be more genuine don't worry
about scores worry about revising the
things in in the most smartest way
follow the suggestions given on the
group prepare the checklist try to
revise as much as you can give your best
net practice before you go to the final
exam before you play in the final exam
give the neck practice properly here
Magics will happen in the final exam not
here
you know that Magics are going to happen
only on the day of exam
if you if you if you feel some
extraordinary things to happen you want
great scores here or you want great
scores in the final exam definitely you
want great scores in the final exam so
Magics are going to happen in the
examination Hall
if you are properly being trained and
revised here don't don't don't expect
some extraordinary scores in this exams
I really want to give a tough papers not
to decrease your confidence levels to
make your final exam more easy
hope we are done with two parts of
discussion right 2022 part one and part
two how many of you feel like uh the
questions are tough
I'm not telling that the exam will be
easy I'm telling that the majority of
the situations the questions will be
easy because you're trained properly
because you're you're doing good you're
working hard you have good knowledge
that is why the question is easy
question can be easy only if you're
working hard if you have that knowledge
only the question will be easy without
knowledge question cannot be easy so you
decide that the question is easy means
you are you're working good your hard
work is determining is making a
difficult question also easy okay so I
mean like that's what I'm telling I want
to I want to train you hard
so you will feel more comfortable in the
exam okay and make sure there were few
people who are not able to manage the
time properly okay so I want I'm just
giving you caution be careful about that
be careful practice properly give exam
properly don't worry about scores at
least you have to learn the time
management here because most of the
students are able to solve only 200 to
210 or sometimes 220 not able to hit the
204 file exam not all I'm just telling
it's a five percentage I I am just
hearing this only from uh three to five
percentage of students who are not able
to do because I was asking them the
reason these are not practiced your mock
exams at the Mark I used to go back and
submit the mock exam see the question
answer part I don't have such time so
they give such reasons it's okay because
we cannot change the preparation of
someone as many uh other personal
responsibilities right so like for
example a mother who is having two kids
need to manage the house and the clinic
we cannot force her to prepare for
12 to 15 hours it's not possible maybe
students who are active interns does not
have responsibilities maybe people in
the offline centers study rooms yes of
course we can stretch our time and we
can focus on Preparation but preparation
cannot be same for all of us okay right
so if you have any doubts we can discuss
them
any questions here
any questions
one day
the examination center is in the same
city you can go on the same day if it is
you need to travel from your village or
your town to
town to the examination center down to
examination center city then it's better
you take it you take a proper transport
a day before the exam and overnight you
stay in a nearby
the nearby good area maybe a relative's
home or any hotel or any any area
then we can do it negative markings are
too much in GT's uh which is just giving
anxiety so there's a video on YouTube
last session was on negative marketing
how to handle negative marketing and
everything I have discussed clearly I've
given four or five principles go back
and check that
you can just ping me on on the WhatsApp
I'll send you the link of the video you
can check it I have already discussed
negative Mark in the last session
anything more guys
you should you should be cool yeah
when you're cool and compost the
functioning of the brain will be more
effective do it do you
do you accept this your brain will be
more effective when you are tense
anxious or your brain is going to be
more effective when you're cool and
compost
so try to be cool and complex it's going
to be difficult but my suggestion is
tell yourself that you should tell
yourself 100 times you cannot do
extraordinary things here
okay you have to control you have to
control your brain you have to control
your emotions you have to control your
frustrations basically the today's
session was started with frustration
word by someone I don't remember the
exact name of the student it's a more
frustrated more anxious more more no we
know this we know this mixed feelings
that every one of us have even I have
from what he said so you should know how
to control it okay so that is how the
life is going to bring
keep some good songs keep keep some
headsets walk for at least like 15 to 20
minutes a day don't don't ideally sit
for hours talk with your mother talk
with your good friends who are not from
Dental fraternity okay people talk with
the people in the rental fraternity you
talk with your friends so you may have
some engineering ID friends okay good
friends okay just go back and just talk
for just 10 or 15 minutes or talk with
your mother or father who is positive or
just trying to hear uh either the MDS
conquer mentors voice notes that's also
going to give you some sort of
equilibrium State okay so like I'd used
to watch
I used to hear songs I used to go to I'm
not devotional I never go to temples but
during the preparation phase I used to
go to Temples it's not I I want to
worship God and ask the god to give a
good rank but uh I used to feel that
positive vibes in the temple that sounds
and everything I used to feel that
positive so every day if morning 15
minutes an hour evening 15 minutes I
used to go to Temple and whenever I feel
frustrated I used to start with the
easiest subject and whenever I feel
frustrated I used to hear some music
make sure you take some B complex okay
so I mean like maybe uh like if you're
feeling uh
ulcers tensed maybe antioxidants vitamin
C or B complex
suggested and I randomly suggest people
also to take energy drinks in the last
few days to to make use of your day more
effective like few people uh because of
XYZ factors or insomnia tense tension
and all these things they may not have a
proper sleep to make their day more more
energetic you can take this energy
drinks available in the market which are
filled with kef and few people they take
they ask you to take either cold coffee
or a hot coffee but it's okay if you
don't have the habit of coffee because I
don't take coffees I don't have a habit
of taking a coffee but whenever I want
to be more energetic in the session what
I'd regularly do is I take a caffeine
caffeine shot uh probably like a Red
Bull or a string or a monster So Many
Drinks nowadays they're available filled
with lots of caffeine to make you more
active so if you don't have a habit of
taking a coffee then it's not a bad call
to take caffeine for this few days two
weeks it's okay no problem
preferably before you go to exam uh
maybe a shot of Kevin is going to make
you more active
anything more guys
shall we close the session for today
maybe I'll catch you on 15th again
shall we I need your response
okay cello then let's study well if you
need anything you can personally ping me
I'm open to talk with you but I I just
want to prepare something that's going
to make your preparation more effective
I'm ready to talk with you also not an
issue
always with you take care take care guys
study well take care of your health
don't drink anything outside don't drink
anything water anything don't drink
outside whenever you're going out
preferably have a sealed water you take
your regular water you take hot water
don't think don't drink anything
don't eat anything new also okay so it's
going to make your stomach upset or if
you're getting favor for two or three
days now in this last 14 days it is not
at all accepted it's going to hurt your
preparation so much and you feel bad for
that okay so be careful about your water
particularly and be careful about your
surroundings be careful about your food
these are the three ways where there is
high chance that you may get some viral
infection so be careful in this 14 days
take some vitamin capsules uh take some
coconut water take some buttermilk uh
make your body more hydrated study
better do it I'm with you we are with
you we are working so so hard along with
you and I strongly believe that most of
you are doing extraordinary beyond your
limitations and you will be blessed with
some great result or a great number like
we always prefer the great number we
will rock yes we will rock for sure this
year we are going to rock and very very
happy with your preparation bye take
care love you always
bye-bye

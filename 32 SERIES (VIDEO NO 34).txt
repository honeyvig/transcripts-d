hello everyone this is dr. aamil from
team MDS conquer in this video we are
going to discuss 32 important points
from the subject orthodontics point
number one there's links diagnostic
setup is the one which helps to
visualize treatment results
point number two to present at birth are
called natal tooth
point number three tooth erupted during
the first month of postnatal life are
called neonatal teeth point number four
tooth erupted during second or third
month of postnatal life is called pre
erupted tooth number five they do to
whose development has been considered
valid for assessment of skeletal
maturity is Magna black cannon number
six in classifying the occlusion of a
patient with permanent molar loss the
important additional observation to
reinforce the initial evaluation is k9
relationship number seven in anatomic
cross-bite smooth closure is seen number
eight in functional cross bite jerky
momentum centric relation to centric
occlusion is seen number nine payin a
technique is used in diagnosis of
untrusting point number ten endochondral
ossification Ackerson cranial base
ethmoid hyoid incus and stapes bones
member 11 intramembranous ossification
occurs in maxilla nasal bone pair adults
zygoma oma lacrimal and zygomatic bones
number 12 both endochondral and
intramembranous ossification is seen in
occipital
Pinole and temporal bones number 13
oral ectoderm is of stratified squamous
epithelium number 14 lateral sulcus is
the only group to extend on to the
buccal side number 15 in primary
dentition the arches become stable at 3
to 4 years number 16 physiological
spacings in maxilla is of 0 to 8 mm that
is 4 mm in each quadrant
whereas in mandible it is 1 to 7 mm that
is 3 mm in each quadrant number 18 the
term simian space is given by Baum the
term primate space is given by Bako and
the term anthropoid space is given by
Foster and Hamilton number 21 maxillary
central diastema of 2 mm we close
spontaneously point number 22 bone
seaming agent for bone resorption by
disrupting osteoclast ik activity is
bisphosphonates number twenty three
primary cartilage has interstitial
growth potential and this pressure
tolerant number 24 primary cartilages
flexible nonvascular and non class
calcified and doesn't require a nutrient
membrane covering for survival number 25
server system theory of growth was given
by Petrovic
number 26 according to birthstone center
of resistance lies at 66% of route
length from apex number 27 the tooth
moment that produces uniform stresses in
period on chemise translation number 28
amount of force for intrusion is 10 to
20 grams number 29 extrusion and
rotation it is 35 to 60 grams number 30
amount of force for root up writing is
50 200 grams
number 31 amount of forceful tipping is
35 to 60 grams whereas for translation
is 70 to 120 grams that's it for today's
session guys all the points discussed in
this video are very important from neat
and aims point of view so keep on
revising them well all the best thank
you

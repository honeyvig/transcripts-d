please answer in the comment section
below and we'll update the correct
answer in the pin comment you can pause
the video give it a thought and answer
in the comment section
so moving on
now we'll move to create a project
so first we will create a folder for a
project
and for that we will
create a folder in
python projects
and my name is
automate WhatsApp
using chat jbd
okay
and inside this will open the command
prompt
and open our ID
that is we want to automate the mode
step using Python and with the help of
chat Deputy we won't write the code on
our own we will ask charitivity to
automate it
we will create the file and name it as
main.ty
and now we'll move to chat jpd
and ask chat jbt
to write a code to send messages through
WhatsApp using Python and the pivot kit
Library
so we will give a command
send message
through
WhatsApp using
Python and
pivot kit
let's see but
response to us and we have also created
the automate WhatsApp using python video
I will just Link in the I button you can
check that out
and we'll see what
chat jpt tells us okay
[Music]
country code message
minutes yeah it could work
and first you need to install the
pivotkit library
by running weapons to private kit in
your terminal or command prompt okay
replace Target phone number with the
Target phone number you want to send the
message to country code with the country
code of the Target phone number message
with the message you want to send r with
the RN 24 hour format and you want to
send message and minute with the minute
you want to send the message okay for
example
yeah okay
all right so we'll copy this code
and
paste
in our ID
but before that
first you need to install the pivot kit
library and for that you can go to the
command prompt and write the command
pip
e install space
pivot kit and press enter
it states that the requirement is
already satisfied as I have already
installed this module and you can
install it by writing the simple command
and you will get it installed and if you
face any error installing it just
comment down
and would be very happy to resolve your
queries
Okay so
as chat GPT States we will just enter
the
things it want from us so it's asking
the
Target phone number and the country code
without plus sign
okay
so here we'll just
write all the things but as you can see
it has also given us an example
to see
and work on the code
so here
we'll just clear it
I will write the phone number to whom I
want to send the message
so it would be
and I would just blur this number so you
guys
won't be able to see okay
and here
will just
add the country code
and that is without plus sign
okay
so my country code is
you can search it that is I live in
India
and the message I want to send to Ms
hello
how are you
and now
we'll set the
RN minute so the current time is 15 14.
set
16. okay
we'll save this
and run it
so it says that the country code is
let me sing
so I'll just
copy the error and give it to chat jbd
as we are taking the help of chat
Jeopardy in this video
so he has given us the code so we'll
just provide the error to him let's see
but it states if it's not able
to resolve this then we will resolve it
[Music]
country code whether in the phone number
you're trying to send okay
yes and the country code is now I'm
going to send the message correctly you
need to make sure
okay
um one two three four five six seven
eight nine
yeah mentioned
in the question right now provide that
phone number is this and the country
code is nine one okay
you need to make sure the country code
is prefixed to the phone number like
this
two three four five six seven eight nine
uh
okay we don't have to make it a string
yeah now
we will turn it again
okay it's a string only
so I will write the phone number again
yes
three
okay now we'll see
and
what I will do
I will write the country code here we'll
save this
and the time is 15 17 now so we'll just
turn it to 15 18.
save this and run it
so our code has been executed
successfully that is in 20 seconds
WhatsApp will open and after 15 seconds
message will be delivered
so we just have to see that
we have enter the time as 15 18. is the
seconds
available for
the code to get executed yeah
it has opened the WhatsApp
and it will take time as my WhatsApp has
loads of chats and contacts
yeah I have to scan it
I don't think
it would be a less we have reached the
15 18.
you have scanned it
let's see if it would deliver the
message or not
hence we have to change the time
so we just have to wait for 15 seconds
let's see
okay
just stop the terminal
and run it again
4 15 21 so we'll
save this and run it again
so it states that in 85 seconds WhatsApp
will open and after 15 seconds message
will be delivered
so we'll get fast forwarded here
so we are still waiting
let's see and it will open the WhatsApp
okay it states that the phone number
shared by URL is invalid
okay I'll just check the phone number
again
[Music]
okay I entered the wrong phone number
sorry guys
so I will just update the time again
and it would be 15 22. will make it fast
we'll run this
okay let's say that the call time must
be greater than so we'll at 15 23 7.
we will make the
time is 15 27.
save it and run it
okay States that's in 40 seconds
WhatsApp will open and after 15 seconds
message will be delivered
it has opened the WhatsApp
and it has started the chat
okay it has
written the
and we have send it to hello how are you

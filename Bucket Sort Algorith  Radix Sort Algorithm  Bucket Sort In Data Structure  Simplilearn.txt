hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be discussing the bucket sort algorithm
in data structures but before we begin
make sure that you have subscribed to
our youtube channel and don't forget to
hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
at first we will understand what exactly
is a bucket sort algorithm next we will
understand the working principles of
bucket shot algorithm followed by that
we will look at the pseudo code of
bucket sort algorithm next we will
understand the bucket sort algorithms
complexities
then we will compare the bucket sort
algorithm with other existing sorting
algorithms finally we will wind up the
session by learning the various
applications of packets or algorithms so
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with our
first concept that is what exactly is a
bucket sort algorithm
so the bucket sorted algorithm divides
the unsorted array into several groups
known as buckets so each bucket is
sorted using any suitable sorting
algorithm or recursively applying the
same packet sort algorithm
i know it it's a little complicated to
understand so let's go through an
example
so on my screen we have an example of an
array consisting of numerical elements
that is 12 6 37 29 11 35 21 and 22
now we will create some buckets with
different ranges
so here we have different buckets
ranging from 0 to 7
8 to 15 16 to 23 24 to 31 and finally
the last bucket with range 32 to 39
so 6 will be stored in the first packet
followed by that 11 and 12 will be
stored in the second bucket followed by
that we have 21 and 22 stored in the
third bucket followed by that we have 29
in the fourth bucket and finally the
last two elements which are 37 and 35
stored in the last bucket
in the next stage all the elements are
sorted according to an order that might
be ascending or descending in our case
we have the ascending order so the final
result will be 6 11 12 21 22 29 35 and
37
so this is how the bucket sort algorithm
works in real time now the next topic
that is working off a bucket sort
algorithm in a detailed way
so now we know the briefing of a bucket
sort algorithm now let's learn the
working of bucket shot algorithm in
depth
suppose we have an array consisting of
decimal values or floating values as the
input so the first element is 0.47
next we have 0.39 0.23
0.55 0.29 0.41
0.59 and finally 0.31
then we will create an array of size 10
and store 0 in each block
and each block of an array is used as a
bucket for sorting the elements
next we have step two
insert the elements into buckets from
the array and all elements are inserted
as per the range of the bucket
buckets ranging from 0 to 1
1 to 2
2 to 3 up to n minus 1 to n here n is
the number of elements in an array so
for our example 0.23 will be multiplied
by 10
which is the size of an array and that
gives us 2.3 approximately equal to 2 so
finally we will insert 0.23 into the
bucket number 2.
in exact we will insert other elements
into other respective buckets
followed by that we have step 3
elements of each bucket are sorted using
the stable sorting algorithms
and finally the step 4 in step 4 all the
sorted elements of each bucket will be
gathered and represented in the form of
an array as sudo code is an informal
programming description that does not
require any strict programming language
syntax similarly we will understand it
effortlessly so in the pseudo code first
we will create n empty packets
next we will insert all the array
elements into buckets by multiplying the
size of an array we have to keep doing
this for every array element as we
understood this in working of the bucket
sort algorithm
after that we have to sort individual
buckets using insertion sort and finally
we will concatenate all the sorted
buckets next we will learn about the
complexities of bucket sort algorithm
first we will see about time complexity
so talking about the time complexity we
usually have three cases to summarize
the time complexity so first we have the
best case
so that the best case is o of n plus k
next we have the average case that is o
of n into n and finally we have the
worst case that is o of n
here n is the total number of elements
to be sorted and k is the number of
packets
so let us understand all the three cases
one by one so first we have the best
case
so the best case occurs when all the
elements are uniformly distributed in
the bucket with an equal number of
elements in each bucket if insertion
sort is used to sort the bucket sort
algorithm then overall time complexity
is o of n plus k
o of n complexity is for making the
buckets and o of k complexity is for
sorting all the elements after
understanding the best case now we will
see how the worst case occurs in the
bucket sort algorithm the worst case
occurs when there are elements of close
range in the array they are likely to be
placed in the same bucket
it makes the complexity depend on the
sorting algorithm used to sort the
elements of the buckets complexity
becomes worse when all the elements are
in reverse order and if insertion sort
is used for sorting then time complexity
becomes o of n into n and lastly
we will learn how the average case
occurs in a bucket sort algorithm the
average case occurs when the elements
are randomly distributed in the array it
occurs even when the elements are
distributed in uniform way bucket sorts
run at the linear time
the average case holds true until the
sum of bucket sort sizes is linear and
in the total number of elements
next we will see about the space
complexity
so the space complexity of all the
buckets or algorithms is o of n plus k
lastly we have stability so talking
about stability so yes the bucket sort
algorithm is stable
after understanding the complexity of
packet sort algorithm now we will
compare the bucket sort algorithm with
other algorithms
so first we will compare the counting
sort algorithm
bucket sort can be worked as a
generalization of counting sort
algorithm and if each bucket has size 1
then the bucket sort degenerates to
counting 0.
the variable size of bucket sort
algorithm allows it to use o of n memory
instead of o of m memory where m stands
for the distinct value that gives
counting sort o of n plus one worst case
behavior
next we will compare the buckets or
algorithm with quick sort
bucket sort with two buckets is a
practical version of the quick sort
where the pivot value always selects the
median value of the value range another
meaning of choosing the pivot in quick
sort such as a randomly selected pivot
makes it more resistant to clustering it
in the input distribution
after that we have the merge sort
the n-way merge sort algorithm starts by
distributing the list into n-sub-list
and sorting each one then the sub-list
created by merge sort have overlapping
ranges and cannot be recombined by a
simple concatenation bucket sort
lastly we have one more sorting
algorithm that is radix sort for
comparison
top down radix sort can be a particular
case of packet sort where both range of
values and the number of buckets has
contained the power of two
this approach can accelerate the scatter
phase since we only need to examine each
element's prefix of bit representation
to determine a bucket
at last we have one more topic to learn
that is the applications of packets or
algorithm
the bucket sort algorithm consists of
two main applications
first by using bucket set algorithm
input is uniformly distributed on the
range and second by using bucket sort
algorithm there are floating point
values
now let us go through a practical
demonstration of bucket sort algorithm
now on my screen we have an example for
bucket sort algorithm so we will begin
with the header files followed by that
we will define a function namely bucket
sort algo
this particular function is to implement
a bucket sort algorithm in the functions
argument there will be an array namely
arr and a variable num which will store
the number of elements in an array after
that we will define two counter
variables which are i and j and declare
one more array namely array1 with the
same size of an arr array
so this particular second array will be
used for displaying all the elements in
the array 1 we will have a for loop
which will run from index 0 to the
entire size of an array and for this
array we will use the variable i as the
counter variable
we will have another for loop to print
all the repeated numbers with frequency
in an array
we will run another follow from index 0
to the last element of both the arrays
and elements of array and array 1 will
assign to arr array
now we will exec from both the loops and
now we will enter into the main function
where we will declare an array namely
array with the size of 100 and two
variables which are num and i next we
will ask the user to enter several
elements of an array using printf
function
and now the user will enter
number of elements and we will scan that
using the scanf function
now we will ask the user to enter the
elements of an array using printf
function and the entered elements will
be scanned using the scanf function
and next we will print a before sorting
and an array after sorting using for
loops by calling the packet sort algo
function and in this function we will
pass the name of an array that is an
array and the size of an array that is
num
now
let us try to execute this program and
see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed now let us try to
enter the number of elements that is
five now let us enter all the five
elements
two three
one four and five
so the array before sorting was two
three one and four five then the array
got sorted using packet sort algorithm
and the resultant array is one two three
four and five in ascending order
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on bucket sort algorithm if

topics covered in this session or if you

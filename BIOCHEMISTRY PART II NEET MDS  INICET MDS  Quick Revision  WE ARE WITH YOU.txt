hi everyone this is dr saithi team mds
conquer
so let's have a quick revision of your
biochemistry protein metabolism
so if you see these are the elemental
composition of proteins
where they are where it is constituted
by five major elements that is carbon
hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur
so the composition is quite important so
exactly the numerical value it might be
asked so just have a look of this
so amino acids are nothing but they're
organic compounds which consists of
two functional groups that is amino and
carboxyl
okay so amino group is basic while as
carboxyl group is acidic in nature okay
so
this is regarding the simple
introduction so coming to the protein
structure so what is primary what is
secondary what is circular and what is
quaternary
okay so secondary is like a helix and
chains of polypeptide chains are with
tertiary and the complex of the protein
molecule is with the
quaternary ok so various functions of
the protein if you see they are called
as a
working horses right so why because they
have
very good functions exhibited so see you
can see all the functions
that they provide structural components
they
help in movement of the muscles they
store the nutrients they carry the
essential
substances throughout the body they
regulate the body metabolism
okay and they catalyze the biochemical
reactions as well as recognize and also
destroy the foreign
bodies okay so these are the important
functions
next what are the essential and
non-essential
so this is quite important okay so i
think
you know it so just give a good glance
to this
next based on the structure again
it is again divided as aliphatic
aromatic acidic
basic hydroxylic sulphur containing an
amidic dick amide or medic and acidity
okay so if you see here the names
which comes under aliphatic are all
these okay so at times
if they want to post a memory based
question though definitely they can ask
from here
so even have a look of the
classification based on the atomic
structure and based on the composition
okay and again based on non polar and
polar groups negatively and positively
charged so this is one more
classification so even have a look of
this
and the metabolic fate so what is what
comes under
ketogenic and what comes under
glucogenic at what comes under both
so ketogenic or lysine and leucine
whereas both is tryptophan
threonine phenylalanine tyrosine and
isoleucine whereas glucogenic comes like
all the others comes with
glucogenic so this is the metabolic fate
okay
so this is important non-protein amino
acids with their respective functions
so even if you have knowledge regarding
this well and good or is just give a
glance to it okay so just give a quick
glance to it
okay so next this there is a
process called as transamination and
de-amination
okay which is again quite important so
if you see this chart it is pretty clear
and self-explanatory
okay so transamination there is
trans-amination that is transfer of
amino group one
from an amino acid to a keto acid so
that is called as a transamination
okay and it is again mediated by the so
called enzymes which are nothing but the
transaminases which are previously were
called as a amino transferases okay
so very important all amino acids except
lysine
threonine proline and hydroxyplorin
participate in transamination so except
these four
all the others participate okay so these
are the important points and only two
namely aspartate transaminase and alan
and transaminase make a significant
contribution to the transamination
okay so these are the enzymes and what
all amino acids accept like exceptions
are quite important right so
make the note of it next oxidative
d amination where is there is liberation
of free ammonia
coupled with oxygen so from the amine
group there is liberation of the
free ammonia okay so in the process of
transamination so we have discussed
right so there is
amino i mean the transfer occurs but
in oxidative deamination there is
finally liberation of the
free ammonia so the glutamate is only
amino acid that
undergoes oxidative deamination
to significantly release or liberate
free ammonia for urea synthesis
so even in the previous chart if you see
i
see this is a glutamate right so
glutamate undergoes oxidative demination
in order to liberate free ammonia so as
to
participate in urea synthesis okay and
glutamate dehydrogenase is a zinc
containing
mitochondrial enzyme okay so these are
the important points so even you can
have a look of this
next non-oxidative deamination examples
so here it's quite pretty clear so what
are all the examples for non-oxidative
deamination
so just make a note of all these ok all
the important points
point to be noted are all these points
so just give a glance to all these
important points which are being noted
here next
we will discuss one by one so glycine
this is the overview of glycine
metabolism okay
so so main thing
related to glycine which is quite
important is a metabolic disorders of
glycine
so that is glycineuria and primary
hyperoxaluria
okay so this is very important because
they can ask us applied aspects
okay so where the gla if you see glycine
urea there is serum glycine
concentration is normal
but very high amount of it is being
excreted in urine so urea means
it has been excreted in urine it is
because of defective renal
reabsorption when there is defective
renal reabsorption glycine urea occurs
and it is characterized by
increased tendency of formation of
oxalate renal stones okay whereas the
urinary
oxalate level is normal in this patient
so these are the true or false
statements that can be asked
so give a glance to it next primary
hyperloxal urea so here there is
increased urinary oxalate resulting
resulting in oxalate stones okay so here
there is oxalate stones okay so this is
regarding that so primary is hypoxaleria
is
due to the defect in glycine transminase
okay so it was asked once so what it is
because of what
it is because of defecting glycine
transaminase
next coming to the creatinine okay
so just give a chat look to the
metabolism of the creatine so it's
pretty clear what are the reactions that
occur
so just give a look to this okay so the
creatine is again converted to creatine
phosphate
okay so just have a look of this next
phenyl phenylene and tyrosine so
very very important so this chart is
very very important
okay and also the synthesis of
phenylalanine
is also important so sorry synthesis of
tyrosine from
phenylalanine okay so that is quite
important so if there is a block here
then it results in phenylkit
ketone urea okay so phenylalanine and
tyrosine are interrelated to each other
so just
give a good grip or just have a good
glance to this
chart okay have a grip of the metabolism
related to both these
so if you see here next is the thyrosin
so tyrosine is actually important for
the thyroid
synthesis of thyroid hormones so
okay and
albinism is due to the lack of synthesis
of melanin and it is a
autosomal recessive disorder okay so
tyrosine again important for
melanin pigmentation and melanin
i mean synthesis of pigment of melanin
also so if there is a
problem with tyrosine obviously it can
result in
lack of this pigment that is melanin
okay so how it is being sick
produced it's pretty clearly given in
this chart so just have a look of that
as well okay so these are the various
catecholamines
biosynthesis so phenylalanine converted
to tyrosine
that is converted to l dopa to dopamine
to norepinephrine and epinephrine so the
series of reactions and the enzymes
involved quite important
okay so next disorders of tyrosine
metabolism the very very important area
according to me
is this ok yes you need to have an idea
of the
i mean the metabolism the chart and the
series of reactions
but the disorders related to them is the
applied aspect
so that's the reason they play like they
take a more important i feel so just
have a look of
all the disorders related to tyrosine
metabolism so exactly
how the question can be asked is which
enzyme
is being blocked or what reaction is
being affected in phenylketonuria then
you have to go for this that is
phenolinin hydroxylase okay so all these
diseases
and the respective enzymes and the
respective
reactions are quite important even
alkeptonuria is again quite important
so do give a good glance to this okay so
next coming to the tryptophan so
tryptophan
so if you see this is the overview of
tryptophan
okay so hat nups disease okay it is
characterized by
low plasma levels of tryptophan and
other neutral amino acids and their
elevated
urinary excretion okay so this is
regarding tryptophan which is quite
important for the nad
okay so that is nicotinic acid
ribonucleotide
antinucleotide so
so just have a look of this just give a
glance no need to
get into each and everything for this
just what exactly is the importance of
that okay so if you see they are
important tryptophan is necessary for
the coenzymes of niacin
right so they can ask you where all the
what is uh
important amino acid for the coenzymes
of niacin then you have to go for
tryptophan okay so like that it's quite
important next this is a serotonin
melatonin pathway so melanin is
different from melatonin
okay so melanin is related to tyrosine
now it is melatonin which is related to
the
tryptophan again okay so that is
different so it is involved melatonin is
involved in circadian rhythms right so
this is
quite important so have a look of this
as well
next system so this is a
metabolism so i mean the sulfur
containing amino acids is a system right
so
this is the overall view of it okay
next the branch amino acids so
marple syrup maple syrup maple syrup
urine disease okay so
this is a metabolic disorder of a branch
chain amino acids
okay so here the urine smells to be like
a maple syrup or a burnt sugar hence the
name is given like that
okay so this is due to the defect in the
enzyme branch of chain
alpha keto acid dehydrogenase even that
is quite important have a look
next lysin cartilage plays a very
important role in fatty acid oxidation
okay so this is just a summary of lysine
metabolism and cartilage
so just the series of this so have a
look of this just give a glance to it
glutathione okay so glutathione is a
tripeptide
that contains glutamate okay next acetyl
n-acetyl glutamate and aminobutyric acid
so again these are very important so
glutamate
is decarboxylated to gaba which is
present mostly in the
brain so this is an important line again
and glutamate is also present in
clotting factors
two seven nine and ten as gamma carboxy
glutamate and it is again involved in
coagulation so which of the following in
gets involved in coagulation then you
have to go for
glutamate so glutathione is a
tripeptide which contains glutamate okay
so
just give a glance to it next serine the
over
review of the sarin metabolism just have
an idea
so synthesis of essential non-essential
amino acids
so this really gives so what ah the
non-essential amino acids and what
from where are they synthesized from so
this gives you the brief review of
everything next the urea cycle
everything kept in one chart all the
important points a urea cycle mainly
occurs in the liver
and the urea is being eliminated by the
kidney okay so this
fumarate forms the link with the tca
cycle
next urea cycle is also called as
ornithine cycle or creps
henselt cycle and the enzymes which are
present in mitochondria
that is carbonyl phosphatase and
ornithine trans
uh trans carbomylase whereas enzymes
which are present in cytosol are argino
succinates agnostic
synthase and arginase okay so many times
the questions are asked in and around
this particular
flow chart or the urea cycle the cycle
which is particularly given here so just
i think you are very well aware of it so
these are the various
questions of the various important areas
so arjuna's is activated by
carbon dioxide and manganese and
ornithine and lysine
compete with arginine by competitive
inhibition okay arginase is mostly found
in the liver so all these are just the
important
points taken from your textbook note
them down then the disease is related
okay so what
enzyme deficiency causes what
or the which respective disease so hyper
ammonia type one
is because of deficiency of carbonyl
phosphate synthesis one
deficiency of ornithine trans carbamil
is hyper ammonia type 2
adreno succinate synthesis deficiency
causes citrullinemia
okay citrulline anemia next argeno
succinate
enzyme deficiency causes argenosuccinic
acid urine arginase
defect or deficiency causes
hyperagineemia okay so
again this is quite important so
everything related to urea cycle is put
forward here
have a look so here the atps
and all that okay so that's it regarding
urea cycle so with this
we have given a very quick glance to the
protein metabolism
okay and the urea cycle so important
areas are the diseases related to the
respective amino acids
and the little glands of the metabolism
of the various amino acids and very
important area
is the urea cycle and what are the
essential and non-essential amino acids
and the names of the amino acids and the
classification of the amino acids
so that's enough so just have a look of
this okay so this is regarding the
quick revision of the protein metabolism
okay thank you

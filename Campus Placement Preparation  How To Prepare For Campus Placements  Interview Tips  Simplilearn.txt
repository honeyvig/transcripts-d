research about companies that are going

you desire to work for

glassdoor to get an idea about the
interview process and questions asked in
the previous interviews
the next point to keep in mind is to
ensure that you have practiced well on
your aptitude skills because every
interview process begins with an
aptitude test
aptitude tests contain questions based
on logical reasoning
quantitative ability verbal skills
domain knowledge and psychometric
analysis
the motive behind conducting these
aptitude tests is to gauge the intellect
of the candidate this test is the first
hurdle that you have to clear before
reaching the next round in the placement
drive so it is crucial to polish your
aptitude skills first hand

these skills refer to technical
knowledge of the domain that you want to
work in

so we strongly recommend you to start
working on your heart skills a year
before the placement season arrives

your future so it's crucial to prepare

in technical interviews recruiters test
your technical competency
it is advised that you go through the
previous year's interview questions to
get an understanding of what you are in

type of questions that they ask

knowledge and confidence is vital to
nail technical interviews

part of your hiring process

are not and the answers to these can be
tricky and do more harm than good you

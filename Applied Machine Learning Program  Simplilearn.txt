welcome to simply learn's applied
machine learning course
let's start with why one should select
simply learn
you have come to the right place for
over a decade simply learn focused on
digital economy skills
now simply learn has become world's
number one online bootcamp with unique
curriculum that combines live virtual
classes self-paced learning content
interactive labs and real-time
scenario-based projects
let's learn what is applied machine
learning
so what is applied machine learning
applied machine learning is the
implementation of machine learning to a
particular data related problem
it uses techniques and theories of
mathematics statistics computer science
domain knowledge and information science
to build the model
machine learning can be used in any
situation where there are probabilistic
elements to a problem but it is
especially useful when manipulating and
analyzing large amounts of statistically
generated data let's now look at some of
the benefits of applied machine learning
its usage can be seen in a variety of
fields including healthcare banking as
well as science and technology
second it allows users to handle a large
amount of data
it gives machines the ability to learn
allowing them to make decisions and
self-improve algorithms
it is capable of managing and processing
any form of data that normal systems
can't
the demand for applied machine learning
is rapidly increasing machine learning
is expected to continue to grow
significantly in the future
this is primarily because these data
scientists and their applied skills have
resulted in great success for companies
around the world
there are many companies around the
globe which are hiring machine learning
experts by the dozens here are a few
names accenture amazon apple
facebook google intel paypal microsoft
twitter ibm
let's look into what this program has
for you
the blended learning program is a
combination of self-paced learning
content live virtual classes and
significant exercises that ensures
practical and industry aligned learning
the program features a right mix of
theory case studies integrated labs and
hands-on projects
class sizes are limited to foster
maximum interaction
let's walk through the learning path
so who can take this program the one who
aspires to be an applied machine
learning expert and has an understanding
of programming in any of the popular
languages programmers software
developers analysts learning enthusiasts
anyone from engineering discipline can
be a data scientist for instance there
is an associate programmer who recently
graduated as an engineer and has decided
to become an applied machine learning
expert he is going to become an applied
machine learning expert after completing
this master program

introduction to machine learning this
phase will provide you a program
overview and a basic understanding about
data science machine learning and
applications of machine learning this
will be an instructor-led training
session along with self-paced learning
content
next is the data wrangling this session
will help you implement data extraction
data wrangling and perform missing value
treatment
third lesson is the feature engineering
you will learn various feature
engineering techniques such as data
imputation scaling binning and grouping
operations
next comes the exploratory data analysis
covering data exploration and various
types of plots such as box and whisker
plots bar chart column chart line chart
scatter chart and kd plot
next is the feature selection this
lesson will cover techniques for
dimensionality reduction need for factor
analysis pca eigenvalues eigenvectors
and lda
the sixth lesson is supervised learning
regression and classification which will
enable you to use algorithms in
supervised learning and various
regression and classification algorithms
the seventh lesson is the decision trees
and random forest which will enable you
to use decision tree classifier and
random forest
the eighth lesson is the unsupervised
learning which includes unsupervised
learning process flow real-life
scenarios and different algorithms in
unsupervised learning
k means clustering includes different
distance measures use cases in python
elbow or scree plot and hierarchical
clustering
let's go through the components provided
in this course
simply learn also provides downloadable
pdf files of the lessons to refer to as
required
with the trainer to guide you and answer
your queries you will get a practical
knowledge of data science
there are more than 100 questions to
help you measure your understanding of
the concepts learned from the course
and to cap it all you will also work on
lesson end projects and course end
projects to develop your machine
learning skills by solving real-life
industry based projects
so what are you waiting for

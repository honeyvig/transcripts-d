I can't recommend this highly enough I
love this thing I use the extension and
for years and I'm very happy that this
is now in the Box I'm gonna show you one
of my favorite new features that we are
putting into Visual Studio this one
started its life as a an extension it's
now coming into Visual Studio let me
demonstrate that so let's say I want to
add a file to my project you know I can
right click
go down to add
a new item and that gives me this
dialogue but what if I go into tools
options here and click preview feature
flag here and what I want to search for
is enable quick add so now when I right
click and say add new item or kick Ctrl
shift a it's the same thing I get this
little dialogue up instead so I can
still click on this link that's shown as
well that says show all templates which
gives me that experience that I'm used
to
but I want to get the simplified view we
call it the quick add dialog and so in
here I can just type a file name so a
name dot Cs and that's what it does it
just gives me the internal class and and
this actually respects if I have uh how
how my namespace rules are in my editor
config or in my settings and it will do
the right thing it uses the the
templates behind the scenes but it's
it's a little bit more clever than that
so control shift a again for add new
item to bring it back up let's type
something a little bit more interesting
let's what if we create two files what
if I create create a client Cs and
iclient.cs I just comma separated them
and I now have those two files but check
this out iclient is an interface whereas
client is a class so the quick ad method
or dialog is able to understand that I
client that naming pattern should match
an interface template and then give me
that but I can also click create folders
so I'm going to create a folder here
called folder and you can name it
whatever you want and just end it with a
forward slash hit enter
and now you have an empty folder I could
also have gone in and said okay what if
I do some sub directories here and then
end with file.css
so I can create subfolders I can create
files in those folders and again I can
comma separate these to create multiples
this is in the preview behind a feature
flag so you saw how I went into tools
Options under preview features and
enabled this feature

hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about bubble sort its complete
logic and how to program and implement
it in real time let us take a look at
the agenda for today's discussion
and meanwhile be kind enough to get
subscribed to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit that bell icon to
never miss an update from simply learn
first we will begin with understanding
what is bubble sort algorithm
next we will understand the working
procedure of bubble sort algorithm after
that we will understand the pseudo code
of bubble sort algorithm later we will
learn the optimized bubble sort
algorithm and next we will see some
varieties of bubble sort algorithms
after that we will understand the
complexities of the bubble sort
algorithm and finally we can wind up the
session with application of bubble sort
algorithm i hope the agenda was clear
hoping we are good to go let's get
started with our first topic
let's try to understand what is a
bubblesoft algorithm
the bubble sort algorithm is one of the
fundamental and simplest forms of
algorithm used to sort a collection of
elements the collection of elements can
be either a set of numbers or characters
the control iterates through a sequence
of numeric or character type elements in
the bubble sort algorithm and rearranges
them into ascending or descending order
the bubble sort algorithm rearranges one
element at a time
the bubble sort algorithm is also known
as the sinking algorithm
here we have some random distributed
elements which are 30
10
20
50 and 40 and after performing the
bubble sort algorithm all the elements
are sorted as 10
20 40 and 50.
so how is it done
we will see in the next segment where we
will understand the working
terminologies of bubble sort algorithm
the bubble sort algorithm will not get
implemented on the entire array in one
go instead it compares two adjacent
pairs of elements in an array if the
elements are not in the correct order
then they are swapped so the largest of
the two moves towards the right and this
process continues until the most
significant element or bubble is moved
towards the highest position
after the first process is finished the
search for the next most significant
object starts
and the swapping continues until the
whole array is in correct order this
process is employed when you want to
arrange the elements in ascending order
to understand the logic in a better way
let's go through an example
the example on my screen consists of
five elements according to the bubble
sort algorithm logic we need four
iterations to sort all the elements in
the ascending order or in descending
order
the elements in the array are as follows
they are 3
8 4 2 and 12. so in this array the index
begins with 0 and ends with 4
and each time the bubble sort algorithm
goes through the data element list and
it is known as a pass
let us analyze the total number of
comparisons required to sort the array
in the correct order according to the
formula
if n is the total number of elements in
an array then the total number of
comparisons needed to sort the entire
array can be calculated by a simple
formula shown on my screen
that is
n
is equals to n minus 1
so in this scenario we need 5 minus 1
that is 4 comparisons or passes to sort
the entire array in the first pass there
are four steps
let us select the first two elements
that is three and eight according to the
requirement we need to sort this array
in the ascending order hence when we
compare three and eight clearly we get
three as the least number so we do not
need to swap them
next is the step two comparing the
second and third elements which are
eight and 4. here we need to swap these
two elements because
8 is always greater than 4 and it
requires placing the elements in the
ascending order now moving ahead we have
step 3 moving on to the third and fourth
elements which are eight and two and
here again we need to swap eight with
two because eight is greater than two
and in the step four we have we have the
last elements which are eight and twelve
there is no need to swap because 8 is
already less than 12 so you can see it
clearly so now we enter into pass 2 and
in pass 2 we need 3 steps
so the first step in the second pass let
us select the first two elements which
are three and four
no swapping is necessary as they are
already in order
next we have step two
in step two we need to select the
elements two and four as you can see two
is always less than four so there is no
swapping required
next we have step three in step three we
need to compare the elements four and
eight and here we may not need any
switching because 4 is already less than
8. now here you can see that we are not
comparing 8 and 12 because the last
element is already sorted now we have
come to the last pass
and here there is only one step the step
is to compare the first two elements 2
and 3 and then swap them as 3 is greater
than 2. now the array is finally sorted
and we do not need to do any more
comparisons
after understanding the working process
of the bubble sort algorithm we will see
its pseudo code in this pseudo code
there is a function named as bubble sort
the bubble sort function includes an
array of collections of sortable
elements let us consider n as the length
of the array after that we have to
repeat comparisons for the first element
to the last element of the array if the
first element is greater than its next
consecutive element then we must swap
both the elements and place them
correctly we do not need to switch after
closing this repeated statement and
getting out of the loop this bubble sort
function will end after understanding
the pseudo code of the bubble sort
algorithm let's learn about the
optimized bubble sort algorithm so we
can optimize the algorithms in a loop by
programming it to avoid the comparison
at n minus 1 position after every
iteration since the nth element is
already sorted in the previous iteration
more generally
more than one element may be placed in
their final position on a single pass
all the elements after the last swap are
sorted in every pass and do not need to
be rechecked optimized bubble sort
algorithm allows skipping over many
elements this results in a worst case
that is 50 percent improvement in
comparison count and adds little
complexity because of the new code sub
sums the swapped variable
next we will learn variations of the
bubble sort algorithm so there are two
variations of the bubble sort algorithm
they are
odd even sort and cocktail shaker so odd
even sort is a parallel version of
bubble sword for the message passing
system
whereas cocktail shaker is a sort of
bi-directional bubble sort that first
goes from beginning to the end and ends
to the beginning after knowing the
variation of the bubble sort algorithm
now we will see the complexity of bubble
sort algorithm
so the best case of the bubble sort
algorithm is big o of n where n is the
number of elements being sorted and
worst and average cases of the bubble
set algorithm are big o of n into n and
lastly the space complexity of the
bubble sort algorithm is big of 1.
here n is the number of data elements
being sorted let us understand when this
complexity occurs the best case of
bubble sort algorithm is o of n which
occurs at all the data elements in an
array are already sorted here we have an
example with some data elements in an
array which are already sorted that is
10 20 30 40 and 50.
next talking about the average and worst
case the worst case and average case of
the bubble set algorithm is o of n to
the power 2 that is n squared or n into
n it occurs when all the data elements
in an array are reversely sorted again
we have an example that consists of data
elements that are reversely sorted that
are 50 40 30 20 and 10 in an array
lastly we have space complexity the
space complexity of bubble sort
algorithm is o of 1 because only one
additional variable is required to
implement bubble sort algorithm that is
temporary variable we came to the last
topic where we will understand four main
applications of bubble sort algorithm
first application of bubble sort
algorithm states that this sorting
technique is used to sort the elements
in a specific order the bubble sort
algorithm uses less storage and is the
second application of bubble sort
algorithm third the real life
application states that the bubble sort
algorithm is used to start the students
based on their height in a line
lastly bubble sort is used to create a
stack pile up the elements based on
their height
after covering all the bubble sort
algorithm topics we will now see a
practical demonstration of bubble sort
algorithm
now on my screen we have an example for
bubble sort algorithm so let us get
started with the code in this code at
the first position we have some header
files that is standard input output
standard library etc
after that we will define the main
function in the main function we will
declare an array with maximum size of
50. so here you can see that we have the
first array variable that size is 50.
size will be defined with declaration
only because we cannot change the array
size in the runtime after that we will
declare four variables that is a
b
num and temp
none variable will store the number of
elements of an array after that we will
ask the user how many elements are
required for the array using printf
function
so here is the printf function where we
will be asking the
user to enter the number of elements in
an array and the user will enter the
elements and this will be done using
scanf function then finally we will
print all the elements that the user
wants to store in an array using another
printf function
we will have three loops firstly there
will be a loop from the first element to
the last element of the array so this is
the first for loop we need then second
the for loop will use the variable a for
the rotation purpose as we know rotation
equal to number of elements minus 1 so
it will make a loop from index 0 to
number minus 1
the last loop is used for how many
passes will be required for the
implementation and we already pass
equally to the number of elements minus
number of rotations minus 1. so there is
the loop from index 0 to number minus a
minus 1 then there will be the if
condition stating that if the first
element of an array at index b is
greater than the element at the index b
plus 1 then we will make swap then we
will come out of the loop and we will
print all the array elements after
performing the bubble sort algorithm now
let's quickly execute this program and
see the output
so you can see the program got
successfully executed now let us enter
the number of elements let me choose 5.
now let us enter the elements in a
random order
so this was the array input 3 2
4 1 and 5 and here after executing the
bubble sort algorithm we have the sorted
array that is one two three four and
five
and with that we have come to an end of

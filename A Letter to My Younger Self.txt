>> Letter to my younger self.
Dear Lil Pinoe, I know you're a
little shy and
uncomfortable right now.
You think that you have to play
for the men's team because you
don't see any women playing
football on the TV.
At times, the pain of missing
out will make you want to
give up on your dream.
I know you feel like you're
fighting against the world.
[FOREIGN].
I know what you're thinking.
Is it all worth it?
I'm writing this letter
to tell you that it is.
You're just about to
come out of your shell.
Embrace that feeling,
trust your instincts.
You will go places and become
things you never dreamed of.
You are bold, you are strong,
you are a warrior.
You'll eventually wear that jersey,
and with it will come
some amazing highs,
and the respect of your teammates.
You will make history.
Get yourself locked and loaded kid,
and always believe in your game.

mindset
lots of confusions and finally I have
cracked the rank and I have done my
masters from Vishnu Dental College in
Android department and further we have
started this MDS conquer long ago in
2010

orientation batch that you are going to
be the Ninth Batch of MDS conquer okay

below nine nine is a luckiest number for
me okay so this is the Ninth Batch of
MDS conquer and hardly welcome each and
every one of you for this lovely
interactive session which is going to be
more informative and it's going to uh
like it's going to be more information
it's going to give lots of information
related to Dentistry around the globe
for which you are accessible
first and foremost thing I want to
congratulate each and every one of you
for clearing your final year and
entering into internship and of course
now a doctorate tag is being added which
is uh strongly below that is something a
magical feeling that every one of us has
on the day of result so first of all
congratulations yes you have did it you
have did it
do you accept this you you did it
something or you are forcefully done
with your exams or you have done
something
I I just need a two-way communication at
least in the initial house you you feel
like you did something in videos or
forcefully you're done you joined things
were done first year second year kovit
came covet has eaten two two years more
okay and uh lots of things happen mixed
feelings examples pointed pre-born lots
of things are happening because of this
uh 19 okay I'm talking about 9 and 19 is
more important throughout the world okay
so something you have done it okay so
fine my first question is
my first question all of you whether
it's an intern or a repeater my first
question is what is real success and
what is real achievement whenever when
you're in final year
Liberty first year second year third
year and fourth year what do you feel uh
is a real achievement
in a final year I mean finally maybe
once you are posted to eight departments
brushing here and there eight eight
records lots of Staff lots of work lots
of patients what do you feel
is a success what do you feel is an
achievement in a final year
someone is selling clearing eight
subjects extraordinary that's the best
answer the best answer for me clearing
the quota clearing the final year
subjects okay uh I mean like uh maybe
there may be three or maybe five
percentage of students will be really
extraordinary I'm not talking about
those five percentage of students I'm
talking on behalf of 95 percentage of
students means 95 students in a 100
batch their main success and achievement
in a final year is to clear the exams
clear the theory and practical and jump
into internship this is this is what I I
vote for this is 95 percent of students
will believe that they want to clear
no we we are always so busy we are
always so busy and packed with this
pandemic one followed by eight
departments forces from everywhere lots
of quarters lots of Records to be done
there's lots of unnecessary stuff to be
done in a final year okay we are least
bothered about learning in finally here
we are least bothered about managing the
patient patient management we are least
bothered we are more bothered about
other things because they are going to
give you the past tag that you are going
to enter into internship this is do you
accept this or not
do you accept this this is a strong gut
feeling when I was them that is 10 years
back and what do you accept this what
I'm telling is
to accept this yes few people are
telling SS yes
okay so my next question for you my next
question for you
what is real success and achievement in
an internship now finally okay finally
here you are everyone are so packed
record science people will screw you up
you have lots of tensions then I'll ask
you the next question you are interns
you have started your internship now
tell me what is the real success and
real achievement you are planning an
internship
confidence in our judgment getting into
ads
building the passion towards Dentistry
yes good very good passion towards the
Dentistry confidence in your judgment
like whatever you are opting you should
be confident in telling that to your
parents or anyone exposure to more
patients very good planning for MD is
very good
any other not to depend upon professors
for the clinical judgment yes of course
internship is something like internship
the basic definition of internship is
it's a transfer period
from
for a baby it's a transfer period it's a
growing phase where you are how to take
your own judgments how to take your own
calls in handling the patients without
taking uh help of others like maybe
without without direct supervision or
indirect supervision if you if you can
handle the things better then you can go
and survive outside learning everything
by ourselves yes wonderful okay gaining
knowledge by exposure yes very good very
good I really appreciate you
learning something from each and every
case learning learning internship is a
face of learning but most of us
including me when I was an intern 10
years back including my batch meds we
used to have that particular Norm about
internship internship
is enjoyment
internship is entertainment
internship
so many teachers professors has
irritated you that's a time that you
have to take revenge on them
okay internship is a phase of
entertainment enjoyment trips tours
parties this is what I really am really
hearing from so many so many of the
students in prison generation like we
used to have this particular crowd of
people we used to have during our phase
also but after 10 years I feel that
percentage of people who has this Norm
of internship is lots of enjoyment
enjoyment entertain just relax enjoy
enjoy the college take the Revenge
whatever you want you can plan your
revenge something like you see all
movies right first half hero will suffer
second half hero will take revenge that
is how the story will be concluded so
many of of the people nowadays has this
Norm
so okay so I mean like I mean like few
of you may may jump into uh the next
part PG what is success and uh uh real
achievement in PG so once you enter into
PG you have some Norms in your brain
okay so what pages do around you they do
cases they they work hard not all but
most of them they want to learn
something so it's always learning what I
say is it's always internship is
learning PG is learning and post PG
means after PG also you should start
learning implementing the things opening
the clinic working under someone working
in the college there are many many
things they go on so what I strongly
believe is life is always a face of
moving to the next level okay you move
from first year to second year second
year to third year third year to final
year now your interns probably once you
crack rank or do something you may go to
abroad or you may move to PG first year
second year third year then you come out
into Market to practice this is what
life is do you accept this this is what
life of a doctor is particularly
doctor's life will be like this only let
it be an mbbs background let it be a BDS
background
whatever it is whatever it is your
background will be like this only okay
means you need to move yourself from one
level to other level Keep On Moving
yes do you accept it I want I wanted to
wear reciprocation so that we will will
try to be more interactive in the next
few hours okay I want I want more
response
more response we have more than 175
crowd which is a very decent crowd okay
for an online session which hasn't have
a recorded option too so you can watch
whenever you want yes I want that lovely
response okay so what iPhone is doing
what iPhone Apple company is doing they
have started some file followed by six
seven eight nine ten eleven or twelve
thirteen or Fourteen and fifteen is
coming right means every year what they
are doing every year what they're doing
they're upgrading it they're updating it
so proficient Dentistry is always
updating okay he's always updating
whenever you see it is always updating
and if you only have the habit of
updating yourself only then you can
survive here only then you can server
here okay without updating habit you
want to get settled down you cannot even
after opening the PKS Clinic after
having a having the highest position in
dentistry you should get upgraded with
the knowledge you should get it upgraded
with the system around your society
around you
to accept this or not you always need an
upgrading you want to stick onto the
same phone for 10 to 15 years or you
want to keep on changing your phone
changing your clothes new clothes new
phone new books
so we always love to get upgraded so
finally so before starting the session
going in detail into the session how are
you feeling now
how are you feeling now I'm asking in
dentistry I'm asking dentists now few of
you are planning to prepare for exam few
of you are in internship few of you may
be fine the final year or you may done
your internship long back so what is
your feeling about
Dentistry or about your position
even I am dentist I'll tell my feeling
foreign
or about your position in dentistry what
do you feel now you have multiple
options okay
you have you know all these emotions
excited confused
happy and proud
confused
come on come on throw the answers
confused confused about life worried
lost
confused
worried tensed
confused yes lovely so this is what the
answer I expected and this class or this
session is going to give a total clarity
about this confusion okay basic the
reason why I have thrown this question
is I want you to see I want you to tell
confused if you are if you have a
Clarity then there's no point of taking
this particular session so I want every
one of you uh I'll give a beautiful
clarity about Dentistry so I was in
dentistry okay so I was in dentistry so
I have started my journey in 2007 2008
so completed my internship in 2012 and
2013. so I am 10 years ahead of you
simply telling I'm 10 years ahead of you
in dentistry and 10 years ahead of you
and if you ask me what is my present
feeling about my profession or Dentistry
what I can tell is I am very very very
very very very very very happy and very
very very very very very very proud and
I made my parents as well as my family
proud and trust me if you ask me the
same question in 2012 2013 probably 10
years back when I was an intern
now you have an answer that you are
telling that you are confused you are
sad your your afraid or some XYZ but my
answer is
none I don't have any feelings
I don't have any feelings
please don't write anything here
just a second because it will be
recorded also
I just need five minutes someone has
written something on my pad and it will
be
foreign
I'm so headache
okay so I Cannot drop that that is the
reason why
have so many softwares working to
project this as a live okay anyway
Supriya if you can remove that please
try to remove that if you have any
option to remove that whatever you have
written on my screen please try to
remember that because I'm not able to
see any options from my side okay anyway
so now you have the freedom of telling
that you have if you have a feeling okay
but
10 years back I don't have the right to
tell my tell my feelings also because
I'm so confused about Dentistry I'm so I
mean like I don't have an answer I don't
have any feelings about Dentistry
because we don't have this lots of
internet source like if you open YouTube
and see lots of stuff is there about
Dentistry but now we long back to any
aspect we don't have that so whatever my
seniors are telling I used to follow
whatever my teachers are telling I used
to follow once I'm done with my exam my
senior is going to tell something I used
to follow
followed by few days other seniors want
to tell and I used to follow this is
what uh my pattern of approach towards
the Dentistry so finally what I can tell
you is I have learned so much about
dentistry in the last 10 years and I
learned only from my mistakes so I have
done so many mistakes in dentistry and I
learned from all my mistakes so I
finally decided to tell my story okay so
let's start my stories very exciting it
is most often like I can consider this
as KZ of part one and part two or you
can consider it as bahubali part one and
part two so interesting lots of twist
central banks are there climax will be
extraordinary okay trust me you're going
to enjoy the story so shall I start the
story I want you to be active
responded back to so active damn active
should be very fast here
you are 5G kids okay fifth generation
your 5G kids here you have to sew fast
right very good so finally so coming to
UC level I'm very good student at a ug
level okay I used to score well read
well because I don't have so many
friends so books are my friends I used
to sit in the library I used to read a
lot a lot a lot a lot and finally
a fine layer out and results came and I
got distinction very happy so next day
immediately one of my senior I met my
senior who is who you always guide to me
he's also a Topper so he used to guide
me and he told me to start the
preparation immediately without wasting
any time because he is the one who has
got the best rank uh when they were
giving the entrance and right now he's
done with Endo from CDC from a very good
GDC so he started me srikanth let's
start the preparation without wasting
any time so immediately I bought all the
books and everything necessary so I have
started my preparation
so once one person is starting the
preparation in a libraries reading very
seriously what is going to happen
everyone everyone are going to see him
okay so everyone has an eye on me my
batchmates my junior is also very
interested on me my seniors so
interested on me so keep people keep on
coming and giving me some suggestions
okay so everyone used to come and give
my suggestions I have decided to get
into MDS which is suggested by my senior
but finally I came out with different
different plans
so I came out with a different plan okay
so one of my senior told uh why to
prepare now why you are so hurry you can
take one year Gap
I started I bought my books I joined a
coaching Center okay then my senior one
more senior Twitter and come on let's
enjoy take break okay so let's join a
clinic one year you work in a clinic
you'll learn so many things okay then
you can think of whether you want to do
MDS or not so then what what happened
again one senior camps a given
suggestion I thought okay let's join in
the clinic so I joined in the clinic
I joined in the clinic I started working
the work is going on going on I have
created my preparation
but I have given the exam I have given
the exam but I quitted my preparation
because my senior told I have started
the preparation why my senior taught I
have quitted the preparation why
my senior turn
so once I start working with a very good
Clinic our days are going on going on I
used to have few of my seniors working
in the same Clinic after doing their MDS
okay and one of my senior who has done
with MDS he was sitting with me and he's
telling me srikant now you are not to be
here you are very talented you should be
in USA or you should be in Canada or you
should be somewhere
I thought that is true I realized that
that is the truth he's telling true and
I was feeling like that kgf movie like
that since I am feeling so energetic and
I felt like yes let's go to USC why I'm
going to why I'm planning for USA
my senior told why I have started the
preparation my senior told why I quoted
the preparation my senior told
why I thought of starting the practice
joining a clinic my senior to everything
my senior taught I don't take any
decisions my seniors so finally my
senior told relax and start your journey
to USA
again plan a shifted to plan B Plan B
shifted to plan C and finally I have
opened Google and I have opened Facebook
okay I have seen my seniors who are
going to I have seen beautiful
photographs like this Lots about
Dentistry so I was so excited so few of
you are telling that so excited about
Dentistry this is what excitement in the
Dentistry till the date I was never
excited about Dentistry okay I was
excited seeing all these photographs and
started my journey to USA
Okay so
after three months
now it's an interval Bank
can you guess what has happened
come on come on
if you already know my story no I don't
want you to answer okay can you guess
what has happened
yeah of course interval bang means
you'll have it that is for sure
again senior
of course seniors will be there
throughout your life don't worry every
place you will have a senior once you
enter into any Department you will have
a senior or a PC guiding you
okay so after lots lots of waiting
again plan has changed
plan has changed okay so one more senior
told okay I I realized myself that
I'm not fit for USA because I'm not
financially sure so so strong because I
told I asked my father about this he
said no impossible how can you go for
USA I cannot even spend a flight ticket
for you to go to USC impossible I said
like so I came into reality
then I went to my home and my seniors
again told me sir Ray you have to open
Clinic no you have hardly two clinics in
your hometown you are very talented
distinction candidate in the final year
very energetic talker okay let's open a
clinic
you can easily grab that you he asked me
uh your for where is your father
basically okay my father is past 35
years he's in the same same Hometown
well your father will have lots of
circle open a clinic
then I thought of
opening a clinic
then I thought of opening again my
father said no I don't have money for
the two or three likes so then
then the twist then the twist came now
the twist is this
finally
so tell me what is the twist here
what is the twist here
yes yes yes perfectly right okay it's
not my marriage my girlfriend's marriage
was over
okay she was waiting how how long she
will wait okay how long your videos girl
can wait hardly she will wait for one to
two years I thought of preparing for
entrance I joined a clinic then I
thought of going for USA then I thought
of opening a clinic finally
she said bye bye and I was into
depression so the next level is
I need to come back in the second half
right so it's an interval bank so
I have a plan
so all these depressions and everything
has eaten away one one and a fear two
years of time and I have restarted my
preparation cracked the entrance
joined MDS
started so many things because I was so
frustrated I want to be successful
because as you are not successful people
will not consider you as a human being
itself live about if you are if you are
failure you are not human being
according to the society this is a true
nature of a society Society only talks
with the people who are successful
Society talks with the people who are
doing good only Society will not ask
anything or will not talk with anyone
who is not successful or who were
nowhere on the screen
trust me it can be any level you can see
any politician who is who who's long
back doing extraordinary for example
almost ruled for 15 out of 15 more than
15 years now he's nothing until he wins
he's nothing so this is the true nature
of the society so none of my batchmates
none of them has considered me as a
human also so finally
I decided okay I want to prove I want to
prove I have talent okay distinction
candidate will definitely have a talent
I I decided so finally I have clicked
the restart button reboot button
this I I now I decided I don't want my
senior to suggest me I don't want my
parent to suggest me I don't want any of
my friend to suggest me I know what I am
good at I know what I can do I know
everything about me because the best
person to know about you is you the most
important person for you in your life is
you you know so some of you may tell
that my father my mother my brother okay
please underline the word in every word
you are telling my my means you are
coming first then your father or your
mother is going to come so this is a
true reality I started
after lots of lots of lots of
difficulties and failures I restarted
the things
basically I thought to open a single
chair clinic in my hometown if my father
tell us on that day I used to have a
single chair or double chair clinic in
my hometown
in my hometown hardly we have some five
or six clinics in my hometown okay so I
thought I planned for this
my parents did not accept it my friends
did not accept it none of them accepted
it so finally after a hard work of six
years completed my PG in indoor
department and God has planned something
extraordinary for me and my journey is
like this
so till the date in the last eight years
I have trained more than 10 to 12 000
students in a right direction I tried my
best I tried my best 10 to 12 000
students and I have students throughout
the country from Gemma and Kashmir to
Kerala Assam money everywhere I have
students I'm very happy for that I'm
very happy for that and finally this is
what my clinic is okay so I thought of
opening a single chair Clinic
in a village in my Village but I have
opened a clinic in the capital city of
my state
and
and my clinic is the largest microscopic
dental clinic in the entire country
India's largest microscopic dental
clinic we have six microscopes attached
to every chair
and we are doing very extraordinary no
no it's very simple because if I used to
follow my friend or someone XYZ maybe I
may be somewhere I may be somewhere I
may be happy to I I'm not I'm not
bothering about my seniors or someone I
may be happy to but after lots of
failures by the citations given by the
people what I decided is I decided very
simple that I need to write my own diary
your story has to be written by you not
someone okay so then the realization
came then I started my journey so I have
opened uh
a microscopic Academy too after my
journey and I have done lots lots and I
have so huge plans in the next five to
ten years
I will be extraordinary I'll make sure
my students will be extraordinary I want
to do something for the Dentistry
because I'm a dentist I want to do
something for the Dentistry so this is
what I have decided so I have never left
hopes I am not bored of what I'm doing I
will always give a try
2012 2013 I am like you in a college
like you maybe few of you are from my ug
College few of you are from my PC
college and few of you are in a far
better colleges than where I have been
where I was being okay so this is what
my journey and what I learned from my
journey is
you can take suggestions from the people
around you but you don't have 100
percentage right to implement them in
your life until you decide that what you
want in your life
so finally welcome to the team conquer
okay so so I'm the I'm the lead of
conquer if you want to travel or if you
want to go ahead in the next upcoming
few years I'll be the I'll do my best to
help you out in whatever way I can so
all of you has this confusion what after
BDS okay does your past have an effect
no I I will tell that past doesn't have
any effect because past I was I was so
bad I was so bad tweeted my preparation
in the middle quitted the clinic in the
middle quitted the plan to us in the
middle because when I Was preparing
there was so many people was prepared
and they were done with their masters
and I was there in the clinic so many
people were there in the clinic they are
doing good and I was planning to say
along with me there were so many people
who has planned for us City ever in USA
and few of them are already done with
GDs so everywhere the people who has
shared the journey
are successful very few people were out
of scope but most of them are successful
so what I can tell you is
pass doesn't have an impact it may
influence but doesn't have an impact so
remove your past work in the present and
plan for your future and what I strongly
recommend you is a goal without a plan
is just a base like for example like few
of you may may plan for a weekend trip
or a weekend
your goal is to go for a trip but you
should have a plan to reach your trip so
planning is very very important so I
strongly believe that most of us doesn't
have a planning itself you know someone
has to plan for you
your life someone has to write okay go
like this do like this marry this girl
or give birth to two kids join them in
these two colors everyone has to come
and tell me at every level everyone
someone has to come and tell us that to
do this to do that do this do that
parents will come you have to be in this
place only you have to be in this
college only do this department only
this call is only good
someone has to write your story or you
will write your story you decide so keep
a goal
sir I don't know this I don't have money
I also don't have money I'm very
horrible situation I was not in a
position to pay my MDS first year fees
also at that time probably like seven
years back I was so horrible financially
so don't come and tell us do this do
that do this do that financially low I
cannot open a clinic so I'm planning
like this no don't underestimate
yourself first see what you're good at
start working on those areas what are
the options left over start working on
those areas be serious in your life life
is only once once it is done it's done
so be serious in your life be serious in
your profession
okay so I want every one of you to
become a uh
good dentist not dentists all of your
dentists I want to become a good dentist
great dentist good dentist great
Dentistry is different from a normal
dentist so so many of us ask sir
Dentistry is saturated yes Dentistry is
saturated but not good Dentistry how
many of you accept this statement
Dentistry is saturated yes hundred
percent is saturated
good Dentistry is not saturated ER good
Dentistry is not saturated good industry
is always open
can you tell me how many of your college
teachers or your college pgs can do a
proper Perfect Smile Design
good industry is not saturated I want
good dentists I want good teachers I
want I'll give you a job come if you're
a good dentist we are there
your skillful dentist you are there
doctors are there we need good dentists
we need great doctors we need good
doctors
yes that's what I'm telling every one of
your target to become that it's not
mandatory that you can be but you have
to give a try you should not keep some
limitations some box limitations for
your growth
you for example you take a fruit Keep It
In A Box the fruit cannot go grow beyond
that box so first leave the limitations
leave that the Discrimination part okay
I am from Village I cannot do anything
my parents will not allow me to do
anything I should get married my husband
will not do anything my husband husband
may not help me to do anything other
people around me will not help me don't
know why you are asking someone to help
you you do something keep on doing keep
on doing keep on doing keep on working
son one day you will be stuck
so for that what should I do next
question sir okay you lots of things you
have experienced but in this 10 years
process okay what should I do
first principle of life to be successful
is trust you should have 100 distrust on
yourself and Trust depends upon these
things one is consistency constantly
hitting the same area keep on working
working working and make sure if you
keep on working under the time means in
the Lesser time okay so if for example
like sir I want to crack an entrance
so next question for me is how many
years in how many years you want to
crack an entrance most of you will
answer it sir within the next exam so it
means you should get that consistency
and hard work in very less time so trust
is inversely proportional to time the
less the time you are mastering
something
the more the trust you are going to
build
do you accept this the less the time you
are mastering something you are learning
something you are practicing something
you are achieving something the more the
trust you are going to build on yourself
the more the consistency
sir whatever it is let my marginal Rich
break down let my root canal fail I keep
on doing and practicing practicing and
I'll practice the extractions one day
after doing 100 extractions you will get
the trust yes I can do this I can make
it
okay right so this is how uh what you
have to focus on right so trust
consistency and time are the important
things that you have to focus in the
next few years to be best in your
profession
so I hope you know this you know this
guys you know like I hope you are
familiar with the cricket cricket is one
of the craziest thing okay so hope you
know this like so this is a this is the
recent one day World Cup okay long back
happened this marginal error
has end the career of
the best player of the country
the best player of the country whatever
it is the best captain of the country is
dhoni okay it has ended the career of an
individual
he's just shot
I don't know whether they're going to
take the World Cup even if he crosses
that but people will consider he's just
short and same thing happened in the
same World Cup in the final
the New Zealand
has not registered the World Cup till
the date because they were short
the final the final match was a tie and
followed by the sober over is also a
time and finally England has been the
World Cup so this is the best example
what I can kill there are few cases like
situations where we'll be short
okay the best example what I can give
you is most of you are shot by few marks
so that is the reason why you are in
various or else you would be in MDS
sorry mbbs
okay so the first thing is first
differentiate whether you want to stay
in India or whether you want to stay
abroad so the next one is
how much amount you are going to spend
if it's abroad how much amount you are
going to spend
and how much time it's going to take so
these are the two parameters that you
have to consider for every step in USA
and of course the person who is able to
balance this time and money is who
who is going to balance this time and
money
in India particularly in India
who is going to balance this time and
money for you
come on I want you to answer this
yes so this balancer is your parents
okay so before you take any call okay so
particularly a broad calls you have to
sit with the parents and explain the
consequences and explain the financial
limitations and explain the time
limitations then only you have to take
an abroad call this is my personal
suggestion for each and every one of you
next one is
before you're taking any any sort of
option of abroad think about the
negative side of the options so negative
side of the options you have to decide
means what are the disadvantages of
taking this option but once you lock to
an option once you are fixed to an
option you always think about the
positive side
clear is it clear best example I can
give you if you are planning to get
married to a particular individual
think about the negatives bad qualities
in the individual but once you are
married now think only about the
positive side so this is something like
that you decide the goal but every goal
has some negative side okay think about
the negative side before you take the
call but once you are fixed think about
only the Positive Vibes and positive
side of the particular chord that could
be USA Let It Be India or let it be
anything
next how can you do MDS I'll try to be
I'll try to be a bit fast how can you do
MDS in India you have two options to do
MDS
one is meet MDS examination
in which 98 percentage of seats in the
country will be filled second one is ini
CET
MDS exam in which two percentage of the
seats in the country will be filled so
imict has only association with aims
PGA and chipmunk and in PG and chipmunk
you have very less number of seats
throttled together 10 per year
aims is going to turn somewhere around
like 20 25 to 35 per year
and rest other seats your college my
college GDC all colleges will come
underneath so these are the two exams
which you have to clear to enter into
MDS
I hope this is clear so neat and ironic
are the two exams which you have to
write to get into MDS next one how many
GDC states are there
per year in India anyone can answer how
many GDC seats government Dental College
sits I'm not talking about all seats I'm
talking about government Dental College
it's government Dental policies means
colleges which are associated with
metropolitan cities and colleges which
has free seats these are free MDS seats
okay these are free MDS seats
okay so how many seats are there in
India around
500 to 550
Plus
plus jdc seats
are there
500 and to 550 government Dental College
seats are there in India
now how many seats are there per year in
your particular state in your particular
state
okay so I'm going to list out few
important states where most of your
students are from rest others if you
want you can ping me on the on my number
on the WhatsApp I'll send you the
details of your state
so for example I hope most of Andhra
students are there so these are the
number of government Dental College
seats in your particular state so you
have Vijayawada jdc it's having three
period Department three neural surgery
three in indoor so total nine seats are
there in Vijayawada
and three oral surgery and three perio
you have more seats in GDC katapa so
these are the number of seats available
in state of Andhra so jumping into state
of uh MP I think MP students were not
there a few of them okay so MP you have
these following seats you have JD Cinder
which was started very recently for MDS
they have started recently they have
increased the seats also so these are
the number of seeds one two three four
five six seven twenty one plus eight 29
seats are there in GDC
and coming to Telangana you have only
one government college that is GDC
Hyderabad so GDC Hyderabad you have one
two three four five six seven eight nine
so you have 27 seats in GDC Hyderabad
and followed by Karnataka people GDC
Bangalore is there so one two three four
five six seven eight nine you have 27
seats in GDC Bangalore coming to
Maharashtra GDC Mumbai you have many
gdc's highest number of government
Dental College seats in the entire
country are there in Maharashtra so you
see GDC Mumbai you have 20 30 40 you
have 50 seats in only one college Mumbai
is Mumbai GDC Mumbai is having 50 seats
similarly GDC Aurangabad is there one
two three four five six seven eight you
have 24 seats
and coming to GDC nagpur again from
Maharashtra one two three four five six
seven twenty one and twenty three seats
are there in nagpur and GDC Nair Mumbai
you have one two three four five
you have 63 seats in GDC Nile
okay so Maharashtra is having the
highest number of seats I hope you I'll
post these details on your respective
groups these are the number of gdc's
where most of your students were focused
on so I mean like for example if you're
planning your preparation for next year
and your internship is already started
and if you finish your internship by
December 31st 2023 you're eligible for
this examination that is your inis 80
November 2023 your first examination is
going to be so this examination is going
to include 15 seats and the examination
is for 200 marks and it is for three
hours exam is for three hours all your
exams in ICT need both are three hours
only and negative marking is minus one
third means for every right answer
you'll get plus one Mark and for every
wrong answer you'll get minus one third
and you have to solve each question in
50 seconds and you'll have diagram based
questions also here they're going to
give an x-ray clinical photograph and
they'll ask you the diagnosis or they
can give you the instrument similar like
your spotters in your oral pathology
oral medicine surgery perio all these
departments they keep some supporters
those are nothing but called as diagram
based questions so regular questions
will be 160 the different pattern of
questions will be in and around like 50
to 20. so the different pattern of
questions are basically
your assertion and reason based
questions match the following true or
false
and multi multi-option questions okay so
arrange the following in ascending water
descending order such questions are
there the newly added questions so this
is your inict 2000 November 2023
eligibility criteria as of now it may
slightly modify is you need to finish
your internship by December 31st 2023
then you are eligible for this
particular examination which is going to
be in November 2023 before you complete
your internship only the exam will be
there the result will be out and the
college is going to start from January
2024 January 2-0 so if you complete your
internship immediately without any
without any break like probably by
taking a one month break you are going
to join the college immediately
the next exam that you are eligible for
is
neat dates may vary slightly okay it may
be in Jan or sometimes it may be they
may postpone to March similar like this
year so it will be March or January 2024
the eligibility criteria mostly will be
March 31st so the eligibility criteria
is March 31st 2024 by March 31st 2024
you have to finish your internship for
eligible for this examination what seats
are included in this all GDC seats
private college seats Army Dental Corps
even Army Dental Corps selection all
deemed callers everything except aims
PGA will be filled through this the
number of questions will be 240 in ICT
200 only this is 240. time duration is
same three hours there three hours here
here negative marking is minus one for
ini it is minus one that means every
right answer you will get plus four
marks and every wrong answer you'll get
minus one so here you have to solve each
question in 50 seconds diagram based
questions will be somewhere around 35 to
40 you have lengthy clinical case based
questions also
so this is the this is a rough outline
of both the examinations okay I'll post
this recorded version if you want you
can watch it again or I will post this
uh Blueprints and everything in your
respect to Whatsapp group so that you
can check whenever you want
and if you want to give one more round
because in ICT will be done twice in a
year inict
it is two times in here neat is only one
time in here okay so immediately in the
May session you will have one more one
more round of inicity the contents will
be almost same normally November in a
city you will have only aims
so this is uh the blueprint that is
given by nbe people
national board exam people has given a
blueprint for neat MDS preparation so
this is a blueprint and most of the
subjects are going to carry 14 months 14
14 14 14 14. so here they have splitted
physiology and biochemistry together 14.
General path microbiology together 14.
oral medicine and Radiology together 14
cons and Endo together for them so all
subjects are going to carry 14 marks and
totally it's going to be 240 score
and what books you need to follow okay
so of course like if you're a part of
MDS conquer we are going to give you the
power playbooks okay and I strongly
recommend either to pick dentist 7th or
eighth clinical volumes or you can buy
the dental pulse okay whatever any of
these books and few students they read
both the books nothing wrong in Reading
both the books but you should
differentiate the common content in both
the books and you have to exclude that
during the revision part that I am going
to help you and you have to do all the
question papers from 2017 to 2022 that
are available on the website now this
year we are planning to increase this
from 2010 to 2022.
all hold question papers will be there
whenever you want you can solve you have
a question bank that is being added to
the website which is totally different
from last year and all latest Concepts
you have in videos and you would have
Smart notes on the website you will have
last minute revision on the website
you'll have mock exams you have textbook
reading so everything so what not
everything are included in this
particular pattern and this is I
strongly recommend whether it is inict
ornate I strongly recommend this is the
best checklist you have because you have
to keep a limited preparation uh
material so that you can revise this n
number of times revision is required
from all the directions revenues
required in a number of times
next so this is all about MDS so the
second best option if you want to stay
in India apart from uh like apart from
the academics Clinic opening a clinic
working in a clinic XYZ all this stuff
the common stuffs are there I'm I'm I'm
trying to be more going with a more
professional subs and of course few
people are asking so there's something
called as Army
Dental groups okay so the initial pay
for Army rental cops uh touches around
95 to uh
every year they are going to pick some
30 to 35
vacancies will be there sometimes more
but mostly it is 30 to 35 vacancies for
this you have to clear round one the
round one is neat examination
so you have to get a very good rank in
the neat examination followed by which
you are going to apply with your neat
examination and they are going to keep a
cut off and the second round is going to
be an interview
interview followed by medical
examination
so finally after finishing these two
they are going to release a final Merit
list
the final Merit list if you are standing
in the top 40 there are high chances
that you can enter into Army
clear so this is about Army Corps First
you need to enter internet but twist
two thousand
2021 before Army Dental Corps is
different
2020 to I'm not I don't know about 2023
but 2022 what they have done is they
have kept a quarter differently for a
male and a female
previously we don't have a quarter of
male and female okay recently this is
launched in 2020 to last year only so
they have kept only three openings for
female
female three openings more openings for
males
okay more openings for males so the
cutoff will be different for female and
the cutoff will be different for male
last year the cutoff for female was
around 250 all India ranks whereas
cutoff for male is around 2000 all India
right okay so the cutoff has very this
is the first time that has happened
whether whether they are going to stick
on to the same rule for the next year
that is 2023 or whether they are going
to modify the rule I don't know we don't
know as of now we don't know we don't
have any proper information on that we
need to wait for that but before 2021
common cutoff for both male and female
okay I hope this is very clear Step One
is need
good rank than if you are in the First
Merit list then
then you can then you can go for an
interview followed by the medical exam
the salary turns to be around one lakh
and you will have all the opportunities
like this is a Gazette post you'll have
all the allowances like army people are
going to have
the next one is I'm going to talk a
little bit of five minutes about inbd so
inbd is an international board
examination which is done for your TDS
DDS so steps in inbd
the first and foremost important thing
is uh first you need to send your
documents for easy evaluation you have
to send the documents for USA and
followed by after EC evaluation you can
generate a dental pin
you can generate a dental PIN followed
by the generation of dental pin okay you
will get a pin you will get a number
with which you can book the slot for the
exam inbd
so previously we used to have nbda part
one and part two followed by NBD part
one after you pass part one you have to
give part two but now it is being
shifted okay it is being shifted we have
only one exam called as integrated
national birds exam so you have to clear
this examination once the exam is
cleared you have to build your profile
profile is something like a simple word
CV or a biodata with which with all the
recommendation letters and everything
you have to apply for every University
so if they like your profile they are
going to call you for an interview
followed by
bench test
if you qualify this interview followed
by Banks test
then you will be given the TDS
okay and DDS is it varies from
University's University so somewhere
around like it is two years four months
course
and you'll have a waiting period of six
months after getting an admission and
the waiting period here varies for for a
uses it will be more for post graduates
the waiting period will be less uses uh
it may take two to three years waiting
period here for a pgs it ranges from one
to one and a half year
but a few few of my seniors have cracked
in one year less than one year also okay
so this is a rough plan so what is that
first you have to send your documents
Dental pill generation then IMBD
examination then profile built up then
you have to apply for the universities
then they are going to call you for
interviews and pains test then you have
to finish your TDS then you have to come
and do the job a bit expensive and time
taking the only issues are expensive
because DDS course itself is going to
cost 1.8 to 2.2 crores of Indian
currency okay so it's going to be
expensive and it's going to take away
time if you are if you if you can
overcome those two barriers this is not
this is a very good option
okay so that's all about DDS so Dental
pin
inbd inbd preparation you can start in
India itself okay so bench test uh you
have to go to USA and write this invd
followed by the next steps also you have
to go to us every step has to be done in
the USA so next one there were a few
people asking me about Canada or say
Canada uh like Canada I think like if
you are planning to go for Masters the
story is going to be different but I'm
talking about more often related to the
industry I'm nowhere interested to talk
about dental hygienist okay dental
hygienist is different dentist is
different okay so dental hygienist is
you are going for a low profile thing
but uh like so in Canada if you want to
go if you if you have one option two
options in Canada one is you can go for
DDS in Canada Canada also DDS is
providing DDS DDS is also provided in
Canada also along with USA But number of
seats and chances will be very very less
so that is the reason why if you want to
do it if you want to do DDS definitely
uh USA is going to be the best option
the next one is uh like Canada is going
to have an
equivalency examinations
equivalency processes so you will have
an equivalency examinations where you
have to clear a series of examinations
and to start this processing you need to
spend somewhere around 1000 to 1100
Canada dollars
dollars okay followed by the first part
in this is
you need to finish first exam is AFK the
AFK is something called as assessment of
fundamental knowledge assessment of
fundamental knowledge is the first step
and the processing fees is around 800 to
900 dollars
and this occurs two times in a year
if you fail once you have to wait for
six months to give the exam again
so once you're done with the exam you
have to go for the second examination
that is a c j acj is nothing but a
system of clinical judgment
and the processing fees for this is 13
100 to 1400 US dollar Canada dollars and
this also occur two times in a year
then once you're done with the second
exam then you need to move the third
exam that is ACS exam that is called as
assessment of
clinical skills this is a practical exam
assessment of clinical skills and you
need to spend somewhere around 900 9000
to 10 000 dollars for this
so once you are done with this then you
have to go for the level Next Level what
is that next level you have to go for
ndeb
certification
and the processing fees for this is 450
dollars
here you have two parts part one is a
written exam which is going to be
thousand dollars and part two is osce
osc is nothing but called as object to
structured clinical examination
objective structured clinical
examination so this is again thousand
dollars after clearing this you will
have license to work in Canada so this
is Canada is a multi-step you need to
clear multiple steps multiple steps and
lots of examinations has to be cleared
to get license in Canada so it is going
to take time apart from money it's going
to take take some time and it's going to
require so much of hard work this is the
outline to get license in Canada
next one there are a few people asking
about UK
UK there are two modes of uh pushing the
people okay the one mod is ore
Ora examination that is overseas
registration examination second one is
uh LTS there are few people nowadays
writing this LDS LDS is license dental
surgery examination license dental
surgery examination so one part is this
one part is true this is tough exam
pattern this is tough and this is a bit
easy comparatively easy okay and all
these examinations will be done in UK in
London only okay so here you will have
two parts one is a written exam
and second one is a practical exam in
this written exam also it will be done
in part A Part B or it will be done in
one day first day and second day so
first day you'll be having basic
sciences and second day you'll be having
clinical sense it's more of application
based and this examination Ora
examination will be done two times
and year
two times an year and the most difficult
part of this over examination is booking
a slot slots are not available okay the
slots will be opened and the slots will
be closed within 10 to 15 seconds so you
should be ready they are going to tell
you at what time they are going to
release the slots and what day they are
going to release the slots so
immediately at the time you have to be
ready uh to book the slot if the slot is
lost you have to wait for six months for
the next round to get your slot booked
okay
so these are the two examinations
and this is done by The Authority that
is going to done this lds's Royal
College of Surgeons in London they are
going to conduct this this examination
so any of these examinations if you
clear you can practice in USA sorry in
UK there were like two of my seniors
when was when I was there in ug uh as of
now they are practicing and one of them
has reason to open a clinic also and in
my PC one of my immediate Junior right
now done with LDS right now done with
LDS and she was just waiting to clear
this or and recently she was not able to
book the slot she was more worried about
she lost the slot so she's waiting for
the next six months to clear the ore and
she's from Uganda if time permits I'll
definitely uh make a live session with
these people like uh people who has
recently entered into DDS or done with
the radius or people who are written
this ore and everything I have a I have
a decent number of my close friends and
seniors and juniors who have done this
then I'll be talking about UAE so UAE
can be any other countries like Saudi
women uh Qatar your Dubai and all these
things so nowadays what has happened is
they're trying to replace the BDS task
by MDA staff now the rules are a bit
strict until unless you have someone who
is doing MDS who is who has an MDS tag
and for example if wife and husband why
husband is MDS or wife is MDS and
husband is BDS then you can think of
going to UA but openly now they are not
allowing the PDS people to work in UAE
okay so because I have in the last batch
I have many many of my students uh who
used to prepare from there to clear the
MDS and recently in Karnataka there were
like two or three people who has joined
okay they were like the race is almost
like 45 years they're Elder to me okay
they work 15 or 15 to 18 years over
there in UAE and Saudi and all these
things and recently they came back to
finish their MDS and again they want to
go back because nowadays they're
replacing the PDF stuff with mdst up
because
both are getting at the same cost okay
but that's what I'm telling whatever
you're going to earn in UAE is going to
be two to three times more than what you
are going to earn in India like for
example if an endodontist is making one
lakh per month in UAE uh they're going
to make uh three lakhs that three times
Revenue one of my immediate senior uh
now she's making 4.5 to 5 lakhs per
month in in Saudi okay I'll definitely
May I'll definitely try 100 test she's
very interested to interact with you
probably within within a month I'll
definitely plan a live session Instagram
with her so you can interact with her
directly she's doing extraordinary she
is doing very very good
that is what UAE requires MDS and not
immediate MDS they require two to three
years experience after MDS means after
finishing MDS you need to have a two to
three years clinical practice then if
you have any plans to make more money
because most of uh of of the people who
shifted to UAE their target is to make
more money earn more money because of
the financial limitations and of course
the quality of treatment is definitely
good compared to here similar options
are there in Malaysia too you may not go
for a clinical practice in Malaysia but
you can work as an academician in
Malaysia and the salaries are again like
1.5 to 2 times more double the the
earnings in India there there is two of
my batchmates three of my batchmates who
are working in Malaysia University and
of course we have a staff the period
perio staff the period staff from MDS
conquer uh he used to work here now
recently he has shifted to Malaysia
we'll definitely keep an interaction
with him that is very feasible for us in
the next few days we can plan an
interaction with him no problem
okay so whatever may be the step and
whatever may be the things uh the
preparation is always the same okay the
preparation is always the same so how do
you start anything new how do you start
anything new
guys
hope hope you have done this cycling and
all these things you will start
practicing so in the initial phases of
your practice so there will be lots of
difficulties that you have to accept
those difficulties
you have to accept those difficulties so
starting is always difficult okay so
thing is you need to find the key things
when you're starting the preparation or
when you're starting anything you need
to talk with the mentors DH that is
going to that is going to take lots of
time this is not the session to talk
about UAE examinations because every uh
I mean like every every territory is
going to have a different examination
okay the different board for a user it's
a different Examination for a specialty
it's a different examination that's
going to take a long session if you have
any such things we will talk about that
uh when when we have time about that so
in just a second
okay so right so anything it's going to
take time so like how I explained my
story so in the initial phases I faced
lots of difficulties uh I don't know
whether I'm doing right or not once I
have started few things uh I felt it is
wrong I failed I came back because at
that time only I used to have my friends
in Dubai I still have my friends in
different different countries so I I
checked out all the opportunities uh
from for all the countries before I take
a particular call so few things I
skipped because I'm not fit for this few
things
I have taken a call but there doesn't
suit me I failed so it's all about like
in the initial phases you have to choose
the options well or you need to sit with
someone who has a better knowledge over
this and you need to talk them and you
need to take their help okay and you
need to start the proceedings okay so
learning is difficult always but once
you master the learning the things will
be easy and the things will be very very
simple so that's what I want to conclude
so starting problem will be there but if
you keep works hard like you have that
rule of 21 principle every new uh Habit
or every new thing whatever you're
starting it requires some practice for
21 days so there are a few people who
start the preparation without finishing
those 21 days first five days only they
will decide sir I will not get a seat I
cannot read I cannot do I cannot survive
a dentist so don't come to conclusions
just by reading five or ten days or just
by reading one or two months you need to
talk with the right person sit and talk
with the right person everyone cannot be
a Topper Topper means always one
all India one means only one person
State first only one person will be
there so every every time you can you
cannot be that one you may be that one
but you cannot be that one it doesn't
means you are not going to end all the
all all if it is the only oriented offer
and state topper can survey only few
people will be there in dentistry okay
so the point here is you have to focus
on your abilities you have to start
working on them and we'll see what are
the possibilities let's talk with the
mentors interact with the mentors
frequently then you can find the
solution and second one is the most
important is time management how you
manage your time so many of the intents
they come and tell me sir I'm doing this
I'm doing that I'm not able to have time
I'm so strained and no I I used to
manage MDS conquer when I was there in
first year MDS first year MDS second
year MD is 39. I feel like MDS PG people
are will be more busy than ug people so
it's all about the illusion you have
that illusion that I cannot do
remove that illusion come out talk with
the people who can give that positive
vibes to you and you can definitely
fetch those things and make the things
on track and we are we are there to help
you the only thing is what I can assure
you is we are always there to help you
at any time at any position
Okay so
coming to the courses which are more
effective with high percentage so MDS
conquer for MDS we are going to provide
these courses already browsers and
everything are given to you again I will
be sharing this we have plan a and plan
Pro okay so the difference between plan
and plan Pro is the live Zoom classes as
of now we are having one class per week
but probably once your seniors are done
with you their March 1st examination
will be having two classes we'll be
having two classes that is the only
difference and you will have access to
the recorded version of this live class
also in prolab okay and and everything
is common for both the plans okay the
only difference is pro-live is going to
have extra live classes and of course
the state Toppers and all India Toppers
most of them are pro-life students
because uh if you take Plan A Plan A is
going to be monotonous means it will be
only one-way preparation uh if if you
take a prologue you'll have that
interactive sessions very frequently
with the mentors so you can maintain
that active mode of preparation plan
yeah I strongly recommend for
like I got a message I'm a mother of uh
two kids so mother of two kids they may
not allow you to sit for a longer
duration in a live class and they will
not allow you to hear so I suggest for a
Mothers or for the people who are
preparing from UAE or people who has
their own clinics or people who are
working in the clinics because they
cannot come and attend the sessions of
live which will be from six to eight
o'clock in the evening six to eight
o'clock exactly how to come or else you
had to again hear the live Live recorded
sessions okay so such people who are at
different timeline I suggest them to go
for uh plan a or our financial
limitations or anything XYZ because a
few students they may be part of other
coaching Center also they may have a
different schedule so I I recommend them
to go for planning the regular practice
and everything that is useful videos are
there and everything you can watch them
but if you want to be more focused or
more dedicated or more streamlined to
the team I recommend plan Pro because
you'll have that interaction with the
mentors you can talk with the mentors of
course plan your people can also talk
with the mentors we don't have that
barrier but thing is you see a mentor
like this this is a live Zoom class
something like a live Zoom class you
will have a similar classes like like
this every week one or two classes will
be there in the Pro live which are not
there in the planning that is the only
difference rest everything will be same
uh
okay and of course offline Hyderabad
offline Hyderabad Center is there where
you can have your live sessions we will
have that online access along with
online access you will have that offline
facility also okay you'll have study
room access AC study room access 24 into
seven Library access will be there and
the advantage of the Hyderabad offline
is you will have a mentor every time
you'll have a mentor you're going to
have a mentor every day okay one or
other Mentor will be there in a
particular duration of time to interact
with you to clear your doubts or XYZ
stuff so these are the three plans that
MDS concrete is going to provide plan a
plan Pro and offline I hope like if you
are far away from Hyderabad then the
only option is either to go for plan a
or plan Pro
so these are the Hyderabad offline
Center photographs
so I'll share all these things all these
things are there in the browser
or offline centers so apart from that I
told you right we are conducting a
national I mean International
examinations also so we have bench test
program program course also
International exam or clinical
orientation program with the lasers
microscopes all Modern Dentistry water
endo and everything we have courses
about that
we have a 14 days bench discourse as
well as 14 days clinical orientation
course to improve your clinical skills
uh everything what not
okay so this is the lab we have
so this is a MDS conquer previous result
so we are striking the best ranks single
digit ranks every year last year we got
eighth rank to Telangana Intel before
that we got uh we got category State all
India first Rank and before that we got
all India's second rank for Andhra
intern and before that we got all India
fourth rank uh for Gemini and Kashmir
student and we got third rank in 2018
for an Andhra intern
and uh the last year result uh we bought
major Pradesh State first okay sadhana
has got 20 second Rank and we got Assam
State second apart from Andhra Telangana
State first from past six years okay and
I hope like most of these maybe your
seniors or you may know these faces okay
so for other uh courses I I was talking
more specific about MDS and inict but
other abroad courses uh you can contact
me this is my phone number you can say
this number double nine eight nine four
two seven nine seven one
so this is an information from my side
as exactly I have taken one hour to
finish this so I want to
extend my session to the other speakers
uh I need I need I need some time
just a second
yeah hi
just a second and
I'm making as an admin
s map now your host
foreign
is my voice clear I hope it's clear
so this is
I'll just give me one moment I'll share
the screen
guys meanwhile you can drop your doubts
on the chat box if you have any doubts
okay any doubts question answer session
you can drop on the chat box we'll try
to answer once the session is done
foreign
so hi students I hope
everyone is here
so you can leave a message if the screen
is not clear I hope it's clear
is it clear everyone
is the screen clear great
so yes good evening everyone welcome
everyone so
all our people who have attended today's
session are doctors right so I would
like to start by saying one thing that
you're not just a doctor every one of
you who is having the prefix of being
called as a doctor is having a
superpower okay so which makes our
profession to be very much Noble enough
when compared to any other thing of
course every profession is equally good
nowadays but yes the doctors who are the
who have been the French Warriors even
in a covet right even the dentist have
got the very good chance to serve the
society during a covet right so we are
always having that superpower to treat
the pain
so pain is one thing which the patient
actually suffers a lot when compared to
anything okay so the pain could be
anything either it could be
psychological or mental or physical so
we are treating the pain which is
related to the tooth or the oral
cavities so we should be glad for doing
that
okay so one more thing I would always
always keep on saying I've heard from
one of my professors who said that you
should be very much glad to be called as
a dentist or a doctor who's having an
MDS followed by that why because we are
treating the tooth pain
okay so tooth pain is the third most
severe pain in the world the first pain
being the labor pain the second pain
being the pain which is related to
myocardial infarction and the third most
severe pain is a tooth pain so we all
are lucky enough that we are treating
that okay or we are about to treat the
oral cavity related issues okay so
myself Dr saithi I'm into the team of
MDS conquer from the past six and a half
years six plus years
and I've done my masters in oral
medicine so I've done my BDS and um
from usmania from GDC Highway and MBS
from Vishnu dental college and I'm into
the team of MDS conquer and I'm handling
the MBS as Prince from the past six and
a half years
so yes so so welcome you all so what I
would like to start is so the world
today
is like now if you call me uh what is
the world today so it is like before
covet and after covet do you say yes or
no so the world is changed like that it
is before and after covet so everyone's
life is like that what was your life
before covert and after covet so even I
would like to explain our theme of what
all I have been through with my students
or with our students with the team in
this past six and a half years so it's
like before and after covet so initially
from uh in the beginning of the team
when I was with the team in the
beginning years so we were into this as
you can see on the screen so we were
having a very good official website so
which was handling many of the exams
we've also had daily WhatsApp
discussions
okay we used to have personal
interaction and mentoring we used to
have offline classes we used to clarify
each and every doubt that was posted by
the students and always it was
integrated approach of both the medical
as well as the dental subjects so this
was the initial three four years before
covet which we used to do okay starting
it was online and later we have opened
the offline Center and in the offline
Center we used to handle offline classes
but what happened later as we know the
covet has entered so because of which uh
the students couldn't get the chance to
come to the offline Center because of
the situations that has demanded by the
government or by the students themselves
so this colleges was closed the students
had to stay at home uh the they were
they never used to have their books or
because all the books were in the
hostels they suddenly got locked
themselves the lockdown was too terrific
I know everyone has went through that
phase is I need not explain how the
phase was those days so we had come
through Innovative approach towards
reaching every student in the remote
areas of the country as well that is via
Smart notes and smart videos so even
those who didn't have a textbooks with
them who don't have a library we could
do this via our Smart Video so that was
the advancement so year by year we had
uh like Incorporated many new things so
that it did make much difference when
compared to the previous years so during
covet with us those two years of course
there was daily WhatsApp discussions
there was mentoring and interaction the
website exams were there having topic
specific subject specific the Grand and
the mock exams besides that we have made
a website so like a phenomenal that it
had very good videos so we had covered
some important videos around 500 plus
videos along with smart notes for those
two years or maybe one and a half year
like that and online classes we used to
conduct via Zoom so Zoom was a very good
app from which came into action during
the covert as we know that so via online
uh that platform we did take many online
sessions so that was the time then and
once the covet was fine and uh we
handled and everything again went back
the vaccination was there and all the
students were good enough and they
started coming to colleges and
everything was again back to form then
even we were back to form and we made
every topic specific video so every
topic which is there in your pals or in
your textbook we have a video on that so
on that around 1500 plus videos so that
is the latest update in this past one
and a half year that we have done so we
have some 1500 plus videos and the
videos are also in the latest format
like you will be seeing the man talk
sitting and explaining so you can see
the mentor you can can see the
explanation you can see the Expressions
you can see everything that's life so it
is not something like bore or something
you will have that feel that we're
directly seeing the mentor so that sort
of a new technology uh was incorporated
by our technical team which really
helped us to do so so our technology
technical team is very efficient and
they have helped us to really do that so
we did that in front of the camera and
we really have improved a lot
technically as well so even the students
really like that and even uh they got a
very good knowledge seeing those videos
now from 500 it's 1500 plus videos we
have in our website and that too many
most of the videos are in the new format
and anyways we have the smart notes and
since the offline classes again got
started because the covet has uh like no
it's like not much now so we have many
offline students offline classes are
there every week it times we have two or
three offline classes and again online
classes for the pro batch students has
sir explained it is via Zoom and uh
one-to-one interaction but with offline
students with the online batch everyone
we have through the zoom as well as
through our phone or contact however
they try to contact we do that and
now latest in this one one and a half
year we have our apps as well so every
phone whoever is the student of MDS
conquer they can install this MTS
conquer app okay so that is the latest
advance and this from the past I think
six to eight months we have been taking
a lot of live sessions Instagram so if
you open our Instagram page you can see
many live sessions picture based
discussions daily spikes means hardly 30
seconds or one minute nearly 30 seconds
spikes will be there where you will be
given all the memory based or picture
based content which you will like which
will regenerate your memory based things
so like that we have planning
innovatively day by day the team is
working very hard for that so this is
upgradation that we have done it's from
the past six and a half years that I am
into it of course it is the ninth badge
that is going on so sir has handled the
first two years later I joined him and I
am into the team so from my journey with
the team what I've seen the improvement
from our site is all this and especially
we have seen the same reciprocation from
the students as well because the
students really felt that all that we
have done is really helpful for them and
they have given a very good
reciprocation and feedback and we do
take suggestions from them and we are
improving day by day so that is the
thing that we have done
and most of the questions that is put
forward by any of you could be what
could be the difference
of this team with the others like with
their many institutes across the country
but what could be the major difference
ma'am or sir you would have asked us so
what is the difference that I can say is
the very first difference is our website
there we have a incredible website okay
so it's absolutely very student friendly
so it is so easy to use okay and it's
very good to use so you must be having a
doubt already in many of the institutes
or app is also there ma'am then what is
the use of the website
okay so most of the students like 80 to
90 percent of the students do have an
app in their phone okay but given an
exam in a phone
is make versus giving an exam in a
laptop or in a computer makes much
difference because you need to have that
experience before sitting in front of
the laptop or the like touching the
mouse and removing or moving the cursor
so that experience is different when
compared to just giving in a phone so
that makes a major difference honestly
speaking because
um using a computer and using a what do
you say the mouse is actually much much
better and that exactly the exam
platform how the exam will be how the
time will be the time lapse how every
question you will be going further and
how the exam will end on time
irrespectives you want to give beyond
the time also you can't give everything
is in our website
okay so you will be getting that
complete experience
through our website giving exams on
website these videos are smart notes you
can use the app anywhere anytime
anywhere but exam approach it's always
via laptop or if uh like you have the
computers or an internet content in your
colleges or you can have your laptop
because laptop is much in your post
graduation and in the worst situation
you can also use your tab but this exam
that proforma is completely like your
final exam so it's like that and one to
one interaction with the mentor is there
which is I can actually say that no
other Institute can give it so any
student who approaches us at any point
of time we have that one-to-one
interaction with the mentor okay so we
have the preach and approach towards
anywhere any any student across the
country so that makes the major
difference and the what next are we
planning is we are going to have more
video access uh like the videos will be
connected to the smart nodes and to the
topic specific exam which will be easy
for you and on important topics we'll be
handling like two or three mentors can
take a discussion that sort of new
format also we are planning and also we
are planning for the question Bank okay
so this is the latest thing that I
wanted to tell
so yes so these are the things that I
wanted to tell the students so I will be
glad if you be the part of your our team
because you will be really beneficial so
many of the students have given us that
feedback so I will really happy and glad
if you are a part of our team so yes Dr
srikan
yeah thank you thank you so much ma'am
for all the updates and the history of
MDS conquer so now now I want to uh move
to the next part that is uh sorry is
waiting gauri Shankar sir is waiting so
he's going to talk about a few positive
words what I really require because star
is basically a hod uh when I was there
in third BDS I told my story right SAR
also has a major part in my story he was
my teacher when I was there in third BDS
and now he's I'm very glad that he's
going he's he's a part of conquer and of
course lots of wisdom lots of knowledge
experience grows the knowledge comes so
my knowledge my wisdom is nothing before
him so he is here to give some more
motivation for me my team and as well as
for you sir the session is hand over to
user
thank you thank you srikanth am I
Audible
yes sir yes sir
yeah thank you srikanth for your nice
words of introduction
and
can you please uh enable me for shared
screening ma'am um
okay
and happy New Year to all of you I am
happy that all of us gathered here to
discuss about the MDS PG internal
preparation I'm very happy that this
year
I am joining this
MDS conqueror group I have seen three
cons bettering as a student
to a Master
who is guiding all the students to the
MDS
seats it is not exaggeration if you see
that most of the government seats in
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are from
our MDS conquerors but
I want to see that
most of the seats in all India should
also from our MDS Congress
you will do that sir thank you and uh
as srikanth explained now I am moving
why you want to do
PG
hope all of you
wanted to do PG and join here he has
explained you the different revenues
available to you as in
BDS graduate
the screen yes yes
foreign
there are different methods Technologies
of education system introduced by MDS I
used to appreciate during his student
life only uh he has utilized WhatsApp
method even though I am not uh before
the scene I was always behind the scene
finding out the questions he has posted
in the groups and I will be interacting
with the students whether you know it or
not I'm very much interested and uh
really I accepted when you have given me
this proposal to join the MDS conqueror
and definitely we will try to improve
the heights we'll try to raise the
heights of MDS puncturer and I promise
you there will be definite
the discussions and whenever as far as I
remember when I used to teach this
coaching methods
I think it is around uh last batch out
what is 2017 or 2016. and I promise you
the students you are free at any time to
disturb me even during two o'clock I
used to get WhatsApp messages
not only in Arco and you can post me
every doubts regarding the entrance
examination or guidance anything I am
very happy to join srikanth
so why we have come to join MDS here so
basically we are BDS BDS is a basic
degree
it doesn't have specializations
so at most I think any person want to
achieve is to achieve a scale new scale
in this production so wherever you go
MDS is a must it has become a
qualification whether we accept it or
not nowadays all the corporate hospitals
or other institutions they are asking
for MDS qualifications not only MDS
qualifications you should be well
skilled
is it enabled screening foreign
[Music]
how we are going to lead this 20023 to
2-4 batch
and
sir I hope now you you yeah sir is a
host now yes yes
I'm able to share my screen is it
visible on this is a visible side yes
yes this is what I used to tell my
students fast and steady
not steady
not only study stdy wins the race that
is very important aspect after
BDS for mdis preparation
and why I put aspiration preparations is
there will be a one percent aspiration
if you press fire 99 that's aspiration
has been only a few persons I can give
it and of course our srikant is one of
the persons I appreciate you srikanth
and remember there is always room at the
top what the thing you have to do is the
hard work respiration only maximum we
can Aspire you to one to five percent
and remaining is your third one another
thing is when I was discussing with the
students I always interact with saying
them remembering these two fellows great
fellows one is the Charles Darwin and
another is the Newton why I'm talking
about why we are discussing all these
cheese uh there is lot of competition
has increased so due to the increase in
cooperation there is what called a
struggle for existence uh between us so
those who are protests those who are
fittest will survive in this competition
so take it granted we make it fit we
make it prepare you for any type of
entrance examination in India we want to
see that our MDS conquerors should be in
first 10 places in all the entrances
from this 2023 to 24 batch
so up to BDS life is something different
you are in a pouch of safety like uh
kangaroo but we have to be you have to
be create a momentum we will create
momentum to prepare you for entrance
preparation which will give different
action you have to take the third
Newton's laugh and the reaction will be
the happiness you will get and the
results you will get at the end of
preparation so here we try to provide
you the what is called as the rate of
momentum for your entrance preparation
so one more thing I want to tell is the
best time to prepare is internship most
of the time I noticed many of these
students are enjoying like internship
and postponing the
entrance preparation I strongly suggest
that the internship is the best period
and always the first attempt is the best
attempt so you can enjoy your time but
not at the cost of your life so make a
decision to see that you should prepare
right okay enjoy one or two months okay
and next uh meat you are going to have
most probably all this time around March
2024 you will be having eight months of
sincere preparation eight points of
sincere preparation is required and it
doesn't mean that you should not prepare
right from the day you enter there and
internship and this is what we used to
have old Story the slow and steady
incidents but remember that that won't
fit for entrance preparation the only
thing is that
take a Time
have a leap forward that you should not
stop until you will get an MDS seed
that's why I always say fast and steady
wins the race and the first attempt is
the best attempt if you see the results
of PG entrances for the last 10 years
out of each uh the 70 to 80 percent
students are from first attempt only
so Time and Tide won't wait for anybody
and this is what focus on effective and
efficient preparation this is where you
need guidance and here with MDS conquer
we
provide this efficient and effective
methods as the technology is improving
as our Dr Society Madam as explained we
try to utilize this media different
sorts of media and make you go through
what all postings and what are all the
videos we have along with you prepared
for your benefit to go at any time that
means you can access this wherever and
whenever you are free
so try to dream to get a seat so getting
an MDS seat is easy I don't mean you to
get just only MDS seat and we want you
to get an MDS seat where you spend only
one paiser to Paisa to complete your MDS
that means I want to tell that all of
you should do a free MDS seat
so pgs is a 70 obvious
to all of our Pages there are 12 000 PG
seats but remember that only below
thousand seats are free of cost free of
cost no
uh this is the payment and non-payment
seats I think three count has explained
all this we have what is called as now
all India PG and PJ and uh aims and PGA
they have come under what is called as
uh the Institutes of national importance
examination I think from next match from
2024 they are trying to implement need
for these exams also so the need is
going to only the Gateway for your
getting to the MDS examination
after this is what I used to tell so
decide yourself what you want to do two
things one is free seat that the
government seat another is subject of
your choice the more the hard work you
put along the ladder the better the seat
you will get along with stipend other or
otherwise you are made to
pay this much of amount around up to 25
lakhs depending upon the quality
remember that always the money spent is
exponential by the end of three years if
you spend 10 lakhs per year this PG
course
and by the time you start earning you
will be almost all uh indirectly to say
that you will be spelling out 50 lakhs
to one crore which takes uh four or five
years if you are having a role in
practice so that's why I try to get a
free seat a good seat of course we are
here to guide you
and after you finish your precede then
you can invest and you can start a good
clinical practice with the money you had
and in your internship of course
internship for your PG curriculum and it
is highest degree in your field the
natural option you have to rise in your
field and specialization is important
and wherever you go outside and that is
they ask for either you go to Gulf or
any other corporate hospitals within
India the first thing is what
specialization you are having as an MDS
and second thing is from as as soon as
you enter into the
internship and if you want to settle in
dentistry whether it may be MDS or
something else you have to do mcqs it is
a must it is a part of your life better
it may be Gulf or it may be American
national birds or UK or anything is from
Tomorrow onwards if you want to stay for
higher studies in dentistry it should be
mcqs it should be your life it should be
your breath it should be your uh what
you drink what you have your food as
mcqs only if you want to stay in Dental
curriculum that's why what's wrong in
preparing for mcqs that are best to give
a chance for PG preparation so you can
see how the entrance is a preparation
differs from what you have learned in
various curriculum so our BDS curriculum
is entirely different from the entrance
system of oceans what they frame our
entering system of questions are most of
the times they are based on the American
textbooks and sometimes on the Britain
textbooks so if you go through this mcqs
it may become easy for you and another
thing is while you are preparing for PG
you can prepare for your national boards
also it takes some time for preparing
for national birds and getting to the
states meanwhile you can give a chance
and I have seen some students preparing
for entrance and they have finished
their MDS also before going to the
states and one more thing is be positive
in the approach and you will be backed
up by your uh they will be discouraging
your your seniors are immediately posted
seniors one thing remember that always
the survival of the fittest you should
have better skills always try to be in
the top slots when you try to aim at the
sky remember that you reach the top of
the tree that's what I wish and we
provide you to reach your top slots at
MDS conqueror from this year hope wish
you all the best and good future ahead

somebody has quoted about the forensic
background
yeah it's it's um nowadays the foreign
uh we are yes we are planning to start
the next batch probably after Pongal so
we are deciding on January 16th we are
going to start the fresh batch for 2024.
every week once we need a motivation
class so it's really difficult to stick
to the schedule being an intern
and that's where the these type of uh
what it's called as MDS entrance
preparation classes like MDS conquer
comes into the plate we try to motivate
and keep your spirits High
we will be sending you we will make the
reading process or the preparation
process uh easy for you
and definitely we'll try here to boost
your most equation Madam don't worry
about it
and for Australia also the Samsung Q
based question
uh first the Australia will be two parts
one is mcqs and second is the what is
called as um you have to do just like
your practical examination you have to
give part two
qualified
Australia part one you can give in India
even in Hyderabad also the centers are
there but part two you have to move to
Australia but the thing is I feel like
it is expensive it's a bit expensive you
fail you have to pay again five laks I
think the fees is for part two practical
exam is more I think like Indian around
four to five lakhs so if you fail again
you have to give one second thing about
Australia is they strictly follow the
dentist to population ratio they open
the openings only when the population
ratio is not up to the nominal ratio
that is given by Double H so whenever it
is beyond that they don't uh they don't
take the foreign foreign dentists okay
that is the main thing problem with the
first Australia
fellowships fellowships are also same
thing like this your PG only it is
nothing but your PG that Fellowship is
also you can complete uh in-house that
means in India itself but again for
practicals at least three to four months
you have to be in UK to get that
fellowships
UVA examination says it is a UA exam so
many exams are there depending upon the
country where you are going and expenses
What expenses exam expenses is around 20
000 to 30 000 maximum by checking your
credentials also and other expenses will
be there for uh your visa and all that
and for uh UAE for BDS I think they are
paying around one and a half to two
lakhs per month now
they're paying less
and uh
Army examination Army now it doesn't
have it it's not having any separate
exam now it is with the neet exam now
you have to sit for a neat examination
and neat results are taken as the
qualification Mark for uh Army entrance
so these Army entrants has uh once you
get into the army there are two types
one is short-term is commission and uh
another is long Service Commission or
permanent commission short Service
Commission is five years within this
five years after three years you can
take a chance they will have the
entrance system like again you have take
a chance and you prove yourself that
your fit worth do a very permanent
commission officer then if once you
qualify their exam after three years you
will be permitted to do PG anywhere in
India on Paleo that means you will be
paid full month salaries for three years
you can do that once you complete that
you will become a permanent officer in
army
but 2024 July session we cannot tell it
anymore actually it will be three months
before the notification of the
examination we have to wait and see how
the notifications because previously it
is uh that by the May 1st or May 31st by
the end of May 31st all the PG courses
should start in India there is
depression for the last two three years
they are trying to channelize and make
it again a regular stream we have to
wait and see
not only USA people uh considered MDS
degree they even don't consider the
videos degree from UK or European
countries it is a system what we follow
in each country to protect their
citizens they should prove that they are
worth it and they are more skilled to
treat their own citizens it is not like
USA or any discrimination it is all
countries only in the Indian degree BDS
degree is directly recognized by UAV
Maldives and some West Indies of course
some African countries but uh you will
again still you have to do a
qualification examination remember that
only where you need not do any
qualification exam is uh uh given Sri
Lanka you qualification examination I
think only in UE also they will conduct
what is called as uh promate or some
qualification examination without any
qualifying examination a second
country's BDS degree is not recognized
by any of the countries in the world
you have to see the notification they
will issue guidelines and all the new
universities which are there in the neat
of umbrella yeah more than 15 deemed
colleges are there with the need you can
you can go with the need counseling
itself a few colleges uh the counselings
will be done through the state and few
directly the colleges will fill the
seats but neat rank is mandatory for
every any admission you have to qualify
need you have to get a rank in need not
a qualification rank no rank has become
very important
Singapore MDS you have to prove your
credentials not only your education
system how much your aptitude to do an
MDS that you have to have some
credentials like uh your Publications or
any other skills and again you have to
clear your basic BDS recognition
examination then only you can join in
MDS
yes all European countries apart from a
qualifying examination they have some
English Examination for all the Asian
countries you have to qualify the
English examination as the first
examination point before entering into
the European countries apart from that
each country has a qualifying
examination it is a rule
and uh MDS in India or abroad why do you
want to do abroad I don't know now the
mdas we have uh best colleges in India
itself
I think uh
you can post your doubts at any time
we are ready to clarify all the notes
thanking you thank you srikanth thank
you saithi madam
thank you sir thank you so much
thank you thank you very much
thank you
okay guys uh we are done for now any
more questions uh before we close the
session
you can post you can post the doubts so
I hope this session is like more
informative I mean like first of all we
should know what is happening then we
should know whether we can fit into that
or not whether we can survive in that or
not whether we can reach that Financial
limitations or not whether we can uh I
mean like whether your parents are open
for that or not so there are many other
things that few things we have to
discuss with your parents and come out
then we can uh like plan accordingly
okay next one how much would should
score to get into gdc's for a
reservation it's not about scores core
varies like for example uh if the
question paper is too easy
uh if you know all 240 questions you'll
only keep few questions and come or your
item 12 to 40. so if the question paper
is easy then the cutoffs will vary but
ranks will never vary ranks is always
same like for example uh an open
category uh to be in all India like to
crack government Dental College through
all India counseling we should have a
rank of at least 350 below
okay and if you're having any background
of OBC reservation OBC is almost like uh
almost like an OC it is somewhere around
350 to 400 all India you should be 350
to 400 all India to get an OBC uh OBC
seat okay and ews has an extra Edge
compared to OBC uh but ews we cannot
predict how many AWS people will be
there in the top list like as of now 500
550 600 also ews seats are coming uh
there is only to the National level but
not in the uh state level okay and next
course as C category
um like even 201500 you can keep 1500 or
1200 as a Target if you are 1200 or 1500
below all India you are getting a good
clinical seat
for an st it will be two thousand two
thousand uh all India below you will get
a good clinical seat and coming to
pH physically handicapped the number
number of students retenting physically
handicapped will vary like very Less in
dentistry but you need to have a proper
certificate that is being approved by
the central government for that and uh
sometimes they are going to keep one one
seat at least like one seat uh sometimes
if the seed is not filled through
physically handicapped let's see it will
be shifted to open category in the
second round of counseling so this is
for all India counseling State
counseling it's going to vary because
every state has a different pattern of
reservations for example you take
Telangana and Adra we have something
called as we don't have an OBC we have
we have a BCA bcbcde something like that
and similarly Maharashtra has a
different pattern of uh reservations for
them and similarly Karnataka has a
different pattern of reservation so they
have their sub categories of reservation
so basing upon that uh it will it vary
from State it varies to all India that's
all that's all about uh reservations
anything more guys
yeah let's start the preparation okay it
will be difficult for the first few
weeks but if you work hard because the
first few weeks are going to determine
your character like people who stands or
withstands in the first one two months
so no one can stop you but most of the
people they fail to reach that first two
months they start reading for five days
or 10 days or 15 days they come to a
conclusion that we cannot read we cannot
do this it is very difficult to
understand this year it is not possible
so they come out with an options like
Plan B and plan C joining a clinic or
enjoying the internship or doing
something in internship uh and finally
everyone everyone you me and everyone
will definitely give the examination and
they feel bad after the result so this
is what regularly I Monitor and I see
from my students from the past seven to
eight years so I strongly recommend to
break that first one to two months talk
with the mentors take their suggestions
first two months if you cross no one can
stop you no one can break you by
reaching your goals and by reaching your
good rank okay anything more before we
close the session
okay guys okay rest everything I hope
you have our number uh okay so and I are
always available on the groups okay so
whenever you want you have anything to
discuss okay so gauri Shankar sir will
be there uh a legendary person with lots
of knowledge and wisdom to guide us in
in a better pattern okay so that is the
reason why I always take suggestions I I
always love to talk with my hoodies with
my particularly with my H buddies
whenever I go to college and interaction
I used to sit with the principal so it
sure is there and I used to just hear
their words because they have lots of
wisdom with their experience wisdom is
most important thing in the Dentistry
you can just learn just by hearing them
their experiences their what they came
across in their life and everything
though that that's what I get motivated
from them I love to talk with my H body
always okay so bye take care uh anything
ma'am
yeah so I'll be glad that if you join
and if you start the preparation during
internship itself okay yeah initial days
it could be little tough but don't worry
you're not pulling the Rope alone we are
behind you who's helping you out in
every day every moment so if you try to
pull it alone you will definitely feel
it to be tough but if you take help from
us guidance from us the things will be
easy and comfortable so do
get into this irrespective of what you
are going to do after your internship
either you want to go to the abroad or
you want to stay in India anything the
main platform or the basics is doing the
mcqs okay so you can't sit today and
think after two years what you're going
to do so during internship rather than
wasting your precious time because
already you are into clinicals so you
will have that exposure at the same time
if you start doing this mcqs pattern you
will be having an ease and an edge over
others so definitely try to be and even
the repeaters if you are interested
definitely you will have an edge when
compared to any other students across
the country okay so try to be positive
always and try to be in touch so if you
are in touch with each Mentor in our
team you will be definitely be at the
top so don't hesitate at any point of uh
time we are here with you so we'll be
handling your hand if you trust us we'll
catch your hand and will not leave your
hand until till we throw you in your
respective dream Department in a dream
college you might leave a hand but we
will not leave you okay so trust us and
be with us we'll be glad to be in touch
with you yeah so have a nice day
yeah that's all guys okay uh Advance

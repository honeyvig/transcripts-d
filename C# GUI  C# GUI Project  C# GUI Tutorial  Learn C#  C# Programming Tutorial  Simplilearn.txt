hey everyone i am peppa khandelwal and i
welcome you all to yet another exciting
video on simply learns youtube channel
in this session we will be discussing
c-sharp graphical user interface
throughout this session we will take the
help of visual studio to demonstrate the
gui features
however before we begin with this
session make sure you have subscribed to
our youtube channel and clicked on the
bell icon below so you never miss an
update from simply learn's youtube
channel
first let's discuss what is a gui
the graphical user interface gui is a
user interface that allows users to
interact with technologies by using
graphical icons rather than a heavy code
the graphical user interface invented by
xerox palo alto research lab in late
1970s and is commercially available in
apple's macintosh and microsoft's
windows operating system
the gui design pattern is based on the
model view controller software
architecture which separates the
internal information representation from
how information is displayed to the user
now let's get started with the demo
we will open the visual studio and
discuss various gui features available
to demonstrate gui
let's create a project gui demo
we will create the windows form
application project
so
windows
form app
dot net framework
we will click next
we will name it
gui demo
and create
it will take some time to be created
let's name this
as gui demo
let's start with the button
we will name it as
click
here
let's increase its size to 11.
let's run it
as you can see here is the button
right now it's it doesn't do anything
when we click it
let's close this and write up the code
for it
we will double click on it
and here the form one dot cs is
displayed
now we will write a code for it so we
will write message
box
dot
show
and we will type like welcome
to
simply learn
and we will close it by semicolon
now let's run this
now when i click this button it shows
this box
with the ok button let's click the ok
button
and close it
now suppose i want to give it more
interactability
so now
i will create a dialog box
dialog result
dr
equals to message box dot show
welcome to simply
learn let's change this text as well
and write it as
like
do you
want
to close
this
window
we can give it a confirm dialog box as
well
now we will use an enum which will be
the message
box button
buttons dot
yes no
button we will
and we will also use
message box
icon
dot questions to give it more icons
now we will make an if statement
to ask if we press yes then we will
cross this form so
we'll write
f
dr
equals to dialog box dot result
is equals to yes
then
we will
write this dot
close
now let's run this
now when i click this button it will
show this box
now if i press no then it doesn't do
anything but just close that message box
now if i press yes
then it will close that form as well
now let's use more functions from this
toolbox
let's take some labels and textbox and
another button
so i will take a label
a name is a
username
i will increase its size
by 11.
let's copy and paste this
now i will change the name to
password
now let's add
now let's add a button
repeat
repeat
repeat
repeat
now
let's add some text box
we will increase their size
and
a button
i will name it
as sign up
and its size as 11.
now by default this text box takes
the text value
but in case of password text box we can
change it
we can change its password care as
anything we want
let's make it star
now when i run this code
here let me write like webhub
and for the password whenever i type
anything
it will show star
now
we can also change it
to a default according to our
system so we will keep it simple and we
will use do system password care and
make it true
now when we run this
since my system is a windows operating
system so whenever write anything
in this password it will be typed as
a bold dot symbol
let's rename this click here as well to
close
since it performs a close operation
now let's add some more features
let's add some radio button
and a label
let this label be
gender
and its size
as 11
and we will change its size as well to
11.
and its name
to
male
and this one to female
now let's run this
as you can see we can only select one of
these so it will give us the opportunity
to select either one of the option
now let's add a check box as well
i will increase its size to 11
and for the text
we will use
like
i understand
and
i
accept
terms
and
conditions
now
let's run this
as you can see we can write any username
here
and password
as well as we can choose either male or
female
and we can also click on this
now let's suppose i want
this button to be only a bill available
when
i click on this checkbox
so i will write i will go to this button
and
change the enabled
function
from true to false
now when i run this code
it shows as not enabled
now i want the functionality when i
click this check button it gets enabled
so
we will write the code for this checkbox
so button
to
dot
enabled
is equals to
check box dot checked
now
let's run this
so web hub
any password
i like i can select pl if you will and
when i click this this button gets
available
now let's suppose i have more radio
buttons
instead of the only these two
let's make space for that
let's add another
label
and i will name it as
payment
method
and size to be as 11.
and i will add
some radio buttons
i will increase its size to 11
same with this one
this one as well
now i will name this one
as
credit
slash
debit
card
this one
is not banking
and this one
as paper
now let's run this code
now whenever i
make this code so let's let me write a
username and a password
and let me select mail
now whenever i go to select this payment
method it unselects the gender so
basically we can only create one of
these five radio button
now
to make them separate we need to use
containers
so
we will use
group box container
so group box
i can increase its size
i will remove the name group box from it
and we will select these buttons and put
it in this group box
i will drag it here
same with this one so i will add another
group box
and add these in it
and also remove the name of
this group box
and
i will drag it to this one
now let's run this code again
let me save it and run
now
wherever
the password
then
i can now select male or female and i
can also select any of these payment
methods and when i click this then i can
select this sign up button
now for this signup buttons
code
i will write as message
box
dot show
and write
account
is
created
and
i will make
this
dot
close
let's run this
so now
i make an account
password
then i select mail
and then in networking then click then
as a now account is created and it will
close this function

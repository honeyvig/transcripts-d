hi everyone this is Dr Sati team MDS
conquer so now I'm going to discuss the
case based radiographic diagnosis so
here with I've presented little clinical
scenario of the cases so wherein the
patient will give you the chief
complaint there are some symptoms and
also a clinical presentation will be
there along with it there is a
radiograph okay so based on the clinical
presentation and based on the findings
that we get in a radiograph that is
given for that particular case we have
to arrive at that diagnosis okay so that
is nothing but the case based
radiographic discussion so which we are
going to do now so coming to the first
one so here a patient has presented to a
clinic and on routine radiographic
examination the patient had mixed ropic
radiolucent lesion which was involving
more than one quadrant okay and the very
important point to be noted is the teeth
were vital so there was no problem with
the teeth the associated teeth were
vital so what is your diagnosis so now
let's look at the radiograph so if you
see here the teeth are vital and you can
see some lesions which are present
involving the quadrants so there's no
clinical symptom which is being given by
the patient this was seen as a
radiographic finding only because the
teeth are vital and there are no
symptoms related to the teeth or any
problem with the teeth then you have to
go for a cement oous displasia so this
cement oous displasia either it occur
can occur as periapically so if it is
present only with one single tooth it is
called as periapical C OES displasia and
if you can see it in one or more areas
then you can go for focal cement OES
displasia and if it is involving more
than one or two quadrants then you have
to go for fluid cement oous displasia so
here you can see more L of lesion so you
can go for flid cement oous displasia
and it can occur at three stages so
first one it will be simple radiolucency
next is a mixed radioopaque radiolucent
lesion and at times it can be completely
radioopaque also okay so this is
regarding the cement toes displasia so
since it's just a radiographic finding
and the teeth are vital you can go for
cement oous
displasia okay now coming to the next
case so here there's an young adult
patient who has developed swelling and
he has also noticed a symmetry in his
mailla 4 years back okay so underline
there is a symmetry of the phase and it
is since 4 years so he has noticed that
since 4 years okay so it's been a long
time and it is young adult patient even
that you have to underline next the
swelling was very firm in consistency
and it is painless so it is actually
painless and it was firm in consistency
now let's see the radaph so a radaph was
taken so it's a Advanced Imaging
technique the CT was taken and if you
see there is a radio opes lesion with
expansion of the maxilla right so there
is involvement of the sinus and also
there is expansion which goes in favor
of a fibro oous leion which is nothing
but fibrous
displasia Okay so so here if you see
there is expansion and based on the
symptoms that is given by the patient
that it is a symmetry was observed and
it is not much painful it is painless
and it was very firm inconsistency and
on a radiographic examination you can
also see that it's clearly evident when
you compare with the other side it's
clearly evident that it is involving the
sinus as well and there is an expansion
then you have to go for a fibrosus
legion which is nothing but the fibrous
dysplasia okay so this is our second
case now coming to the third one so here
a patient has
developed a swelling from the past 3
months so there's only swelling since
past 3 months and he had pain in the
associated teeth for which he had to
undergo extractions of the offending
teeth so very important Point already
given in the question that is onion peel
or onion skin appearance so quite simple
diagnosis I think it is already roaming
in your mind so here it is orogenic
origin because the teeth were painful
and he had to undergo extraction and
there was a swelling which the patient
has observed the radiographic
examination has shown the onion peel
appearance so this is an axile section
which has shown the onion peel
appearance clearly right so that goes in
favor of Osteo myus the GES or the
proliferative Osteo myus gives this
peculiar onion skin or onion peel
appearance okay so B
besides the Osteo myus the proliferative
osto myus there's one
more condition or one more disease which
also shows this onion skin appearance
which is nothing but eving saroma okay
even in eving saroma you can find out
this onion peel or onion skin appearance
but it commonly eving saroma occurs in
children and very young gettles and the
patient will most probably complain a
pain in the bone okay bone pain will be
there and obviously it will not have
such similar symptoms right so orogenic
symptoms will not be there right so you
have to go for eving saroma if the case
is given otherwise like if it is a young
patient or a child is given and pain in
the bone then you have to go for eving
saroma because it's not orogenic right
so both these cases have the similar
aerographic presentation of having onion
skin and Oran peel appearance but the
clinical findings will be different So
based on that you have to arrive at the
diagnosis okay next coming to the other
case so here the patient has discolored
teeth and you can see on examinations
there's some translucent Hue that can be
seen on examination so the radiographic
findings are as follows so coming to the
diagnosis so underlining point is a
translucent Hue
okay so if you see now there's a
translucent Hue and the radio graph if
you see there are no pulp Chambers the
pulp Chambers are obliterated if you can
zoom and see you can see that the pulp
Chambers are completely obliterated so
that's nothing but the shell teeth right
so shell teeth and having such
translucent Hue it's nothing but very
simple I think you must have already
come to the answer it is dentinogenesis
imperfect right so this is how the
questions can be as they can post a
clinical picture they can give you the
symptoms and they'll post a radiographic
picture as well and they'll ask you to
come for the diagnosis so it's quite
simple the only thing I want to suggest
is read word by word Line to Line
underline the points and give complete
look to the diagram observe the diagram
completely okay where exactly the
abnormality is and what are the findings
that you can get out of the diagram that
is given based on that you have to come
to your diagnosis don't be in a hurry to
come to your diagnosis first note one by
one and then give your diagnosis okay
now coming to the other case here a
patient has developed a swelling in the
jaw 6 months back that has gradually
increased to the present size and the
radiographically there was expansion of
the cortical plate with a multilocular
lesion very important point to be
underlined and there is a swelling okay
and there's a expansion of the cortical
plate now let's see the
radaph very pretty clear the radiograph
shows a expansion of the cortical plate
multilocular Hazard lesion and also
there is resorption of the roots of the
associated teeth right so this is
nothing but a benign tumor which is
showing this presentation which is
orogenic origin which is nothing but the
emo blastoma Soo blastoma has this
cortical expansion the xshell cracking
effect right and also knife as
resorption of the roots will be there
and a multilocular lesion so all these
goes in favor of the emo blastoma okay
so it's pretty clear if you see the
diagram If You observe if you know all
the findings of radiographic findings of
emo blastoma then you can easily arrive
at the diagnosis so number one is first
the location right if you see it is
posterior mandible number one number two
s is the periphery and shape if you see
the periphery and shape it is il defined
there's expansion of the cortical plate
and it's completely involving the it is
like shape is also completely IL defined
and it's completely involving the entire
posterior mandible right so that is a
second thing third thing internal
structure internal structure if you see
it is multilocular right fourth thing
effect on the surrounding structures if
you see the fourth Point effect on the
surrounding structures there is a knife
edge resorption of the associated teeth
so four steps fifth step formulat your
diagnosis go for emo blastoma clear I
hope it is clear
okay now coming to the next case here a
patient has developed a severe bone pain
in his limbs okay so there is a bone
pain so patient himself complains that
the pain is within his bone and he has
also observed a mild swelling now the
radiograph has shown as given in the
picture so your diagnosis so this is an
important point to be underlined so
let's see the radiograph now now if you
see the radio graph there is a elevation
of the per periosteum which is giving
this
triangle appearance which is nothing but
the cadman's
triangle right if such presentation of a
limb of a long bone is given with a
elevated periosteum giving this quadman
triangle appearance blindly go for
osteosarcoma osteosarcoma has the cman
triangle appearance of the long bones so
directly you can go for Osteo saroma
okay coming to the next case so here a
patient has presented with pain and
swelling which was felt over the
salivary gland area so whenever a
salivary gland is involved if you think
that the patient is having a problem
with the salivary gland then always
better to do a contrast Imaging so
obviously first we'll go for an
ultrasound but if we can't find anything
out of it always is better to go for a
contrast Imaging okay so radiographic
presentation is as follows if you see
the picture it gives a idea of
a hot dog or a sausage string appearance
so if you see there's a sausage string
appearance which is seen in the
radiograph right so here the patient was
having a problem with or a pain and
swelling related to salivary gland and
the radiograph has shown sausage string
appearance
right so it's nothing but inflammation
of the salivary gland duct okay the duct
of the salivary gland has been inflamed
which has given this hot dog or sausage
string appearance which is also called
as Silo doiis okay so this is silo
doritis clear so the picture the
radiographic picture is very very
important for you to come or arrive at a
good diagnosis okay so there will be
options given like jrin syndrome or uh
pintis or citis okay so xyo oitis
sausage string appearance jrin syndrome
cherry blossom appearance cytis leafless
tree appearance benign tumor ball in
hand appearance so all these appearances
is quite important for you to know and
if you have to also have the
radiographic picture in your brain okay
because you know the names of all the
appearances but how they look also you
need to know so that's the reason I've
posted here so it is citis which is
nothing but the inflammation of the
salivary gland duct which gives this
saus string or hot dog appearance
okay now next coming to the come
directly radiograph so I'll ask the
question so here a patient was having a
swelling and he has underwent the
extraction of the impacted tooth and the
radiograph has shown this okay so there
is a unilocular radiolucency with a thin
got like thin R Opa border around it and
the associated roots of the teeth are
normal there is no problem with the
adjacent teeth right so it's a simple
unilocular lesion which is having an
anop posterior expansion so that's
nothing but OKC OKC has this anop
posterior expansion it will not have
much of Bol lingual expansion it will
have this anop posterior expansion and
besides that the associated or the
adjacent teeth will not go much of
resorption they will be not like like
you most commonly it's I'm not saying
always most commonly it will not show
any resorption of the teeth that is
present adjacent to it okay so that goes
in favor of okas so there is anop poster
expansion which you can clearly see in
the picture and the associated the
appear to be normal there is no much
resorption so that is nothing but the
OKC okay OK again either it can occur as
unilocular or or multilocular right but
here it is a unilocular presentation
okay next coming to the this case so
here a patient has underwent an implant
and few months after the placement of
the implant he has developed sever pain
and also there was a discharge of pass
from his ging sulkus okay when a
radiograph is taken there you can see
there is a radiolucency which is
surrounding that particular implant so
if you see there's radi s see here so
it's a simple case of a perimplantitis
okay so the implantitis where the
inflammation occurs around the implant
it's nothing but the perimplantitis okay
so it's a very simple
case now next go for the other case so
here if you see a patient has now again
I'll ask the question so her patient has
presented with a discolored tooth and uh
the teeth are when the clinical picture
was taken the teeth were like this so
you can see here and there there will be
a r opaque or more R opacity of the
teeth or sorry not R OPAC opacity the
the teeth were more white in color okay
so the on the clinical presentation here
and there the teeth were more white in
color and the radio graph it is not that
clearly shown here has given a snow
capped appearance if I ask you I'll put
the clinical presentation if the
question is asked so before seeing this
picture the patient has presented with
discoloration of the teeth okay and
there were more opaque or more white
areas here and there over the teeth and
the radiograph has shown snow capid
teeth so what is your diagnosis so
wherever you see the snow capid
appearance in a OPG then you have to go
for hypomaturation type of amelogenesis
imp perfector okay hypoplastic type
shows picket fence appearance whereas no
capid teeth is presented with the
hypomaturation type of hemogenesis
imperfecta okay so that is regarding
this case okay so we are done with
almost 10 case presentations now so how
the case will be asked what what is
interpretation you have to get from your
radiograph and what is or what could be
your diagnosis okay among the four
options more appropriate diagnosis you
have to give okay now I'll post some
questions for you so I expect you you to
give your answers in the comment section
below okay you can give your answers as
1 2 and three so what is your answer for
number one question what is the answer
for number two question and what is the
answer for number three question okay
after a day or two I will post the
answers in the comment session okay so
with this you can even get to practice
of how to answer these radioraps or the
case based discussions right so coming
to the first question so
here just radiograph okay radiograph was
presented and you can see an Arrow
showing a little and large surface over
the root right so if You observe that
what is your radiographic diagnosis and
in what all conditions will you find
this okay so my question is there is an
abnormality here okay along the root the
arrow Mark which is showing so what is
your diagnosis and in what conditions do
you find this radiographic finding okay
so there is an abnormality there so what
is that abnormality and where all can
you see okay so that is your first
question coming to the second question
so here there are multiple Arrow marks
which are being shown here right so the
patient has bone pain he has severe pain
in the Jaws so a radiograph is taken now
if you see there are multiple lesions
which are seen as round punched lesions
I've already given the hint so what is
your diagnosis
okay so bone pain and multiple lesions
which are small small like a punched out
lesions which are involving the Jaws so
what is your diagnosis so this is your
second
question so coming to the third question
so here there's a child who has
presented with bilateral asymmetric
enlargement of the Jaws okay so there is
asymmetric enlargement of the Jaws and
the Jaws are so bulky as you can see
there's choppy cheeks are there and the
3D three Di men image has shown
multilocular lesion right so if you see
a 3D image this is a three-dimensional
image right so and also the teeth appear
to be floating here and there right so
what could be your diagnosis right so
these are the three questions
so that's it so I expect you to answer
in the comment session
below after a day or two after all of
you has given your answers I'll post the
correct answer answers okay so these are
the three questions so if you make
yourself habituate to answer such type
of case based discussions it will be
easy for you in the exam as well because
I know you have studied a lot but
practice makes you more perfect okay so
that's why I expect you to answer okay
don't think if you give a wrong answer
what will I think okay I'm not going to
judge you this is not the exam okay so
give your answers whatever you feel so
that it makes you perfect okay thank
you

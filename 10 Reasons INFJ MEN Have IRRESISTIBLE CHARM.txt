what makes a person charming
is it the way they talk the way they
walk
their wits and talents it could actually
be all of these
being the rarest in the population
there's no doubt how infj types have
qualities and traits to die for
their mix and match of quirky and
adorable make them stand out from the
rest
it's no wonder how infj men become
instant chick magnets
with their undeniable charisma but what
really makes these infj
men special i'm going to show you the 10
reasons
infj men have irresistible charm
number 10 their gentle gaze infj types
don't have the prettiest
faces of all the personality types but
they have the most beautiful eyes
there's something about how infj types
draw their attention to something
they seem to wander far away with their
eyes
it's as if they use their eyes to see
through your soul
knowing that infj types seek intimate
soul connections
rather than surface level conversations
but even if their eyes are not
locked on you and even if they're not
within your reach but in your sight
you still want to lay your eyes on them
viewing them from afar
observing how they connect with
themselves and get drenched in their
thoughts
an infj may stare at you for hours but
they don't give off that creepy vibe
that puts you away instead an infj's
gaze is gentle
not intimidating but mysterious it's
unexplainable how their eyes through
their gaze
speak so much language guess this is one
of the many ways they're truly
irresistible
the eyes spark the charm number nine
they're comforting silence being
introverts in nature who are private and
reserved people
infj types embrace silence as their
element
for an infj silence is power in a lot of
things
that matter to them infj types are known
to be listeners
not talkers so if you don't start a
conversation with an infj
chances are you would be sitting there
with them in deafening silence
but that's not exactly the case every
time the silence you share with an infj
is not
awkward well not for the first few
minutes
but it's comforting they use silence as
their power to influence you to also get
in touch with the things surrounding you
it's as if silence is their tool to draw
your attention to you
and your world and in a situation like
this
you can't just resist sitting under a
sky full of stars
appreciating nature in your own quiet
ways in the comforting silence
with an infj whose charm continues to
draw you in
a picture-perfect moment you truly not
miss
number eight their speaking voice infj
types as typical introverts don't speak
much
but when they do their voice resonates
across borders
infj types are not fans of small talk
so they seldom use their voice in simple
conversations on a daily basis
however they make use of their voice in
greater causes
hence infj types are labeled as
advocates
who use their voice to make an impact in
narrow and wider angles of things
they don't speak much but they speak of
substance
when they speak you just can't help but
keep your mouth shut
and get lost in their thoughts you
appreciate their voice
all the more the words that come out
with it you couldn't get enough of how
their voice also speaks so much volume
of charm
what do you think about a man who can
sound very gentle but it's actually very
tough
number seven the remarkable first
impressions
looking at their physical appearance
infj types blend in with other
personality types
they don't display a bold statement in
their looks but they make first
impressions last other personality types
view infj types as knobs cold-hearted
because of the way they stare and the
fact that they don't initiate
conversations
but once you get to know ifj types they
prove you wrong
there's just something about them being
enveloped in some kind of mystery
a peculiar kind of charm that tries to
pull you
in the way they last an impression with
the way they looked and act
is not strong but remarkable enough for
you to remember them
a tiny detail about the first time you
encounter an infj
makes you curious to get to know them
more and that's an unexplainable charm
over there
number six their listening ears it has
always been a great advantage for a man
to be a great listener
girls would fall for that any time who
wouldn't be
but in this generation these types of
men are present but
hard to be found especially infj men
of all the personality types infj types
are the best listeners
you can spend hours talking to these
people they wouldn't mind at all
they're empathic and they want to make
sure that your vulnerabilities are
sealed safely with them
with eyes that see without judgment and
ears ready to listen
how much more if their hearts come in
the picture this just testifies how infj
types are the perfect recipes to
irresistible charm
number five their non-negotiable
conviction and principles
nothing is more irresistible than a
person who is grounded with principles
and thus his action with conviction this
makes an infj oozing with charm
having principles is like having a road
map to your future
you always have a guide in anything you
do keeping you morally upright and
stable
also a person who means what he says and
says what he means
a person with conviction is worth the
keeps with infj men having this
it's no doubt how people find them so
alluring this just adds so many points
to the charm meter of an infj number
four
their unexplainable depth for someone
who thinks a lot
or someone who spends most of his time
overthinking or wondering what's going
to happen
depth could actually grow they try to be
careful with their words
actions and responses towards others
infj
types don't just swim and float they
dive they don't just settle with shallow
things over the surface
but they go beyond that their
introverted intuition allows them
to magnify matters to reach the soul
conversations with infj types
are deep and meaningful that you
wouldn't want to end
the more you exchange thoughts the more
your soul connects
and the more you dive with an infj the
more you can't resist their charm
number three if they have common
interests
while others prefer how opposites
attract infj
types believe that common interests are
more interesting
common interests are not just plainly
common
but they are the starting blocks to
creating more connections
these make them more engaged and drawn
into getting to know you more
you may be thinking what if there's
nothing common to both of you anymore
infj types have more questions before
you run out of common interests
and as for you you're given another
reason to appreciate an infj even more
number two their sensitivity it's quite
known to others that the infj is
actually quite a sensitive person
despite how they appear to be another
dominant characteristic of an infj
is its sensitivity to his own and to
others
they don't want anyone to get hurt so
they are extra cautious in taking care
of their own
and others emotions the infj would
always put others first
before them and might appear selfless to
some
they think of anything in multiple
lenses to avoid making regrets
if this is how an infj treats you who
would want to resist this
right number one they're being genuine
infj types are the most genuine among
the personality types
they're not afraid to show who they
truly are they're blunt on first dates
in the most transparent or indirect way
they may not speak much but they speak
with sense
which may or may not hurt you this
genuinity
among infj types makes them a special
kind of quirky
that you would want to cherish infj
types don't have the perfect looks
that match your standards but they have
hearts that are authentic and generous
if this isn't irresistible enough for
you i don't know what else will
all in all infj men are charming in
different angles and views
they have their own kind of special
written all over their dictionary
there could be different kinds of charms
from different kinds of people
what could also be charming for one
might not be charming for the other
it's again all a matter of choice what
are the things that you find charming in
infj men
do you find these reasons charming and
irresistible too

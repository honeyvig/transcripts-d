- I wonder if in your
conversations or in your research,
there are examples of
building a skills pipeline or
developing the workforce of the future, to
ensure that the workforce is
ready for this disruption.
- I always like to start
with the people aspect
because we are at the junction,
at a point in history where,
I like to say, virtually
there's nothing technology
cannot do today, Greg.
It is up to the leader,
having a very different
vision of the future,
the leader's ability to execute and create
a different culture
and bring others along.
So to that end, empowering the workforce
and dealing with workforce transformation
is one of those very,
very important pillars.

- What is the dream at MTorres
of how AI can be used in the future?
- Yes, well, our vision
is that our machines
that are, very automatic,
but they still need one
operator of the machine,
using them, as the
process is very special,
this operator has also to
become an expert of the process
to be able to run the
part and lay out the part.
So, this knowledge you have
to transfer to the operator.
Okay?
And the operators are very,
moving between different,
in an industry, between different lines
and it's always difficult to have some,
experienced workers there.
So our dream is that, the
machine can be self-aware
what is happening in the
environment, in the material,
on the machine, on the
process, on the whole plant,
be able to self-verify, auto tune,
and even anticipate
problems and make decisions
or at least propose decisions to a human.
Okay?
So we currently see that,
our machines will not have
humans operating the machine,
but human supervising
and coordinating the work
of the machines

- AI is essential not only
to business operations,
but to society.
Give us a sense of the conversations
that you're having with customers.
- The number one
conversation that we're doing
a little bit of, kind
of creating awareness
and education around,
is this job elimination.
- Yeah.
- There's that myth.
Our research suggests that yes,
jobs will change and 75 million jobs
in the manufacturing space will go away,
but 133 million new jobs will be created.
As we move from agriculture
as a society to industrial,
we had, Greg, perhaps a hundred years ago,
50% of the workforce in agriculture.
Now we have like less than 2%
but we have historically very,
very high levels of employment,
because what we did as a
society, we changed the profile,
the demographics of the workforce.
Now it's time that we do.
We go through another wave
and then we have to go
through that together.

- How do you think about
ensuring that Tetra Pak
has the right skilled
workforce for the future?
What solutions, what
recommendations do you have?
- We have a program called Future Talent
where we bring in quite
a lot of people directly
from university every year.
We try to, we recruit from
slightly different places now
of course with slightly
different education
with these type of, you know, data science
and other type of information
technology educations.
Then when they start working,
I think it's very important
that they quickly realize
that they have to learn
the practical reality
of industrial processes as well.
Because you can't put
together fantastic algorithms
that solve a problem that
doesn't exist of course.
So if you don't understand
the problems that do occur
in real manufacturing
processes, you will designs,
you know, the likelihood
of designing something
that actually solves a
problem, is not so high.
So being interested in
how it is, you know,
spend time on factory
floors, travel the world,
we always introduce them
and send them to customers.
They have to be on the factory floor,
they have to operate
machines so they understand
what type of problems.
They have to work with
people who understand that.

and pin comment Microsoft Excel so
Microsoft Excel is a software product
designed and developed by Microsoft
storing data in an organized way that is
Heros and columns and Microsoft Excel is
also capable to manipulate data through
some mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel so
following are some fundamentals that you
need to know before getting started with
Microsoft Excel so basically when you
install the Microsoft Office in your
computer you will have various Microsoft
products out of which Microsoft Excel is
one of the product so we will be dealing
exactly with that particular product
that is Microsoft Excel so when you get
started with Microsoft Excel this is
what you will see in the first page so
this particular page is called as
Microsoft Excel homepage where you will
be having various varieties of sheets
Microsoft Excel will give you some
suggestions based on the type of sheet
you want to work with we will see this
in in a better way through the Practical
session so once you get started with the
sheet you will have some more options so
this particular option is called as the
toolbar menu you will have the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help so these are the
tools that you will be using to work on
your data using Microsoft Excel
furthermore we have a toolbar ribbon so
when you select some of the other option
from the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help buttons you will have a ribbon so
for example you can see that I have
selected the Home Tool here so when I
press on the Home Tool this is the
ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives me so
this ribbon has some options in it which
can perform various operations now in a
further more detailed way we will have
toolbar groups so when you see in the
previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the font bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions so
each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialogue box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of operations which are not able to
be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the rule
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet tracker in the bottom left
corner of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets and in
the bottom right corner you have an
option of increasing or decreasing the
sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session these are the
field just look at there in today's era
I'm telling you guys in today's era
every you know like every type of
business needs to do analysis on it why
because now getting the information
about the customers
from the customers to the customers is
now is a very easy task for the company
it's very easy see just imagine last 10
to 15 years before it was a very tough
task the company was doing the survey
the people were standing on the road
having a a hard copy paper and pen and
they're asking a question sir how about
the products uh you're using this one
how was the feedback and all what is the
quality and all right so maintaining
this was a very tough job but now every
company has their own mobile application
before buying the product you will you
will get the you know uh the mobile
application and whatever you do in their
app everything is tracking everything is
keeping as a record on the basis of it
they're creating a decision on it right
they're creating a planning of it I'm
just giving you a small U example here
think about it I will ask a question
give me a respon but listen the question
first I'm sure everyone has taken an
Uber right I'm sure about it okay so
sometime before I book a c driver came
and he went he take me to my destination
once I reach to my destination everybody
right then um no driver completes his
duty he deserve to get a payment I
reached to my destination I am liable to
Fe the amount but in between this
situation the driver ask me to do one
extra things and that is sir please give
me a five star rating then I'm just
wondering like driver deserve a payment
I am liable to pay the amount then why
what is the benefit of the
driver if I'm giving him or her a five
star rating if I'm giving him a three
star rating can you help me out what is
the advantage of of the driver why is
insisting us to give us star ready just
a question for you all think and answer
me getting incentives okay for reviews
perfect what about others he will paid
incentive recognition not bad not bad
that's will help the driver to present
the scenarios to Future potential
customers his Good Will good one improve
his her
credibility perfect his performance
rating H not bad good one you know what
everybody this is called your activeness
okay see doesn't matter you giving the
right answer or the wrong answer the
important things is like you come and
you answer it that is important okay
this activity is not to judging anyone's
answer this activity is like when you
hear the questions you have you have
given your input there that is important
that is the way you know uh that makes
you stand from the others one but first
of all thank you so much for the
response okay let me answer up uh my
thinking on it
see
uh now everybody I'm going to talk about
the benefits the advantage of both Sid
from the business SES as well as from
the driver side let's start with the
business SES first see or or uh the
driver side first you know what if the
driver have a very good star rating more
than 4.5 so the company has set an
algorithm like if there is 10 drivers
are waiting on the same spot so a
preferably the driver having a good star
rating will get a ride comparatively to
others this is the advantage
maybe there's an incentive all but this
is the advantage for the drive that's
why they just wants to get more rights
than you know in a day so they wanted to
improve their rating all the time so
that is the advantage of the driver
correct this is something you all knows
now come to the company side of it now
just imagine in Delhi right in Delhi
there isn't 10 drivers riding a cab
right now 10 thousands driver riding a
cab in in Delhi right now and every
driver if if it completes 10 rides in a
day so you can just compare everyone in
Excel file there will be 1,000 rows of
information will be by the end of the
day because every driver completes a 10
rights in the day thousands multiply by
10 10,000 rows of information now you
have in one Excel file and it's a mix of
information
similarly uh if I have open a one month
data so you can imagine 300,000 of rows
of data that's become a big and heavy
database for you correct now you wants
to do analysis into it your management
or maybe you wants to know how many
drivers we have having a 4.5 star or
above rating how many drivers we have
having a PO like three or less than
three how many drivers we have having a
good and average feedback they complete
the rides uh on time or before time or
how many drivers we have having a very
poor feedback and they always being late
and all correct these all information
there in the mix up way correct if those
driver if the company comes to know like
out of
1,350 drivers having a very poor ratings
so either company can fire them or
company will organize a
workshop just to improve their quality
right everybody so these are the
benefits of the company to do analysis
now the question
is who will provide these answers who
will give them the answer of these
expected questions this is is you this
is we we who will give the anal uh who
will give them answer that is called the
business analytics I am doing analysis
into it I wants to know these are my
expectations right so this is the reason
everyone I can I can give you 100%
guarantee there in every segment where
you are working in C like in the sports
in finance in business business in
government everywhere the analysis is
now a highly required things you are
from the Telecom sector or you are
working in HR department or you are
working from the Garment Industries or
you're working in service industri
doesn't matter it matter is to do
analysis you know inform to your
organization like this is uh the
overcome right and based on it the
company the organ oranization will take
decision so that is why we are here to
discuss if the data we have in Excel and
certain expectation of my company I
wanted to do analysis into it so that I
can give them the right number when we
will have the right numbers everybody we
can simply take decision on it hope this
is clear to
everybody well I think you have
mentioned both things there uh
uh it's t I'm sorry if I'm kicking
anyone's name wrong if I'm pronouncing
wrong AB okay uh admin your question
like what is difference between business
analytics and data analytics that is
your question right see business
analytics is completely based on the
datas right see business analytics is is
a word which which is completely based
on the data data is what data is a kind
of information inform based on the
activity your compan is running in the
market got it so when you have a data
then you can do analytic analytics on it
and that analytics will be your business
analytics the certain differences is
that I'm telling you when you are in the
business analytics okay when you are in
the business analytics you can have
certain things to do I'm telling you
what just look at on this screen
see can you see this one this is the
answer of your question if you have a
like if you have done the uh data
analytics that is simple I wanted to
know the answer answer of this this this
okay but it is equivalent to the
business analytics but where business
analytics can will be the descriptive
explain what has happened predictive you
know depicts what could be happened just
like you know predictions is there and
diagnos it so determines why it happened
like if we are getting continuously a
poor feedback for my uh for my company
or for for my products uh quality of the
product so at least we can diagnose like
what is the reason behind it maybe some
of the
poor uh quality in my product and then
prescriptive so this is your business
analytics so you can say the journey
starts from data and we'll get into the
business analytics of it is it clear
most welcome okay everyone and now see
that is about the business analytics now
if I'm coming to the uh you know the
need of business analytics so I have
just given an Uber example of it so you
can see understanding the changing
market and Trends just like you know you
all knows about the Nokia before 20 10
everyone was using handset of Nokia
almost 70% plus but now we saw rarely
people are using uh Nokia handset why
because of the trend is Chang people's
ENT switches from Hardware to the
software and Nokia in that moment he was
very it was very confident he he
believes to the like holding of the
customers and he loses because he he
didn't do the analysis to the market
demands and you can see the the real
example you have okay so understanding
the changing market and Trends always
that is the one part of business
analytics second one is stay ahead of
the
competition stay ahead of the
competition means there is an iPhone IOS
application there is an Android
application if anything implemented by
the iOS
application very soon you can see the
same thing or maybe in the improved
condition Android is you know presenting
to you correct similarly in in the uh
you know service Industries if any
Telecom company is creating a plan so
another one will create a similar plan
with some additional
benefits uh for the customers why
because of sustain to the market market
so that is a second part of business
analytics you have to be always
upgraded okay and you have to do
something that make your company or you
always stand in the market the third one
drive effective business decision this
is very important guys life insurance
company if there is an 10,000 customers
database you have and you are working
that organization you wanted to create a
plan of action for a different age of
people how will you create a right plan
until you don't have the right numbers
of the right number of customers age
group out of 10,000 if you know more
than
40% or more than 60% are the customers
from the adult
group maybe 20 to 60% is are the senior
citizens if you having the kind of
information then only you can create a
right plan for their customers correct
so that is important how you effectively
drive your business to do that the
business analytic is there for you okay
and now come to
the this one okay let's come to discuss
about the Excel
capabilities okay Microsoft Excel it was
was started with the version of 2003 the
oldest version and still there are you
know millions of applications running in
the market but still the one of the
userfriendly application is still
Microsoft Excel now we are running the
the version of Office
365 or MS Office
2021 the journey was started with 20 3
and we reached to Office 365 for
2021 got it so what is the Excel
capabilities why we are here to discuss
business analytic is in Excel I'm giving
you certain reason look at there it has
extensive analytics capabilities to
perform statistical analysis statistical
in the sense I need to calculate what is
the you know median of this data I want
to calculate what is the overall average
sell by the Year by the month by the
quarter I want you to know what is the
you know the mean median mode Max
minimum average sum I can easily do that
because all formulas and everything is
inbuilt into it second point it is a
tool of I'm here it is a tool of choice
to start your data analysis Antics
Journey a tool means there is an itself
Analytics tool is there and apart from
this there is an many more tools are
there that helps you to start your
analytics Journey maybe you can start
with the filter maybe you can start with
the shorting maybe you can start with
the grouping right these are the tools
you have maybe you wanted to use the
solver a scenario or goal s these are
tools for analytics we have very soon we
will discuss about it okay now the next
one is about it has the added advantage
of visibility a flat learning curve and
good reporting functionality it is
basically in short it's talking about
the
visualization we all knows if you have a
10,000 row of data rather than showing
this report in a boring way I would
suggest you convert this one into a
beautiful
column chart or tree map chart or
Sunburst chart right so the visibility
will become easy for the end user
simple the next one is it offers
intuitive analytics features to model
analyze to company's data so we have
analytics tools inbuilt addins we have
in Excel that help us to do analytics on
descriptive hypothesis an uh you know
like histogram uh like all these ones we
will discuss very soon so like you can
say overall package in one application
you are getting right it comes with an
inmemory Technologies compatibility with
Millions bytes of data which is one
million in one one sheet if you have to
store more than one million data you can
simply add a new sheet into it it
perform the necessary analysis without
being dependent on a specialized
solution right so simply enter the data
and start doing analysis that the
concept of ex that is Excel capabilities
fine Excel Vis intelligency features are
everyone this is the latest update for
you all before 2013 version these four
the advanced addins was not there if
anyone of is using still The Office 2007
and 10 might be they can't use this one
the four new
addings power pivot Power view power map
and power qu these are the advanced uh
tools is there that helps you to do
analysis in in a very easy manner just
like just imagine you are in your
organization and someone maybe your team
leader or maybe your you know the
reporting head like he has one question
like he the data is available on the
HTML
page and I wanted to create a dashboard
in Excel that has to be connected with
my HTML database html mean that website
data so how will you connect that could
be possible with power Quil we will
discuss okay so these are the four
adding that helps you to do analysis in
Microsoft Excel
easy now um I think that is here now
it's right time to start discussing
about the Excel and let's see let's face
the real problems and we'll see how this
Excel is going to help me out okay
meanwhile if anyone have any questions
regarding this analytics tools or any
question is there you can ping me and
just give me a minute let me upload the
practice file sharing the link with you
okay so uh then we can open the Excel
and start doing the things into it okay
everybody all right everybody so uh
there is you know some issues in the
back back background in the community
web page so the file is not getting
upload but not to worry about it
everyone I have requested to learner
success manager he is sharing the
practice file with you all on on your
registered email address once I'll get
the confirmation in the chat window I'll
ask you to open your email and then you
can cross check this one but right now
just be here let me show you what data I
have shared to you all and uh and how we
will start working into it hey everyone
look at on my screen I'm going to open
the that folder guys this is the data uh
the folder I have shared to you all once
you get it you will open see you don't
need to prepare anything okay already I
have prepared the sample database for
you with a problem statement correct so
you just need to open the file the file
which I will say please open this one
right so you can just open it and we
will start working into it right so I'm
going to start with this formatting
condition this is a file name all right
I just open I want to show you like what
exactly keeping inside of the database
okay I will start my journey with a data
cleansing activity but before this let
me give you a
smart interface of this application
because might be in this team maybe if
if anyone is there who are not familiar
with this applications will have the
idea okay everyone look at them
Microsoft Excel is a combination of few
things one is called the workbook second
one is called the worksheet third one is
called the column fourth one is called
the row and a cell right so just look at
on the screen I'm giving you some idea
look at here everyone if you just look
at to the top of this area this one this
is the area we called it a quick access
toolbar you can quickly access your own
favorite tools so you know you can you
you not need to go and and click on it
all the time you can just directly click
and it will get done it's called the
quick access toolbar now this is the
area is called a ribbon tab please you
can note it down somewhere if you wish
uh because when you will share your
screen and I'm asking to you sir please
go to the ribbon tab go to the ribbon
tab at least you should have an idea
where the ribbon tab is so this is your
Ribbon tab every tab has their own
features just like right now I am into
the Home tab okay and this these are the
options available inside the Home tab
similarly we have insert draw page
layout formulas data review and all
correct and and you know what uh there
is one more option is there is called a
file this one so if you just click to
the file you will get get some
additional features into it just like
you know save save as uh print export
additional settings if it is required so
you can click over there now let me talk
about let me say just this is your
column okay this is your column this is
your row right in a horizontal line uh a
row a vertical line a column and
whatever coming in where both are
getting intersect is called a cell right
so simple a vertical line is a column a
horizontal line is your row and both are
getting intersect at a point is called a
cell if you save your Excel file so that
will save as an workbook and worksheet
means this is the one right now we are
on the sheet right so if you will click
on she shift plus f11 a new sheet will
get added right so that is the
introduction of your uh this Excel one
okay and right now the uh extension name
of this one is called
xlsx office
365. okay
so V what is a workbook a workbook
whatever the Excel file you
save Excel file you sa that is called a
workbook clear any Excel file if you saw
so you can treat that one as an Excel
workbook or in short you can see
combination of multiple sheet is called
a workbook VJ clear okay so it's
uh which version of excel we need to use
Hey listen to me everybody
I am not saying it is important to use
the Office 365 the latest one you guys
can use any version okay but yes for the
new version with the new version some
new features come across got it so that
is my duty to let you know about it like
uh
these are the new
features but any version of excel you
can use but try not to use the uh ACC
copy of this application which is called
the WPS office right try not to use the
online Excel one because online Excel
has some less feature versus the offline
one and if you wants to check your
version everybody so you can click to
the file you can come to this account
option and here you can see your uh you
know your versions right now I'm using
Office 365 so any version like if you're
using I am completely okay with this
clear yeah next any anyone uh anyone
have any questions please feel free to
ask
me okay
so that's
great let me right click on it and I'm
just going to Rel it okay
everyone so now I'm coming back to my
database and as I'll get the
confirmation from the learner success
manager like is forwarded to uh the file
to you all right well tanusha Office 365

write your question in the chat below
I'll answer after this okay let me start
at least let's start with the important
instructions interv okay so everyone
just look at that um important point to
remember if you working start working in
Microsoft Excel see I'm not going to
cover about this uh you know bold italic
underline cut copy paste and alignment
center left I know everyone is familiar
with this but this is important this is
really really important this is the one
which I have just made it in this the
rectangular shape of it uh basically if
you will uh you know uh if you will
click here this one so this one helps
you to turn your data into a right
format of it right format I mean to just
look at there it's an order dat column I
select it listen to me properly then
I'll give you proper time to do that
after me I select order date but this
one not look like order date it is
coming like a number so if you have the
data like this you can't do analysis
into it because the data is not coming
in a proper way and that's what I call
the data cleansing activity just look at
there not to worry
select
click a short dat when I click on it
it's done it's so simple click and
converted right just wait now I just
converted this
one maybe my question is like 09 and 11
2015 I need to see uh rather than 11 can
I get that November n o not to worry do
after converting this one into a date
right click on it and come to this

click it is a more option window open it
is called a more option okay you have
see you have choosen one date and now
you have many date format over here

clicked on okay and see the same date is
now formatted as an DD mmm and Y okay so
right click for my Excel and I would
like to tell you one more thing guys in

change how to apply the uh date format
how to apply the currencies format in
Excel uh
now right click on it listen to me both
of you right click on it selected data
format cell and I guarantee to you there

I'm I'm going to the right side hey
everybody if you will press control Plus
semicolon this is a sign answer me what
is coming in your Excel file press
control plus semicolon on any
cell okay come on everybody just answer
me ASA very good it's not a date only it
is a current date perfect now try one
more it's like Control Plus shift plus
semicolon answer me okay that's great so
that gives you a current system
time got it so if you are in the
production department or uh you know
where you wanted to update today's date
and today's time the current time you
can use the shortcut key like this
okay try one more just type is equal to
T o d a y today bracket open and close
and
enter is equal to
today bracket open and
close an absolutely right answer that
formula helps you to
current date okay try one more everybody
is equal to
listen to me now is equal to now bracket
open and
close it's a date and time and you know
what a good news is that this is if it
is coming like Hash Hash Hash so you
don't have to worry about it look at on
my screen I just write is equal to now
and now open bracket and close and it's
coming like Hash Hash Hash it just not
mean that I have given the wrong answer
okay you just come to this see I'm
taking my mouse over here between t
column and U column there's a border
line and I just expanded see I'm I'm
able to see this one okay so hey
everybody uh 27th of May
2023 9:54 morning is the right current
date and current time a good news is
that everybody look now it is coming
9:55
and if you you know what this formula
helps you to update your date and time
isn't really good one if you open this
file tomorrow the date will get changed
automatically in the time too why don't
you just do double click somewhere and
hit enter and let me know is your date
and time is also getting
changed perfect one and now last but not
the least
see
[Music]
um
okay now listen H that's
okay like what I what should I call you
it's like RJ r m v wasu should I
pronounce
youu ram ram listen you are using the
MacBook now just do one thing see if it
is coming only showing you the date
right click on it and go to the format
cell right and in this custom you have
to see is it DD mm and y y along with HH
mm and SS is there or not so sometime if
it is not there so it is only showing
you the current date and time okay now
one more everybody let's say if see I
have write the formula is equal to n o w
Now Now function brings me what current
date and current time however if I need
to know I need to get only a current
time listen to me a current time that
needs to be get updated all the time so
I'm telling you everyone in Excel we do
not have any direct formula for it a
current time that has to change
automatically okay so I got an idea
see this now function brings me what the
Now function brings me current date and
current time perfect then I put
minus minus and I'm going to just
substract what today's date so guys tell
me if there is a date and time minus
date what
left think about it and that will be
only time look when I hit enter if it is
coming listen to me complete
if it is coming as in decimals not to
worry click here and change the format
as in time try and let me
know everyone has to try and and anyone
facing any issues I would re just
request you all I said just type this
formula webo look is equal to now
bracket open close minus today bracket
open close okay so once you hit enter
rabo it will come into a decimals not to
worry select it again and here change it
into a time
format okay VI if it is coming hash
simply look at on my screen you can
expand the column ver like this okay
just expand the column B and I'm sure
you will get your
answer okay everybody now see these are
the informations for you to be handy
with Microsoft Excel but now let's talk
about some real life challenges see I
believe that if I want to do analysis in
Microsoft Excel at least I should have
the right data if I do not have the
right and formatted data I cannot get
the right numbers into it just look at
this one someone has prepared the report
like this monthly sales report for the
year 2020 21 it there is an tier one to
tier 14 and this is the data for genan
fa March April May June see I have
selected till this one I found one very
problematic things in this table and
that is that is a blank sale there is a
there are so many blank sales over here
now I cannot forward this report to my
upper management why because that looks
not good and even if I'm trying to
convert this one into pivot table I'll
get some blank blank blank answer that
is even not good for me I need to fill
that zero inside all the blank c that's
my question I need to fill
zero whever the blank cell is so you
know what
everyone um you have two choice either
be hardworking guy and start doing it
manually or be smart working and but
just press control plus HED I repeat
everyone it is a shortcut key for
replace one control+ HED or if you're
not able to do that so you can see
inside the Home tab here is the option
is called find and select and this is
the replace when I'm come to this
replace one and it says find what find
what what do you want to find and I'm
like I want to find a blank and blank
can not express blank is just a blank so
leave this one as it is and come to this
replace with the next one and just type
there zero and wherever you click
obviously I want you to replace it all
instantly so I will click and my
replacement is done try
everybody once again
okay simple select the data as I have
selected but don't select this total
okay and now I'm going to click on this
find and select and choose this option
is called replace or see me look at
there the shortcut key is control+ H if
you just click on it this window
appeared find what leave it as it is
because I need to find the blank replace
with just type zero and click on replace
all replacement will get
done try now
if anyone is here who is still getting
any challenge not completing so you can
feel free to ask me okay and now listen
everybody this one is still not yet
completed I need to get the total by
tier one I need to get the total by
month Jan Fab March and all I know there
is a Formula you all know about sum sum
is a Formula universally we use to get
the total got it but you know what I
have something else for you guys just do
one thing select it
all and press alt ALT key plus is equal
to and tell me what happened with your
table alt plus is equal to okay I'm not
doing I just wanted to you try and let
me know alt plus is equal to I've just
given written in the the chat window how
is this shortcut key is it helpful
everybody yes you can share your
experience as well okay just keepy these
shortcut keys I'll give you because I
told you guys I love to work in
Microsoft Exel with the shortcut keys
got it so you can select it all and
press alt is equal to any job is done if
someone is using the MacBook I will STI
command plus is equal to you can try
hopefully
you get that one okay yeah um
all plus is equal to guys it is a
shortcut key for auto
Su okay would you like to see one more
problem statement
everyone uh I hope uh I'm not going fast
the pce is okay for
all please responds me the pace is okay
for all of you
guys uh the next problem everyone as we
are here to do analytics I wanted to uh
show you some problem statement into it
just look at this one hey everybody here
as I'm from India so I'm using the
Indian territories database so here
someone has prepared the report like
this and shared to me when I open this
one I found oh my gosh there is a
problem with this table these are the
blank sales over there these are the
blank Sals guys just response me what do
you think what should be there in the
blank sale just answer me other state no
the same state has to be there no see
like as an as in uh you know the area
head just think now like see this is
Delhi it means these numbers also belong
to the same state but that someone has
prepared this report to me and share to
me like he prepared and share to me and
I found this one and I'm like oh my gosh
the he left the blank Sals over here now
I need to merge Del inside all right Hey
Hey Hey listen to me control D very good
but I wanted to tell you guys you know I
know you all know something here like
see if I ask you come on fill the Del
inside your answer will be like aim you
can hold it from the corner drag it step
number one contrl zed step number two
select it press contrl D step number
three contrl Zed
copy and
taste correct but guys this is a small
data no doubt but just imagine if you
have a data having a 55 states name that
you have to fulfill or maybe 50 states
name don't you think it's it is a very
time taken process to start copying and
paste because you cannot copy entirely
and paste it why because certain you
know breakages there like you know I
have to past Mumbai here and I have to
past Kolkata and all am I right so copy
paste dragging drop that will take a lot
of time and efforts so here I am to help
you out to do this task in one click let
me try
the first thing is select your table
step number one select your table step
number two press contrl g g for go
to step number one select your table
step number two press control g g for go
to and then click here hey everybody
click on special when you click on it
and what do you have to select it's a
blanks and just click okay please reach
to this place and confirm to
me now I'll show you the next part of
it wow thank you so much for this one uh
it's
uh what should I call you
like prasan uh it's like gari pran is it
correct okay so you you people mention
they're done and look everyone if you
just observe this one so entirely sales
are coming with blank sales selected
that is why I did this activity doesn't
matter the data is small or it's a
really big one okay all the blank sales
get selected keep this one as it is and
press is equal to when you press is
equal to it will comes to the top of the
selected cell press is equal to that
will comes to the top of of the selected
cell and just click on this Del once you
select the Del the previous one the
previous one and then Control Plus enter
and your job is done everybody
try can I repeat I said once you get
this one selected press is equal to
select
Del and Control Plus enter these are the
shortcuts just remember everyone that's
going to help you a lot from the
beginning SN okay look at on the screen
I said select the
table step number one control G step
number
two
spal step number
three blanks step number four okay step
number five correct and once you reach
to this place do not click any where
just press is equal to once you press it
will be open like like the is equal sign
comes to the top of the cell select Deli
and press control enter okay try and let
me
know which functions we go to control G
control it's a go to control g means go
to and then click on
spal okay m
okay one more everyone a problem
statement with Microsoft Excel I would
like to tell you one thing guys if you
wants to write any numbers along with
you know leading with the zero not along
with the leading with zero so in Excel
it is problematic see if you write zero
before the numbers and you hit enter the
zero got managed that's why it's a data
cleansing because you must have to be
familiar with all these options okay so
look when you write 0 0 0 and just time
to any numbers over there zero is gone
it's not coming so what we do there is
two ways to do that the first one is see
with number it is in not possible to
show zero correct so what else you can
you can just come up
here here and first make it as in text
the cell you can make it as in text
correct and then start writing 00 0 and
this one enter hit and that starts
coming okay that starts coming like this
so this is what is the first step what
will you do click
here come to the text this one convert
your uh cell into a text format and then
if you write any number along with zero
then it will start coming the second way
is the shortcut way is if you just put a
single
comma single inverted
Comma just put it there and directly
start writing this way enter h and I I'm
sure you will see your number starts
coming with zero try and answer
me okay your question is like moit what
we are doing with Control G I wanted to
fill blanks with the previous name so my
question is here what is the way to
select all the blank sale
instantly what is the way in Excel to
select all the blank cells
instantly this is the way Control G
spatial blanks and okay so that I can
fill the desired things into
it okay just try everyone and and please
let me know side by side huh okay the
error it is not an error it is just a
symbol an instruction okay uh adwin
instructions means see H when I put that
apostrophe sign or the single iMed comma
so I'm trying to you know uh I'm trying
to uh sing to excel that convert this
number into a
text right and 9876 is just a number for
me but I'm forcefully making this one as
in text so it is not error it is just
instruction from Excel side sir are you
sure about it just look when I click it
say number is stored as a text it is
giving you information are you sure
about it maybe you wanted to convert
this one into a number but I would say
don't click here because if you do that
now again zero will get vanished so in
that case what we do we just ignore the
error of it is it
clear okay rajes are you talking about
this
one this one is that your question so
you can select it all press contrl G
come to
special click on blanks and click on
okay so once you click okay so all blank
sales will get selected and then press
is equal to select the previous daily
and press control enter okay
rajes okay so uh now everyone let's jump
in and let's talk about the statistical
analysis first you can come to the next
sheet of it everyone and from here
onwards I'm going to start discussing
about the formulas okay in Excel if you
are here you have to be very good with
with the formulas okay
so uh I will request you all look at on
my screen the second sheet is called
statistical analysis part one I'll
explain you formula and side by side
I'll give you the exercise two for a
homeor you want it to really improve
your efficiency in this application do
as much as assignment you can do correct
so just look at on the screen everyone
it's a
data
data having the columns like date sales
representative products units price sell
City region and date okay kindly Zoom
your
screen uh
okay is
it okay everyone do I need to vij do I
need to increase more is it okay come on
everybody because this is very good you
can just let me know uh if you're facing
any challenges there that's great for me
okay now listen everyone see I have a
date date and uh I have a sales
representative now who is the sales
representative we I have a product units
price sale City region name and date
that is my data and
I have I'm here not with the small
database for you because uh when you
have a big data so calculation become
automatically very interesting if you
press control and down arrow so that
show you that total number of rows we
have is total number of row entered row
we have is or 10,000 And1 it means it is
nothing but a 10,000 plus row of data
how am I jumping between it easily
because of using control down arrow key
control up Arrow key control right
control left okay so Control Plus arrows
in your keyboard is just like a exelator
and control and shift if you have added
control shift down control shift right
and see got selected easily so whenever
you have your hand ling a big data the
two shortcut keys is always going to
help you a lot just like control arrows
Control Plus shift plus arrow this just
for those people who maybe doesn't have
this doesn't know about the shortcut key
they're using still they're using the
scroll bar so I would say rather than
using the scroll bar start with control
down control up or control shift down to
select
for it okay so I have a 10,000 database
and I have certain
requirements just like my first question
everyone requesting look on my screen
you can try after me
okay how will you write a formula in
Excel I know it is a very basic question
everyone knows start with is equal to
correct I saw people still they're
writing the formula in this way s u m
bracket open
manually okay I deleted V look up v l o
o k u
p p a bracket open manually why no
change this habit from today onwards
press is equal to if you have to write
some s u m and then press a Tab Key you
have to press okay make this habit from
today onwards any formula whatever the
formula I'm going to teach you in this
entire duration of the
class equals to s m and tab equals to V
lookup a tab so that will save your time
when your formula comes completely open
with the brackets okay or open
parenthesis I just write there sum and
now I need to select sum of what column
there is the one now if I'm start
selecting my data like this way you can
understand a 10,000 plus
row that will take a lot of time I will
say control shift and down arrow that's
instantly got selected so now when I hit
enter I'm getting the total cell is
there
one2 625 that is the total cell hold on
I'm going to ask you one thing everyone
see it is a 10,000
one row of data but it is not I'm not
saying that I'm not going to add more
data into it in
future yes obviously I will add so if I
will added a new data in this table just
like this one this one and this one and
this one to what do you think guys will
these four numbers automatically to be
added in my total cell
calculation is these four numbers to be
added there a newly entered
data is being
added come on everyone give me your
response here and yes and absolutely
right and I know the uh you know like
U yes so uh it is it is not to be added
there reason because you know the range
I have specified till 10,000 and row
what else I can do I can come up here
and uh I can increase the row number
simple if I will increase a row number
10,1 I'm going to say
10,50 and I hit enter now that number is
getting increased in future if I'm
dumping more data into it then again I
have to do the same same thing but that
is not a good sign
of of an a good excelence right you
should make this one completely Dynamic
to make this one Dynamic I will say
everyone write
some come to the column
F and click here see where my mouse I
click here so rather than specifying the
range I have just selected the entire
column f
okay so once you select it all you hit
enter so the benefit is like 6625 now
look the benefit is like if I'm going to
add one number one number here anywhere
you will see hard one get changed so
this is called the dynamic work so
always try to make your table Dynamic
CFI will in future I will just copy and
paste more data into it my automation
will get
done automatically cared so that is the
way I can get the total cell similarly
if I need to know what is the average
cell
overall for average cell you know
everyone the mathematical rule is total
sales divided by the number of
total so how will you uh do that don't
use the formula as sorry don't use that
mathematical calculation manually
calculation you can use the formula
itself is called average average of what
average of column F and I hit enter now
we have the average of it but guys
important point is it is coming 1, 122.
6625 four decimal digits how can I
reduce this one here look at there the
shortcut key everyone this is for those
who are not familiar with this so I'm
just going to decrease the decimals once
and twice and I'm keeping for two
decimals digit that is called the
average cell similarly if I need to know
what is the maximum cell means the
largest number of cell we have a formula
is called a Max I'm going to select it
column F and I hit enter
1275 is the maximum sell got it so uh at
least try this one along with the
minimum cell two and answer me everyone
go
ahead repeat the average okay Sim me
just look at there there's a formula
itself called
average
okay and select the column enter
simple okay for
maximum uh you can use a formula is
called a Max
unable to find the data uh okay
appreciate everybody those who have done
with this uh one like you
know the 100 so 100 is an absolutely
right
answer perfect one so everyone this is
the basic formulas okay the basic
statistical formulas is required just
like if you want to calculate the mean
you have uh you know the median here
fine and if you wanted to calculate the
mode so there is the uh formula for it
that's called the m o That's mode fine
so that you can use accordingly but now
it is time to discuss about it the next
and one step further calculations hey
everyone
now um I wanted to calculate the total
cell listen it properly and then try
after me okay I want to calculate the uh
total cell total cell based on criteria
based on a condition with me I'm going
to explain a lot of formulas to you all
everybody so try not to memorize any
formula because if you do that maybe you
will not use these formulas for the long
time right try to understand the
arguments the arguments if you can if
you can understand or if you understand
the arguments you can easily find out
like why it is giving me error so
everyone focus on the arguments rather
than memorizing this one okay just
coming to this
one I need to
know what is the total cell total cell
based on North only East only West only
and South only so when the condition
comes to you I need to get the total
overall I can use some but if there is a
condition it can be one it can be more
than one fine so uh when you wanted to
get the total based on some certain
conditions given so I will say everyone
you can try some if listen to me some if
but some if can can be used only for one
condition so it's better to learn this
one that can helps you to understand so
that can helps you to bring the total
based on not only one condition but
based on multiple conditions too so
rather than using some if I will say
everyone learn some ifs this one formula
will perform on both conditions either
one more than one let me show you how
and I told you everyone when you write
this formula sum
ifs okay you just need to focus on the
arguments part of it just look at the
first argument the one which is being
highlighted in a black color it means it
is an active
arguments if I put comma second one is
active if I put comma the third one is
active if I put comma a fourth one is
active you can see there is an you know
the number of arguments I can use with
Microsoft with the some ifs function Su
ifx function brings you the total based
on
256 condition of the
criteria okay so let me show you how so
just always go with the flow of the
formula you're never ever going to get
the wrong numbers it says sumary
the definition
is tell
me which range you wanted to get sum
ultimately so obviously I'm looking for
the total of column F that is my sum
range simply I Define this one so I
repeat the definition of sum range is
select the range which you wanted to get
total ultimately then I put comma
and look at the second argument and that
says criteria range one means your
criteria is what I'm looking for the
total of North
only okay I'm looking for the nor only
total so you have to select the range
first as for the argument look you have
to select the range in which the north
exist in which your criter area exists
so when I select this column Ed and I
put comma it says okay now give me the
criteria a criteria can be defined in
two way of it if you wants to write
North you just have to put double comma
and you can write North double comma
close you will hit enter you will get
your answer this is the total from North
Region
okay but the problem is like if I'm
dragging it down it is coming the same
number repeated why because I have
mentioned North
manually so if you want that answer has
to be rotated I would say criteria don't
write and but just select the cell cell
is k6 when I select it and I close my
bracket and I I hit enter and look
everyone when I drag it down k6 become
K7 K8 K9 and my answer is getting
changed if you're not believing this is
correct or not I can prove to you some
sum of all these
numbers all these
numbers is equal to sorry the head enter
and see this number and the total is now
absolutely matching it means we have we
made the right calculations over here
okay everybody try your first Formula
some
ifs well there is no need to uh see
maybe uh it's like money
kandra pru okay uh no need to copy and
paste the result into it might be you
are good with this formula average and
some ifs and all but I think there are
many more people
who wants to use this one for the first
time correct there is no need it's good
you done it very good for me uh but not
required
okay okay rajes are you you're unable to
find the statistical analysis bar means
the sheet one uh did you have downloaded
the zip folder uh rajes answer
me okay and uh in that folder have you
opened this file the name is called uh
uh this one this sheet have you I mean
that workbook have you opened this one
you have opened this very good and can
you uh answer me where my mouse moving
is statistical analysis part one is is
not there because I have shared the same
data with everyone so then start doing
it now you can use a scroll bar maybe
here and there so you will see then why
you saying like unable to find the
statistical analysis part one this is
there now similar uh no index uh match
function will not work here uh admin
because indexing functions helps you to
bring the exact
information right but with the help of
uh you know sum and index function then
it will bring you the total of it
because here we are trying to get the
total we not trying to fet the right
numbers the only numbers so ashin you
tell me to get the total rather than sum
just forget it about the sum what do you
think uh how will you get the total of a
range without sum see I don't know any
formula here right but if I need to get
the total of specifically for North so
either I can do one thing I will apply
the filter North select it then again
get the sum of it and I will write it
manually that I can
use if you want to multiply I'm telling
you my friend see if you wants to
substract so substract will never
happens based on the Range look for
example if there three four five and six
is there and there is an you know like 2
3 5 1 and if I need to get the substract
substract means I need to compare each
in every single sale you cannot say like
I need to get the total minus this one
if this is required again you have to
use the same formula like sum sum of
this minus sum sum of This Means first
get the total minus then get the total
and then give me the answer so now
that's coming seven are you getting my
point so sub sub ract multiply and
dividation is always happens row by row
row by row context but not with the you
know the
range okay perfect one everyone and now
comes to get the average price so
similarly when you have the total when
you want to get the total but there is
uh the condition is there so you tried
some ifs similarly you can try average
ifs for to get the average
based on the condition average range
again I need to know the average of cell
column
F comma then it says give me the
criteria range exactly the same as you
learn the this one range means range
comma criteria means criteria and I
close my bracket and I hit enter and
look if it is coming in
a uh with more Des decimal digits I will
say just go ahead and decrease the
decimals of it and then drag it down and
this will be your answer try this one to
everybody average ifs function okay
might be I have applied the average
price on sell it has to be on a price
correct not to worry select the column e
everyone rather than f
I will say one simple thing here
everyone like you
know um just keep doing it and once
you're done you can ping me because this
is the only way I can know is it done or
not right the shortcut key for dragging
the formula is shift with down arrow key
and then press control D for okay
okay all right everyone I wanted to tell
you one more uh statement here let me
see uh let me check and uh let me show
you not the check okay guys here is a
city I have given Ranchi trendum my and
all let me uh I think Ranchi I have
written one more time okay no worries
myour pun nagur and all I need to know
what is the total sale in all these
cities if I'm giving you this clask I'm
sure you're going to do that one very
very easy but I'm just going to add few
more things into it everyone just look
at here I have some sales representative
just like uh travel Jones I just copy
its
name and I'm going to uh paste it here
what is that mean I need to know what is
the total sell made or done by Mr TR
Jones in these cities that's the
question it means now I have two
conditions and that's why I'm I'm I'm
giving you the training on the Su ifs
function some ifs function is capable to
apply conditions more than one criteria
on it just look how I'm going to start
it's like some ifs I'm sure you know why
am I using this some range ultimately
what I'm looking for is total cell guys
if you are are facing difficulties to
move this scroll bar I would like to
tell you one more easiest way look at
the column f look at the column H sorry
City for City it's G and for sales
representative is B column B just
remember this one for sale f for City G
and for sales representative is B come
back to this one if if you are facing
difficulty to scroll it all the time
left to right I will say you just write
F to F it's being selected okay but you
want you can do you you can just go and
select it manually I don't mind at all
okay and I put comma then it says
um criteria range tell me the criteria
range of it so if it is Ri so obviously
I would select I have to select the
column G first that is my criteria area
range and then I will select this Raji
why because I me I'm dragging it down I
need that has to be rotated okay then I
put again comma why because I have one
more condition which is Mr Traver Jones
and as for the Mantra of some ifs
function first select the range and then
criteria so Mr Traver Jones all the Cs
representative names available inside
the
column is B2 B then I select it and I
click on Mr travel Jones When I close my
bracket because my criteria has been
fulfilled now when I hit enter and I'm
getting zero what does it mean it means
Mr Traver Jones not make a single sale
in drai okay so let's suppose if I'm
going to write here uh let's say Goa
uh oh
trendum wow Mr Traver Jones territory is
something else I think so if I'm going
to cross check one
second Mr travor travor Jones it's like
travor so Mr Traver territory is Pune
basically okay so uh not worry let me
change this question don't worry guys I
have many more questions for you I'm
going to write Sunday when I hit enter
and I wants to know like uh in the city
uh like rachi what is the total sales
done on the day Sunday Sunday is
available in the colum I okay so let me
show you Sunday is in the column I so
let me start with the formula again some
ifs ultimately I need to get the total
of column F comma criteria range will be
G in that G I need to see the rachi
comma and then criteria range number two
if it is about the Sunday I will say
select the column I because this is the
column where all your Sunday Monday
Tuesday and everything is there then I
put comma and select the criteria simple
Mantra remember everybody range first
and then criteria I'm going to close my
bracket and I hit enter 62,200
okay but the problem is when I drag it
down everybody uhoh I'm getting Z 0
Zer question is like why it is coming
zero so when the zero comes it does not
mean that you mention a wrong formula
just look at there when I do double
click here just observe anything is
wrong in this formula observe and answer
me anything is anything wrong in this
formula well Deepa look at there again
now tell me what is wrong in this
formula everything is correct except one
guys
Focus exactly you know what everyone as
I am moving down I'm moving down see
that all total has to be based on the
day Monday but the problem is like this
is not problem it is a default property
of Microsoft Excel when you will scroll
it down now all your cell address starts
moving so I don't want to this one allow
to get moved what to do you can fix this
one but how with the shortcut keys is
called
F4 F four and look how I'm going to uh
delete this uh one and when I select
this one you just need to press F4 key
F4 and see if your F4 is not
working if not working please hold on
your FN key and then press F4 and just
hit enter and let me double click double
click and see we have a perfect results
are here okay and now you know what this
entire numbers will will get change if
you just write the name it's like Friday
see the entire report is getting updated
that's the benefit try now everyone
formula is open here on my screen okay
okay come on everybody
CH try and if anyone is there who wants
me to repeat this please let me know
okay okay
Vijay perfect look at on the screen
hopefully the question is clear to you
vij uh Deepa F key is not working means
see sometime now a few of the laptop
laptop where the FN key is already
enabled you don't need to uh keep it on
uh hold the FN key okay you can directly
press
F4 and if your F4 is not working FN key
is not working then DEA I would simply
advised to you put the manual dollar
sign okay so VI look at on the screen I
said uh is start with the sum
ifs it says sum range sum range means
which range you wanted to get sum okay V
so I'm going to select the column F
comma then now the total will be based
on what RI Ranchi is what Ranchi is my
city so select the range where all the
city exist comma
and select the rachi then I put comma
then it says okay ri's total you are
looking for on the day Friday Friday
Sunday Monday belongs to which column I
this column I comma and the criteria is
this so once you select it you have to
keep
it you know press
F4 that comes into dollar sign close the
bracket okay V enter hit and you will
have your answer now try and let me know
I can see that more than 48 people are
here but unfortunately I'm getting less
responses there will be great if you can
let me know then I can give you a
question here try and answer me
everybody just do analysis and answer
but at least first complete this one
then I'll give you a
question okay uh
well your question is like uh what is
there are more CR do we have all those
in a separate column or row depends on
you can keep it on the different
separate columns up to you because if
you wanted to make it Dynamic you must
have to keep this one somewhere separate
so that like you will make changes over
there and the result will get change
automatically into the table right and
uh F4 key I would say uh look at on the
screen I I can show you directly here
like see so when I select this one I'm
going to open the virtual keyboard for
you just look at on the screen this uh
look everyone when you click on this F
uh P4 that this cell here is the FN key
in your keyboard okay you can hold down
hold down and press F4 and I'm not
saying this is compulsory to keep it
hold FN key because some of the keyboard
is already enabled this F4 one okay we
just click
and see in my fnki it is it has to be
you know like uh hold so this is the way
you can apply the dollar sign
simple and I'm sure now it is clear to
you okay everyone I have a very small
question for you all you can see
everyone we have a total quantity sold
see sales we have calculated I wanted to
ask you all tell me the quantity sold
quantity means the column D that is
units okay don't be confused this one
units I am looking for but look at here
let me complete my question first okay
complete this question so what is my
question is tell me the quantity sold
based on all these cities
after October 10
2013 I repeat
tell me what is the number of quantity
we sold in the city of Ranchi tendam my
Pune and
all but only those sell after October 10
2013 hope you get my question
everyone well you have to select the
date columns without it you can't get
the right number that's what is the
point P one obviously like see uh this
question belongs to date criteria so you
need to select the column
date obviously based on it I wanted to
know the quantity sold in
cities so everybody uh are you still
working on or should I answer this
one okay so jagi giving me one
125 okay and it is coming zero
Focus J okay that's okay J just wait uh
maybe I don't remember the numbers but
yes let me cross Che okay so uh I need
attention everyone here again I'm I'm
going to use the same uh concept of it
the column of date having a a
column quantity is coming on D column
city is coming on G column so I'm not
coming back to to sh select it manually
right so I will keep here and I'll just
write the formula directly and I I wish
you should learn this concept
okay I'm going to start with this like
some ifs it says some range so units D
to D column simple some ultimately I
need to this one comma a criteria range
Ranchi Ranchi is what a City so you
can't select the city first you have to
define the range where all the city
exist comma and now you can select the
Ranchi that is a criteria so simple guys
okay now put comma and it's like uh next
criteria that belongs to the date which
is October 10 2013 after so that belongs
to the column
a column A but I have to say not the
entire date I have to say only that
happens after October 10 2013 so after
you have to
explain with uh Express with greater
than symbol greater than means after
that is an operator greater than means
after less than means before so greater
than I'm going to say 10 10
2013 Double quotes
close hey everyone if you are making
this mistake to select the cell it's
wrong okay it has a word like after
after is an alphabet so this one is
completely a text please write the date
like this enter hit and yes J this well
done
12:05 double click that's my
numbers okay please copy the same now
well huh yeah obviously like see you
know if you just hit enter and you just
come to the drop down like see the
corner of it when it get turned into
this plus symbol just do double click on
it okay so that will get drag and draw
this is a shortcut
way okay all right
everyone okay that's great uh it is
coming zero so please check the formula
I just copy it and past it in the chat
window I will say uh you can uh check
this one okay and I'm sure you will get
that idea if not I'll help you out
confirmations here everyone so in this p
in this sheet we discuss about some
basic formula just like sum it is a Max
minan and the average of it and uh if
you have to get the same thing the total
Max minimum and average based on uh the
condition and the criteria I would say
simply use this formula it's called sum
ifs and for average it is like average
ifs for the latest version like if you
start using the office 16 so you have a
good news is that Max ifs function is
also there for you the same way as you
are using suip and average ifs there
fine so in this phas this is what we
have covered hopefully this has been
clear to you all and if you just come to
this one guys this is your homework okay
uh I will say this is your homework
complete this assignment when you come
to like last mean the next day so if you
have any queries any questions for me so
you can at least ask me okay so I have
given two sheet as an homework for you
all right so complete it and they all
questions will be based on your sum ifs
and sum functions okay so read the
questions carefully and get the numbers
here fine so the two sheets is for the
homeworks for you all everyone right and
now come to the statistics analysis part
number two now in this phase I will
discuss on the counting part of it
okay well I'm not sure but are you I
think you're not focusing on my formula
moit after a to a column I put a comma
and why you are specifying range
again why a to way you are defining
greater than 10 o October 2013 which you
are writing there
manually manually means what whenever
you write anything manually Excel says
You must have to write this one in
between double inverted comma and that
is incorrect in your formula now moving
forward everybody and now in this
statistical part number
two I will discuss about the counting
you know what if see getting sum getting
average is one pce but getting count of
it is is another phase of it I mean to
say just look at there I have a column A
having month B having sales
representative C having type of account
and D having amount correct so
um if my boss says aim tell
me what is the total amount if my bosses
tell me the total amount or total
collection so I will go ahead with the
sum and I will select the column D and I
enter hit that is coming
14,22 is the total collection but if my
boss says aim tell me the number of
collection we receive today number of
collection means is not asking me to get
the total is asking me to count the
number of payment like one like two like
three like four so manually don't count
it you can use this formula that is
called a the count function so uh when I
select it and I hit enter so I can
simply answer like sir if you uh like
the
total total collection is 14,000 and
122 and number of collections we have is
somewhere like 24 collections we do have
and look if I will increase one more and
see the total is change as well as
accounting is Chang now just imagine the
third situation is that rather than
collection I wanted to know that know
there is a column B where Mr sales
representatives names are there a sales
representative that belongs to my
company I wanted to to I wanted to know
like what is the number of times uh
their sales representative names are
entered means that entry I wanted to
count
overall so if I'm using the formula
called count and I select it all and I
hit enter and I'm getting zero do you
know why I'm telling the reason is like
for example here I have mentioned one 2
three then some
alphabets again few numbers and again
few alphabets
now if I will use a formula called count
so count is a function that only counts
what and only counts number you can see
that answer is coming seven seven means
it is only count what number so if you
wants to count
Alpha numbers everything then rather
than using count function you should use
the formula is called count a
if you choose this one select it all
bracket close enter so now that's coming
40
so
count a
formula we use to count all Alpha all
numbers correct so it means if I need to
count the number of entries of sales
representative so rather than using
count I would go ahead with the count a
function now if I select it all and
close my bracket and that's coming
27 and you know what 27 is the wrong
answer why because I have selected the
entire column entire column means it's
including the heading too heading is
also an alphabet right so I don't want
to consider this one so I can just write
minus one outside of it and then I can
see a total number of entries we have is
26 for sales
representative now last but not the
least and that is about if you will use
this formula every that is called count
blank and if you select this entire
table like this close the bracket enter
hit so that's coming to count blank is a
Formula which only counts the cell
having a blank values a blank like that
is completely black okay everyone
completed and match the numbers as
mine the formula which I have used I
have just written in front of it so you
can easily copy it
now is it hopefully okay for you
V all right every one hopefully this is
done everybody so count functions count
a function and count blank functions
okay differences we you now uh no but
just imagine if you got a situation like
where you know uh know the that formula
to to be used here to count the numbers
if you have to uh use a formula to count
the numbers you know the formula is
called count
now uh the second formula is we just
discuss here and that is about the count
a function that helps you
to tell you that uh Alpha and numbers
both but just imagine if I need to know
out of this table if I need to count
only the alphabets I don't want to count
the numbers so we do not have any
formula for it but there is a kind of
thing you can do that is like count a
function you can use the count a
function will count Alpha and numbers
both then minus I will use the count
function so uh if you select it also
count function you know it only counts
what it's an number Alpha numbers minus
numbers what left that is the alphabets
only so if ever it is required everybody
just remember you can use this formula
that is called count a minus count that
only counts what only counts the
alphabet quickly noted down this
one well I said if I need to count only
the alphabets so I can use the formula
is called count a select the range so
this one counts alphine numbers both
minus I will use count function select
the same range so count function will
only counts what Alpha sorry only the
numbers so alpha numeric minus numbers
if you do so what left that is only the
alphabets look I'm going to write any
alphabet here or here it is coming nine
that is only the alphabets this formula
is open here on my scin keep it all
right that's so great everybody and now
let's talk about what if I need to count
something based on the conditions given
okay look at on the screen and let me
complete this one then you can try after
me okay so my first question is like
total number of entries you can use
count a blank entries You Can Count use
the count blank but I need to know uh in
the column C we have some new customers
visited at my place or at my uh Outlet
at my uh you know uh desk any any kind
of a statement could be uh I only wants
to count the uh new type so when the
condition comes I told you guys one
formula is sufficient for you is like
count ifs you want to count something
but that is an condition comes which is
say count ifs so it says give me the
range so first range select it the
column C comma and it say and guys guys
listen some range will not be there why
because we are not using some if it is
Count ifs so it say criteria so you can
write in between double inverted
comma or you can select any new in the
sales both are correct and I hit enter
that's my answer is 20 okay it means
that we have a 20 new customers visited
at my place okay
and let me cross check if I just write
it existing so now that's become 19 it
means it's working very well now one
more let me try and the last one you
have to try after me okay I wanted to
count I know the total collection we do
have is 24 correct but now my manager or
maybe I wants to know how many
collections do we receive do we get
having the amount above of 100 and Below
of 200 it means it is a situation of
between case look how I will handle this
count ifs it says give me the range I'm
giving the range is column
D comma one side I wanted to only keep
the number which is above of 100 so I
will put double comma greater than 100
clear one I I have defined the story as
per the argument criteria range and
criteria where I put comma again it says
give me the range again look at their
argument it says give me the range again
and I'm I told you everyone if you have
to very good in Excel with in in terms
of formulas always look at the arguments
I'm going to select it all that's D
comma and it says now tell me what is
your next criteria I said start with 100
above but close it before or is equal to
200 so whatever value you find out in
between count it and answer me and that
is the right answer which is four
everyone okay so here is a formula for
you try and last one you have to answer
me once you complete this these
two your time starts now
everybody really appreciate for for
people those who have the answer is to
okay because uh it is uh it is based on
the three conditions okay those who have
not yet done I would say guys focus on
my screen let me complete this for you
because uh you know I'm telling you guys
those who are not maybe uh not trying or
maybe not doing it uh because I'm not
getting the responses in the chat window
I must say guys while watching this one
everything seems to be very easy stuff
but exactly after couple of days when
when the really requirement comes to you
now you will get stuck so let's get
stuck today here and get the solution of
it okay I'm going to say count
ifs is a criteria range it could be
start from any then you can start from
column D you can start from column B you
can start from column A up to you I
start with column B in column B where
what do I have to focus I have to focus
on Mr Brooks because that my question is
in January Mr Brooks bring the thousands
above amount how many that I need to
count I Define this one comma then it
says like range number two it's like
this one and in this one in this column
A need to focus on January only so you
wish you can type the January in between
double ined comma you can
select a comma here and the third column
is d d where I I wanted to only count
the numbers which is
above thousand so the overall condition
is Mr Brooks when the amount is more
than thousand in the month of January
whatever the numbers he bring it for the
company count it and I'm going I hit
enter and that's my answer that's a two
okay really appreciate for people those
who have who get this right number those
who have not yet done this is for you
quickly complete so we can move forward
all right everybody save that's great so
I have waited for your response here
okay and now uh statistical functions
part where we discuss about the sum ifs
functions we learn how to use average
ifs function here we discuss about the
count count a we learn what is the use
of count blank and count I s can you
just give me information guys are you
now confident and clear with all these
functions please give me a response
everybody yes that's the spread okay
um I am just
wondering why not uh like see till this
moment you you done the things what I
said but I explained to do that okay so
how can we be sure that are we okay with
this one are we really know this
functions to use so I have an activity
everybody it's a I think two to three
minutes of activity and an activity I'm
I have a plan to do that come to the
next sheet of it as you can see everyone
I have a database this one okay and let
me Zoom it before you asking this so uh
everyone just look at this this is the
data and here is my expected question
for you all just like some of units for
Mr devalue so in this gray out color
this gr line gr cell gr out C you guys
have to use the formula I do not know
which formula will you use but read the
question carefully and the best part of
this activity everyone I have already
written the answer so your answer has to
match with mine if you matched it it
means you know how to use these
functions shall we do it
now excited
everyone come on try and wherever you
stuck it's a five not five 3 minutes
activity okay try and complete all the
questions and match the answer with
mine can I share the sheet I think uh uh
you're already working I I am on the
next sheet
simple all right
everybody I hope the answers are getting
match okay ask you have a question
average un of product in May my values
come just increase the two decimal
digits
as good job
jages I'm waiting for others response
too yeah able to do a single one semi is
it oh come on it is the first question
is about the sum ifs
try and I'm sure you're GNA get this one
okay good job
R tusha very good all matching bra
that's great I appreciate
everyone
wow all match huh that's one
F which one V is not
matching wow all match that's
great then if you able to do the first
one shimmy then second question is also
based on some ifs now total sales in
January this one okay look at on the
screen I'm going to do that one quickly
everybody those who have not done yet
some ifs is says Su range I'm going to
select the column D because units I'm
looking for and uh Mr the value I
selected close my bracket enter uh oh oh
oh sorry uh range I forgot to select the
range select the column B comma select
Mr the value enter and see so answer is
matching so what's the big deal
can't found the first
one just look at there
Ste is equal to Su ifs Su range I'm
looking for column D
comma criteria it is about the devalue
and devalue is no more that's my sales
person in my company so I select the
range and then I select this one Mr de
value
and I hit enter and I think that's
absolutely matchable
answer got
it okay that's good
one okay so p is not getting the one
is the one is which one which one is
Mr
uh okay this one okay it is again the
question of some i
fs uh I'm looking for uh units total so
I select the column D comma the value is
my sales person I will select any the
value like thisa and then the product is
Da the column C you have to select and
in this C you can see the da is
there okay P when you hit enter your
answer is going to get matched with
mine okay that's great and yeah anyone
is here who have issues so second one
what happens in me it's very simple look
at there I'm going to use this equal to
sum
ifs because when I mention the total
means sum I'm going to say have some
range of cell column e
month is January select the range first
and then choose any
January yeah there it is or you can
select this one too close the
bracket that's the
answer
okay okay so your question is like
average what um average sales in daily
average sales in Daily so average
ifs equals
to
average i
fs average range sales I selected column
e and criteria range will be column C
where the product will be daily close
the bracket enter if it is coming like
4926 not too worry you can increase the
decimals is like one and two that's
answer I'm moving to uh to the next
sheet everyone those who have not done
yet this is this will be another five uh
Simi you can try that's one as an
homework okay and you can come to the
next class you can try not five minute
you can take the whole time but I would
simply advised you try because when you
try either you will get the answer or
you will get the wrong thing wrong
answer so let the wrong answer come but
at least try so that you will have you
know a question to ask me ask me and I
will help you out okay great and uh now
I'm sure like this is clear okay before
jump into the next uh one everybody uh
how was this activity guys does this
give you some confidence in these
formulas it's cool that's great is
that's called the good things here and
now I am moving forward and let's see
what next we have to discuss oh okay a
very very interesting and important in
this we're going to discuss about the
logical
operator first I will explain then I'll
give you a question and I'm sure
everybody can perform this one okay so
let me show you the first question hey
everyone I'm in this logical operator
right and logical operator basically in
Microsoft Excel or in any
other you know uh programming language
application uh this one used a lot so
basically the operator the mathematical
operators do we have is like greater
than less than okay we have is equal to
we have not is equal to correct we have
greater than R is equal to we have less
than R is equal this is what this is
your mathematical operators
fine now apart from this logical
operator if we if we say so we have if
logical
operator we have a nested if logical
operator sometime if with and logical
operator
if
with or logical operator so these four
operators you should learn and you
should everybody learn and why am I
saying this one because uh you know most
of the uh most of the queries get solved
and will be dependent on the if logical
statement if you have to understand this
one I would say
just keep it one thing in your mind
which is
a
true a false simple a true or a false so
whenever you toss a coin so the expected
answer will be either the your
expectation which is will be true or the
false so when you define true so false
will comes automatically let's suppose
start from here I have the SEI numbers I
have some of this students are there who
appears for the exam is level one level
two and level three these are their
marks and this is the total performance
which is coming 21 now if you have just
imagine if you have the university data
and you can understand how many students
are uh studying there so if you have the
thousands plus customers data uh
thousand plus students database and now
you got a criteria like those students
who scored more than 15 will or more
than uh 18 let's say more than 18 if
your marks you will be passed but if
your marks is 18 or less than 18 you
will be failed this is the
condition so first statement I'm telling
you like how will you write the code
here it's not code it's like how will
you write a formula but before writing
the formula I just wanted to check if
you just look at this one everybody is
coming
21 so he has to be a
pass right because I said 18 above but
if someone is getting 18 he will fail so
look how I can cross check this one is
equal to select the cell and I'm going
to say more than 18 I am just giving
this instruction to excel go and check
in the cell F4 is it more than 18 when I
hit enter that gives me true when I do
double click on it I'm getting somewhere
true somewhere false and I'm like okay
the true means pass a false means
fail I need to have a formula that keeps
me you know the rights to uh fill pass
instead of true fill fail instead of
false so first what we learn here we
learn how to to cross check is it true
or false I have cross checked it so now
I will just write a formula is called
if so if your logical test always
remember this is the way we are testing
the logic we just say if this cell F4 is
above of
18
comma when you given the logic now
everyone it will ask ask you two things
there the first one is value if true
remember the true and false was coming
so it says okay sir tell me what value
you want if I found true and I'm like
give me answer is like
f comma then it says okay sir tell me
what if I found anything
incorrect if I found anything 18 or less
than 18 means that is false so I can say
don't write Falls there you can just
type there fail and I close my bracket
and I hit enter and look everyone how
easily you got your answer there pass
fail pass fail doesn't matter if the
number are five or 5,000 there just
apply this condition drag it down and
you will have your status over here just
try your first logical statement
everybody uh F4 is nothing but the cell
add address C don't be confused with
this one what is this F4 F4 look at
there it's an F it's a four so that is a
cell address okay so based on it we
Define the condition so what is a big
deal if it is like you thinking like
okay I need 18 has to be passed so you
can just write greater than R is equal
to greater than R is equal to it means
18 or above 18 if we just write this one
double click on it and look now the guy
who scored 18 itself called pass you
know what everyone that is the first
example of your logical statement okay I
will Define the logic one by one and
side by I'll give you a question to
perform this one come to this sheet if
exercise one
everyone just come to the exercise one
here and now try this this table first
this one okay I'm just giving you the
situation try to perform this and then
we'll move
forward let me let me increase this
one see everybody the question is very
simple as you can see here is the
expectation and here is the sales we
done you can see everyone
600,000
600,000 uh is the expected sales but
someone has made
450,000 or you can say 450,00 ,000 is
what he or she made or done so you tell
me guys the stat should be achieved or
not achieved as for this
situation expected as expected was six
lakh achieved is like
450,000 or you can say
450,000 the status should be achieved or
not achieved so I don't know namata on
what basis you are saying achieved
if the target is 600,000 and you achieve
450,000 so how it can be achieved yes
now just go ahead everybody and
get complete this one and answer me how
many achieved and how many not achieved
there it's a small data so don't count
it manually okay I need that logical
function applied and get the achieve and
the not achieved
okay all right all right so I'm getting
answer is like three achieved and two
not achieved okay so look how will you
do that if if you are saying if expected
or yourself anything you can take let's
suppose if I'm taking if my sell is
still above or equals to my
target okay if my sale is above or
equals to my target it means I have
achieved my target okay
otherwise it's like not
achieved so I'm going to close my
bracket and I hit enter so it says not
achieved and I'm going to drag it down
guys my answer is like three not
achieved and two achieved how you cross
check see it is achieve it is also
achieve admin cross
check y so please reverse the reverse
your question huh I think the greater
than sign may be greater than you guys
are by mistak and putting there the less
than sign I hope so so I'm just waiting
guys those if anyone is there who is
still not yet done so please complete it
because I have few more questions for
you okay guys would you like to try one
more task so it will be based on the uh
it will be based on the uh the banking
database okay I'm just giving your task
performed it hey everyone you can see
that uh I have the account types some
people having current account some
people having savings account okay and
it's a big data just imagine okay and
there's a closing balance so now the
bank has decided those who have the
current account we will
charge
5%
interest okay those those accounts
holder having a saving account a saving
account one second so we will charge
25% interest on it and 05% will be
charge on what it will be charge on
their closing
balance okay come on everyone show me
your skills and bring me the right
number Mr salil Jan what is
his bank charges based on their account
type try and answer me let me Steve my
question is very simple look at there
you can see we have a account number
customers's name account type closing
balance so this guy the first guy look
at their account type is current account
holder so as for the bank bank charge
interest you knows it right so his
account type is current so bank will
charge.
5% 5% of what score closing balance you
can just calculate the exact Bank
charges clear to you the interest amount
you have to charge based on their
account
type clear
Nam now is this your question clear to
you so just complet it and let me know
so P says first one is 62.5
zero wonderful P let me wait for two
more minutes let everyone's try then
I'll answer well
625 well I don't think so all right
everyone just look at on the screen I
found some of the answer is like ashin
says
6,250 so ashin just think about 12,500
is his balance 5% if I
charge okay don't don't feel uh bad
anybody okay it is just a part of my
workshop but I just wanted to make you
familiar with your you know the the one
you are you're working on so look how
will you write this one uh is equal to
if I'm going to say first go and check
is it current so I'm going to say
current I just write this if it is
current let's suppose if it is current
yes it is so I'm going to say closing
balance has to multiply with
0.5% this is your Excel is completely
mathematical right so 0.5% do charge if
it is current otherwise otherwise if it
is not current so obviously it will be
saving so I'm going to say otherwise
mean if it is false so simply charge.
25% okay I'm going to close my bracket
and I hit enter and that's coming
62.5 this is the way you should perform
clear now those who haven't yet done
please copy the same nobody is that's
okay again please Shivam just look at
this one you wanted to charge
uh Bank charges okay so I'm going to
start with this one so what is my
conditions if the account type is equal
to what a
current then charge .5% on what on the
closing balance so multiply with
.5% otherwise otherwise
charge
25%
simple all right all right everybody
hopefully this is done and see two
examples I have just given to you there
could be one more situation is like what
if aim we have more than one account so
I'm just coming on it anyone is here was
still not yet done so I'll wait complete
it then I'll give you one more example
for it perfect one so look at here I'm
going to talk about the last one one
more exercise for you all Jag this as
you maybe not remember like I told you
like whenever whenever we write any text
any text text always defined between
double quotation this is a mandatory
this a logical operator mandatory things
however if it is a number number don't
write in between double quotes don't
write why because if you write this on
that become a text and text can't get
multiply and all that's why now I'm
coming to the point of this one
everybody just look at there it's a
region is given we have salesman hard
dis the items we sold uh uh in this
table I found that quantity and price is
is given here right so here are few of
the sales are blank okay sales are blank
so I know this is not a very difficult
question for you you can is equal to
multiply this one with this enter hit
and you will have your answer when I
drag it down I found that here is coming
zero 0o
zero if I ask you like why it is coming
zero your answer will be because of the
quantity cell is empty that's why it is
coming zero I'm like okay and it is
correct like it's a mathematical concept
and it is absolutely correct no problem
at all but I need
something here and that is like
see I want if if the quantity cell is
blank then do not show me anything into
the amount section look how I'm going to
say if is blank which one is blank a
quantity is
blank if is blank which one a quantity
cell which is L6 is blank then give me
the answer blank and blank to be defined
as an double inverted comma two times
without space if you want to show a
blank eror in your formula you can
express this one with double quotes
without
space so if it is blank show me blank
otherwise otherwise multiply it with a
price simple I'm going to close my
bracket and see it's not blank 76,000 is
coming now when I drag it down if these
all are coming blind why I teach you I'm
telling you see look if I deleted
nothing is coming if you got a chance to
create a templates and all so you can
create a template like this when you
start writing the numbers into it then
the numbers appear then the amount
appear and if you just delete it it will
get
EMP this is the way you can utilize your
if logical statements too now you can
copy this go
ahead so I believe that everyone has
done with this one so everybody like see
this is your if logical statement I have
given three to four examples for you so
that like the things has to be clear
right uh with the operators and along
with this if is blank now I'm coming
back to my sheet logical operators here
now what if like see the first
conditions we discuss if more than 18
marks will be will be passed if less
than 18 will be fail but what if like
see for example I am going to minimize
this
one let me explain one more conditions
to you all everyone because this is very
important for you guys just look at
there now we have to find out the grade
grade here I'm going to name it like a
grade right but the parameter for
grading is absolutely different just
look at there so what is is the
parameters the parameter is like if any
student score if any students score is
in between 0 to 15 marks 0 to five marks
sorry so grade will be
F 5 to less than 10 e
10 to 15 less than see look at the ha
here is less than 15 means less than 15
okay so 10 to less than 15 will be D 15
to less than 20 will be C so it means
that I have to write if I have to write
again if again if again if other see
because we have to Define multiple
conditions over here right right so
question is like how can I do this one
so look at on my screen let
me almost I can see
this hey everyone when you have multiple
conditions multiple if
condition so that condition we called it
a nested if condition look how it will
get
done I'm going to start with the simple
if condition it says logical T the
grades are based on the
performance and one cell I'm taking as a
calculation so every time the same cell
you have to select the expression will
be changed all the time I said if F4
means the total performance is less than
five see I start with this less than
okay less than five comma then a grade
will be F correct less than five means
all numbers 4 3 2 1 will be f
grade so true is f then false false will
start from five or above
five please respond me if you agree with
with this
statement the false value will be five
five or above
five if it is clear to you so you can
simply write there again if and you are
going to say if the score is five or
above five but less than 10 then I want
a grade is like
e okay again you can say if of
performance see less than 10 means what
that is 9 8 7 7 6 and five so true I
have defined a false false means 10 or
above than 10 so I can directly say now
less than 15 so that is automatically
coming in between I'm going to say if it
is there so I need D and if it is more
than 15 but less than less say 20 I want
to see the grade
C again comma if it is more than
20 if it is more than 20 but less than
25 I need a
Grade B again you can say if the score
F4 is more than
25 but less than r equal to 30 then just
give me answer is a correct then you can
close the bracket 1 2 3 4 five why five
because if bracket open if bracket open
if bracket open so when you hit enter
and you will have your answer is here
everyone this guy gets 21 as for the
statement you can see 20 and 25 means
it's
B now when I do double click on it and
see I'm getting a perfect result over
here everyone that is called a nestive
condition now you can try and copy the
SC go ahead
everybody all right yep so completed and
confirmed to me
everyone well uh once you're done with
this okay
that's wonderful everybody and here we
see you know what your nestive condition
is being just completed here right
but exercise two and exercise three is
an task for you let me explain the
question my situation is there if not so
tomorrow when we meet I just start the
defining the situ the conditions from
here okay at least try both of them it's
very simple uh you you need to calculate
the discount discount if your product's
price is between this nil 1,001 to 4,000
2% discount will be 4,1 to 5,000 between
2.5% or 5,000 above 3% discount that's
you need to calculate and you can come
to the exercise three everyone and this
here you have to calculate the shipping
cost as you can see a cleaning of frozen
food soft drinks all amount is being
given here if you purchase cleaning
we'll give you shipping cost free if you
purchase Frozen Foods 25 will be
chargeable is it clear to you all
everyone I hope everyone will try to
complete this exercise two and exercise
three
hopefully hello everybody and welcome
back
that's wonderful that's wonderful okay
so before moving ahead let's have a
quick recap what we have discussed last
day so it is all about business
analytics we are here the purpose of uh
we here to discuss on the business
analytics part through Microsoft Excel I
was started my session start with the
interface of this application what is
there the data cleansing
activity so I have given uh you know the
the ideas how to modify the numbers date
replace function go to spatial command
and some of the shortcut keys I have
they given you idea how to get it the
current date current time uh like date
and time all together only time the
updated one if you want
to get or you want it to uh write there
so with uh know you can do the Now
function - 2 fine and after that then we
started discussing about the functions
and the formulas so we have started with
the some basic formulas just like sum
statistical sum Max minimum and average
then I shows you the next label of it I
mean to say if you want to get the total
but based on certain conditions these
formulas just to have a grip on it guys
because further when I will come to uh
explain about the dashboard cre ation so
this formula help you a lot to
understand the logic behind it okay so
some ifs function we discussed that
helps you to bring data the total based
on certain conditions given a condition
could be one or it can be more than one
okay they can be average ifs function
there is an count count a count blank
count ifs function along with one
exercise we have uh you know uh we have
completed last we correct
so JIS you said please explain a
statistical analysis part one
okay part one exercise two the third
question exercise two the third question
okay so is this one this answer
me okay so it is like all except I would
like to tell you one thing guys uh you
know like this is the sign of is equal
to okay and this is the sign of not is
equal but the problem is we do not have
the symbol like this in our keyboard we
don't have correct so how to explain a
not is equal to so uh the operator I
told you last day you can utilize the
operator like less than and greater than
this is the sign I'm sorry but this and
this this is the sign of not is equal to
so let me uh explain this one and and
see the question is very simple I wanted
to uh get the all except n counties list
price having bedroom more than five and
bathroom more than three so I'm going to
start with this little Zoom
first is equal to it's like some
ifs this is like some range so list
price is talking about so list prize is
available in the column A I've given and
now it says like uh all except n
counties all except n counties so when
you select the column
C and
comma so look when you select this
column C everyone so it means you have
defined the column C's that having all
the name so if I'm going to write there
like double quotes
and and counties it means I'm talking
about the N count is only right but when
it is says not is equal all except is
not is equal you have to start with this
like you know uh less than or greater
than and then exactly the way it is
there in the table you have to mention
the name is like n
Dot County okay and one more thing
everyone like if you will Define this
less than or greater than sign you must
have to write the name okay because when
you type this one in between double ined
comma so it is it become a text down so
do not select the cell right you have to
type this one n county comma then it
says a bedroom has to be more than five
so I select the column
D more than five I told you you can
write this way and then bathroom is this
one and
like this and I hit enter and my answer
is coming zero so let me just cross
check for example control shift l
so except n
County uh bedroom is more than five you
can see that like if I more than five I
don't have any correct so that's why it
is coming zero
answer okay see you got that zero
because uh I'm telling you see you did
not Define that not is equal to symbol
okay although the data is not there the
data is not there so it is coming as a
zero but whenever you have to write you
have to say not is equal to you must
have to type in between double inverted
comma and less than and greater than
symbol right because I'm telling you one
more thing guys just look when you write
100 100 is a number but when you write
greater than 100 now that's become a
text and how will you define the text
you will have to Define it between
double inverted
comma perfect one so I hope this is done
everyone and I left my exercise there so
I just wanted to ask you is this one
have you complete everybody netive or
you want me to explain this one come
on well uh a very less response is there
so let me explain this one okay
my question is very simple everyone I
wanted to calculate the discount
discounts parameter I have given here
okay and I'm telling you everyone
practically it is it will not be there
in your database this is something which
will be in your mind okay this is what I
have to define the conditions okay so it
says the first line is 0 to th000 th000
means up to th000 so I can simple write
if select the price less than th000
means what less than th000 means up to
th000 up to, so if I'm saying if E2 that
is a price if it is less than thousand
then I need the answer has to be nil
correct comma so true you have defined
true you have defined what numbers will
be false the numbers which is thousands
are above so I'm going to say if the
price value is Thousands start with
thousands are above but less than
4,000 so we will charge 2% discount but
the discount will be charged on what
discount will be charged on a price
value so that multiply with the price
now this is the true you have def finded
between thousands to 4,000 comma which
value will be false the value which is
above of 4,000
I'm going to say if the price above of
4,000 but below of 5,000 then you have
to
provide 2.5% discount on price value
comma again again you have to say false
false is what the value which is above
of 5,000 so what you can do you can
write if you can select it right and you
can say above R is equal to if it is
5,000 then simple say 3% discount on
what it's a price so I told you last day
everyone The Logical operator says like
if the bracket is open here here here
here the four if is there four
parentheses are open you have to close
it like one 2 3 4 and just hit enter it
will simply calculate that one directly
just do double click on the corner and
you will have the perfect result over
here okay come on everyone complete it
now well if you just observe Adin look
at my condition see that is uh 0 to
th000 okay sorry fine so as for the
condition is like 0 to th000 huh like in
this situation you can keep it that less
than or equal to th because I didn't
that that that is starts from 1,1 thanks
for this one so you can keep this one
less than R is equal to everywhere then
you will have the perfect answer okay
and in this case it has to be only
greater than right admin and yes s me
just look at there this is the if
logical St I
explain so now you can copied
it all right everybody so hopefully this
is done but I didn't get the responses
here in the chat window it will be great
if you can confirm me otherwise I need
to move
ahead all right so look pricee is there
discount is there okay if I need to
calculate the amount I'm telling you a
problem statement there so how will
calculate the amount the amount will be
like you know uh first I did one thing
price minus discount whatever the amount
comes then I will multiply with the
quantity this is the way I will
calculate the uh exact amount to be paid
by the customer when I hit enter
everybody that is coming the total now
when I do double click to the corner of
it uh oh I'm getting problem there I'm
getting error over here if I ask you
like why it is coming error your answer
will be because aim it is an Al alphabet
an alphabet cannot be a part of
calculation so if I ask what is the
solution for it then your answer will be
like rather than writing the nil you can
just type there zero hey this is
something you all knows I wanted to make
you one step further
expert I am I don't want to make changes
into this nil this nil I need to be
there as it is but still I want my
answer so look
everyone how to tackle with error in
Excel IF the error is coming and you
wanted to avoid this please use this
formula which is called an if error
function this says first tell me your
formula and I'm like bracket open price
minus discount multiply with quantity
write that function
the way you write it before correct and
then comma when you write when you put a
comma it will ask you value if error
means what value you want if there is an
error and I'm like okay rather than
showing me error only multiply quantity
with price why because nil means nil nil
means zero and once it's multi mly with
this and I hit enter look where the
discount is it's calculates when I do
double click and see I'm getting my
answer okay nail is there but you should
learn one more formula that is called if
addor everyone right come on copy the
same well rajes you tell me are you able
to share your screen maybe probably I
can help you out okay meanwhile everyone
copy the same now moving forward
everybody and let's have a one more case
to discuss with you all just imagine you
are working in an HR department you have
the punching record like this okay the
employees punching database and now my
management says other can you please
count how
many uh staff are absent today and how
many are present today
so this absentees and present counting I
can do only now when I have the exact
attendance there so as per the
condition from the company like if
anyone reach office after 10:00 a.m.
morning consider him or her as an absent
else give them present it's very simple
condition I'm going to write this if
select this one and I'm going to say on
R before
10 okay so how you
write 10 a.m. you write the way like
this okay then you are saying uh if it
is 10 or before 10 so let's consider him
or her as in present otherwise absent
when I hit enter I got that error
message the error message comes because
of because of your log iCal operator did
not understand what exactly it
is so what to
do whenever you have a time constraint
listen to me everyone whenever you have
a time constraint please use time itself
a formula okay time itself a formula it
is like time it says give me the
hour comma minute comma second so when
you write this one then you can say it
will be
present otherwise it will be absent so
when I hit enter I can see my answer
there present absent present absent
present absent look Sita agal Ser office
and punch it by 1 second delay and see
is absent to do so now when you have the
data like this then you can try the
formula is like count
ifs select the range comma select the
absent enter you can see sir seven
people are absent and count
ifs
select
comma and select present close the
bracket enter wow seven people absent
and seven people present there okay so
that is really good work
fine so complete this one too everybody
go ahead all
right this is greater than our equal to
I'm getting error message it is less
than Vijay Focus less than it is a less
than okay it's not greater
then can you show to how to apply I did
uh double click on it and see or you can
just hold it from the corner okay hold
it from the corner and drag it like this
so you will get
result applied to there Zoom it it is
already Zoom
130% what do you say is it visible
now um Sim me you can use count ifs
function
simple I told you the formula count
ifs you tried you're getting zero okay
look at there I use this way count ifs
select the entire range and then I just
select the cell any
absent try and answer me you're getting
a wrong message and someone is getting
error can you show me your formula uh
can you just copy and paste your formula
there in the chat window uh Vijay and
Nam both here the formula
open if C2 is less than or equal to
time oh my God oh my God what is this n
when you close the parenthesis why you
not giving a small comma there without
it how it can jump on a true and
false and what's wrong with you VI when
you type this present so did you define
a single comma to jump on false why you
making a small
mistake and see VI your formula is is
even is is not started with if it is a
completely coming start with is equal to
if and you start your formula with C2 I
don't know why but this is if
condition okay at least start with this
is equal to if bracket open
C2 well I cannot see in the chat window
that's what I'm saying and why after C2
there is an
comma
why when you define finding the logic
and in between The Logical statement who
said to put a comma please remove that
comma and comp and put a comma after
present even you will have your answer
you can just try this formula of Mind n
what about you have you done with this
you get my
point
wonderful VI complet it quickly now
now moving forward everybody and let's
see what is the next logical statements
I'm going to explain to you all hey
everyone again it's a very practical
question for you all and look at that
it's
a let me Zoom a little more so that it
will be visible
properly okay hey everyone so look at
there I have a target of the month
parameter given
okay look at that the month Target is
you have to made a sale of
150,000 or in another way you can say
150,000 or above minimum 150,000 is
fixed that is the one Target and second
target is you need to open a new account
10 or more than 10 10 10 or more than 10
so if anyone achieve both of the target
then the organization will give them a
4% commission so as for the business
analytics part this is you who will do
this analysis based on the multiple
parameters and answer them so for
example let's say the case of Mr Al he
made a sale of
250,000 or
250,000 and he open eight new accounts
you tell me all will
alas get the
commission or not as per his
performance and then answer is obviously
is like
no reason because uh he fulfilled the
first condition but he is not fulfilling
the second condition so that's why so
the question is like how will you tackle
if if you have more than one conditions
together and all conditions are
mandatory so how will you handle this to
handle this your if logical statement
says use and a and the operator it says
the and functions we use in such a case
when we have multiple logical statements
and all Logics are mandatory logic
number one a cell that has to be above R
is equal to
150,000 comma logic number two select
the open
account that it should be 10 or above 10
now close my bracket because my logic
has been completed if you achieve both
of them then you're going to get a 4%
commission otherwise you're going to get
zero when I hit enter so Al gets zero
when I do double click to the corner of
it I'm getting 4% 4% why because they
fulfill both condition
okay try
now U please explain it again okay so
look at there if if with and but first l
Logic the cell the cell has to be above
about equal to 150,000 that is the first
logic second a new account open that
also has to be 10 or above 10 if both of
them true I need 4% as in commission
otherwise I need
zero right ktic so complete it now and
confirmed
me moving forward everybody and let's
see what next so the last of the logical
operator and that is like see when you
have the same data just imagine if you
have the same data and but the situation
is is is is is you know different point
I'm coming to this exercise six see I
have the same table here I have a same
table here and I but but the condition
is is slightly changed
now and why it is change because company
observed that some of the people are
disappointed okay so uh now company has
changed the policy now company says that
either you achieve your sell Target or
or I'm I'm using a word like or here or
you achieve a new 10 account open if any
one of you achieve okay if any um one of
you achieve so you will get a 4%
commission so let's check it out so when
you have m multiple conditions and if
any condition is true and you wanted to
get the true answer go ahead with this R
statement and I'm going to say or either
your sell has to be above or equal to
150,000 or your new account open has to
be 10 or above 10 if any one of is true
then your answer will be 4% otherwise it
will be zero and look now Mr
do is Happy okay double click on it and
see these two people are not getting
because they didn't achieve any one of
that's why it's coming 0% but rest is
getting 4% off copy
this no you can't use because uh if the
first one is coming as in truth it
always gives you a true the true answer
okay uh further it will not move to
cross check another logic that's why
well I'm telling you I don't know uh
okay let me show you now you guys don't
get confused with this one this nested
if uh so why we are learning extra and
or condition I'm telling you see what
I'm saying if I'm going to write this if
and I'm going to say this one if this is
above R equals to
150,000 Okay so I need 4% correct comma
if this one is above is equal to 10 then
also I need a 4% off this is the way you
are going to write nest so don't be
confused let me do that one so that you
will get the idea comma otherwise zero
okay you can close the bracket and hit
enter fine it's coming 4% okay now let's
suppose this is uh like you know 1,000
see now why is coming zero
answer me why it is coming zero I it
should move and check the next condition
but it is not
moving it is not
moving those who ask me this question
can you please respond me why when I
made the sales of thousands only so why
it is not giving me a
4% it should move now and cross but it
will not it will not
okay that is the reason I said use R
statement keep all the Logics at one
place so that it will cross check one by
one by one by one and wherever it finds
true it gives you an answer true hope
that makes sense to you all being
clear well
I well see I'm not getting the response
maybe I if this things is is still not
yet clear so guys if you ask me I can
make it clear or you know I'll observe
like this is clear to you all okay and
mo let me answer of your point you are
mean to say that uh we uh for and
condition not for or condition you tell
me did you understand the differences
between and and or yes or
no yes then what is the question there
then and Karthik if you're asking to me
differences between R and and statement
I must say you need to compare both
one see in the previous sheet why alas
is not getting percentage a commission
come to this sheet exercise six and see
why Al is getting the the commission you
will get your answer let's observe this
one
practically
okay because there is an thousands of
definition for and and or but I want you
just go and get the clarity between the
result all right all right everyone so
here we we done with this uh you know uh
the if Ned
if if with and if with or okay
and uh I have also given one more
conditions to you how to deal with if
with you
know the time frame the time
constraint
nowed
if yeah I have just written the
statements there can you just informed
me are you guys clear with all these
logical
operators and that's wonderful everybody
so now moving forward and let's see
hopefully the pace is okay for all
anyone is here who still not yet
completed you can ping me in the chat
window okay perfect so now coming to
you did not why is it so the formula is
still open here on my screen n complete
it
now wonderful then so moving forward
everybody so after having this logical
operators being clear to you all it's
time to discuss about the references
okay so everyone come to the sheet is
called absolute reference let me clear
the concept of absolute reference here
so
what exactly it is and when and where we
have to use this concept I told you last
day uh if you remember that FN key with
F4 so when you are freezing the cell I'm
repeating when you are freezing the cell
that's Concept in Excel we called it an
absolute reference so just look at that
how it's going to be happen here so for
example Mr these are the sales person
data we have and uh this is the Sal is
what they have made they have done and
now my camp now the organization wants
me to calculate the percentage
contribution and it is very simple now
the mathematical concept says the
contribution by Mr hindel s divided by
the grand total of
it when I select this and I hit enter I
found that
24.8 3% is the percentage contrib Fusion
now when I drag it
down uhoh I'm getting divisional error
and I told you guys whenever you are
getting the error so do not delete your
formulas instantly observe this one key
where am I making mistake when I double
click on it I found the cell is moving
this is the default relative cell
reference uh setting in Excel if you
will drag your cell all the cell will
keep moving here but this one I don't
want to I don't want allow to get moved
so the question is like how can I fix
this
one so when I select the cell divided by
and I'm coming to this one when I'm
coming to this this one you need to
press
F4 just press F4 maybe directly if you
press F4 it will come or it will come
with FN key plus F4 now if you hit enter
and drag it down and you will have your
answer okay try
now all right all right everybody does
great so I gu the response is here
hopefully this concept is clear to you
all now you can come to the next sheet
everyone and let's talk about the next
one okay now this is going to be very
interesting for you all okay
look I have a very
simple data I prepared for you
all let's suppose you are in the
management you have these are the
salesperson working under your guidance
and this is their monthly achievement
Target month
okay so uh if you just look at there
this table everyone I have mention the
percentage there 2% in Jan 3% in 5 4% in
March it means that I need to calculate
the percentage based on all these
numbers
correct if I ask you to do this you know
what this is the concept you're going to
apply the amount multiply with the
percentage so maybe you will freeze the
target one or maybe you will freeze the
percentage one when I hold it I freeze
the percentage and I drag it
down it's
done but the problem is I cannot drag it
towards the right side if I do that the
problem is this one all the time will be
will be freeze always it will be 2% and
the second problem is this cell is keep
moving to the right side
that is the kind of problems we face in
Excel that's why we used to apply the
formula in every single column of it
okay this is what we do so if you are in
this Workshop so why not let me tell you
a concept everyone where we will use one
formula only one time and we will drag
and drop and we'll get the answer y see
the manually one by one column
calculation you know how to handle but
just learn One More Concept simple
things
remember this is what I have selected is
called a column this is this direction
we called it a row simple very very
simple concept I'm repeating again this
direction is called a
row this direction of selection the
selection is called a column I hope
there will be no problem to understand
this because you can see it's a column
it's a row correct in Excel if you
remember this one so this one is becom
so easy to understand just look is equal
to I select
it I select this one it means I am
selecting the area from the
column from the
column so in this cell what is a column
is it b or is it four in this cell what
is a column is it b or is it
four is it it is B so you just need to
put a dollar sign before B and then
multiply now I'm selecting the cell from
the row side from the row side so in
this cell
C2 the row is two you can put a dollar
manually before row and look at the
magic here I hit enter and I'm going to
drag
it drop it I have my answer is there
this is called a make cell reference
concept okay please try now you know
what everyone not only to copy and paste
the formula okay please please every
time try to connect the things what I
I'm explaining to you because the the
concept is going to help you a lot in
while using look of functionality okay
one side you can say a column is
constant another side you can say a row
is constant okay ad and that's why we
call this one as an mixed cell reference
concept now you must have to concentrate
it's not about the prefix and suffix
okay
it is about the dollar sign before the
row and before the
column well you can type if you're very
confident so
see obviously you can like you know if
you just uh here you can uh select this
one so you have to decide the area which
you have selected is it from the column
side or is it from the row side because
this is that one of the basic way I have
I try to explain this one if you have
selected the cell from the column side
just put a cursor before and put the
dollar sign right but if you know like
okay I don't want to go there and I want
to type this on my so who stop you put
that dollar sign type B type uh four
that is
coming okay all right everyone so you
know what absolute ref refence be
understood Mixel reference do this one
please keep it with you and I'm I
guaranteed you guys are going to enjoy
this
one uh this concept in look of
functionality which I'm just going to
start
now all right everyone so uh now if you
come to the sheet is called there is
references and there is an we look up
fors so I am going to start discussing
about about the look of
functionality and you knows it very much
guys like if there is an interview
anybody is based on the look of
functionality so the interviewer's
favorite part to ask a question based on
the look of values look of function okay
you should be good with this one uh why
because uh you know there is a certain
reason behind it and I have many more
sheets are there which we will complete
one by one so you will have more clarity
and every sheet has a different aspect
every sheet has a different questioner
there different situation there so all
the situation you have to solve it and
try to connect like okay this is the
kind of problem if I face I'll use the
lookup function there okay basically uh
lookup function is being divided into
two part of it one is called we
lookup and another one is called the Ed
look up
okay most of the cases we solve with we
look up there and there is one reason
because in our corporate data mostly the
data is being prepared in a vertical
manner so the V lookup is being
apply but sometime the data if it is
coming in a hor is onal manner so we can
use the H look up rather than
transposing this I would say use H look
up function okay so v stand for vertical
h stand for horizontal look up the
important question is
see to understand this look of function
it hardly 10 minutes of job okay hardly
10 minutes of job for me to make you
understand this formula but you know
what like learning is one thing learning
is one thing you
should
understand when and where and what kind
of a situation we have so I can use this
look of
functionality because I have uh faced
this kind of issues with the people they
will know how to use we lookup but just
because they don't know when when and
where we have to use they got stuck and
someone comes and help them out sir
please try we look and you will get your
answer so try to learn this function in
such a way not only to get the clarity
of the arguments but also get the things
clear this is the situation I can use V
lookup okay I'm giving a situation and
just think about it okay so for example
let's suppose you have a big data right
and you are working with AWS software
and uh your management has shared a
certain order IDs to you and the
expectation is like based on these order
ID just compare and let me know which
product we
sold in your Excel file they could be
500,000 plus number of rows there from
the 5,000 500,000 rows you have to match
the only order ID that has
being given by the
management you have two choice either
you can put a filter or you can start
using the find option control app but
that will unnecessarily take a lot of
time so in that case v lookup is going
to help you out vup is specifically used
for the purpose of comparing two sheet
based on the common common values and
get the desired result just look at the
first case here
in this V lookup sheet I have the game
IDs I have the HS values I have the as
values and I need to find out the name
just imagine if your senior has given to
you a data and their expectation
is fill the right name in this sheet and
share to me so obviously there will be a
question where the name is how do I
compare so the names I have given to the
next sheet of it there if you just look
at there the names are
here it is not mean that you're just
going to copy and past this one here no
don't do that the right name has to be
pasted
so before using this look of
functionality there is only one thing is
mandatory to find between the sheet and
that is a common value
a common
value if you just look at there in this
vook of false there is an game ID is
here as well as a game ID is here
too I can match the game ID with this
sheet versus that sheet and then I'll
match I I'll bring the name over there
so just look at there the first game ID
is one what is the name of one one is
here and its name is called Detroit
a basic concept is do
copy and paste when the people don't
know about the look of function they do
they complete the sheet like this way
unnecessary time taken process rather
than this I would say start with V
lookup when you write this V look up
everyone you have to follow the
arguments let me explain the argument
wise this
function lookup value lookup value is a
value that always be the common between
the destination and the target
sheet what one which one is the common
one is a game ID which is here as well
as there so I'll match I want you to
look up the value of game ID comma from
which table you can come to the
reference sheet and I will say guys
select the entire column like
this select the entire column now you
you can ask me like why is why should
select the entire column the reason is
in future if you will add more data into
it so Lookout function will
automatically match the
records but if you will select the table
so don't forget to freeze it you know
why because if you're dragging it the
table will get moved so rather than this
I would go ahead with the column H to Y
I select it once I select it and I put
comma when I put comma then it
says column index number now that is
really important a column index numbers
mean the table which you have selected
which column number you wanted to see as
a result is it one or is it two your
answer will be two so you have to write
two manually then I put comma and now
two option is waiting for you one is
called true another one is called a
false true we use in the approximate
match
case approximate match case I have a
certain examples for it in this case you
have to use the exact match why exact
match because if someone's game ID is
one if he will write one then the
Detroit come if someone write 1.1 the
name will not be appear so I'm going to
use this exact match which is a false
and I close my bracket and I hit enter
and I found the result now when I do
double click to the corner of it and see
for other game ID I don't need to apply
the formula one by one when I do double
click on the corner and see all the
names appear
if you're getting confused like why it
is coming one here as the reason it is
already a name is one over there okay if
I'm going to name it like you know uh
simply learn here if I change
here and the name will get changed over
here automatic okay try your first
Formula everyone the V look of function
yes you can select it admin if you just
take your mouse there see if you just
take your mouse that the point the arrow
sign will get coming as and down you
just click and it will get selected okay
Sim me you said please explain once
again look at on the screen and you can
also see this one is equal to V look
up look up value this one comma it's
like table array I'm coming to the sheet
is is and see don't be confused with
this one it is the scroll down so look
at here you can take your mouse there
not the header I said from the h column
when you take your mouse the pointer
starts coming you can hold it select it
okay that doesn't matter edin that
doesn't matter because it is empty now
right it is empty so column number two
is getting match basically your V lookup
is matching based on row by row okay row
by row so when you select this one comma
and uh you have to be here don't switch
between the sheet just be there type two
comma and then you can take this false
bracket close and enter okay Sim me now
you can try and let me
know okay hash name is coming okay so V
reason because uh you have been
switching okay just look at that I'm
repeating once
again okay just look and observe how am
I doing this one okay W you to we look
up look up value see first of all look
at here I am in this V look of false
sheet okay I have chosen the A4 which is
uh my look of value game ID and I put
comma when I put a comma it says give me
the the table so I'm coming to the sheet
is called
references and you can see if you are
selecting only the table so please make
sure you have to press F4 so that it
should get freeze and then just be there
don't jump back to the sheet just put a
comma and write there too and see when
I'm tapping the comma here you will see
the formula is is coming is is is
written here can you see this one the
formula is written over here so don't be
confused like here where the formula is
is coming so now if I write two comma
and for
false I close my bracket and then enter
hit and you will have your
answer
clear try and answer me
now which is the purpose of fixing
here so you forget the concept of
freezing the dollar F I think so because
uh if you will not fix this one if you
not fix this one if you just do double
click on the corner your table will get
moved down okay okay let me let me show
you everyone like getting confused now
look and observe I don't know like why
you all are not applying this one
first or before and then ask me you know
what you will have more clarity to
understand see first look we look up
select it
comma references table it says and I'm
going to select the entire
table as for the argument select it
comma 2 comma zero and I hit enter I got
my answer and I do double click on it h
tell me why it is coming na a n a n a
can you answer
me prly it was not coming but now it is
coming and I'm giving you the answer why
it has
happened when you come to this reference
is look at the table address the table
address starts from
H1 to
i21 admin response me if I'm correct the
table address is H1 to I
21 if it is yes if it is yes so
everywhere in this table everywhere I'm
going I the table address has to be H1
to
i21 but just look at there can you see
the address what
happened it is coming H7 to
i27 why it
happens answer me why why it happens
here because when you are dragging it
the cell addresses keep moving and that
is the reason I said when you select
this H1 to i21 keep it
freeze keep it freeze and now if you
drag it now you will have your perfect
result hope that makes sense to you all
now okay
see I'm telling you uh guys don't get
confused with this one you know what
Excel is a very user friendly
application I'm telling you if you ask
me that aim if I'm selecting this column
E and F and I press F4 so e means entire
columns there is no row number involved
so obviously it will comes only $1 sign
before H and before I right so that is
the first exercise now you can come to
the next one okay if anyone is here who
still not yet done so I can help you
out okay so moving ahead everybody and
now this is another examples for
it if I ask you to calculate the price
so it is very simple to calculate it
right see the list of items and their
priz is given in this table it is a very
basic concept but what I'm going to do
look it's a
file I click on file and I open a new
workbook just have a
experience how to use vook up between
the workbook okay look and observe and
try after me let me show you the first
basic concept if I need to fetch the
price of the items the customers
purchase if I need to get the price here
so between this table and this table
which one is the common the common is
items there is a stock items and there
is an stock item so I'm going to use
this relookup lookup value will be this
keyboard and I put comma then it says
give me the table array table array
means the table which you
have where from where you wanted to
fetch the prize amount I select it and I
put comma it says column index number is
it one or two obviously it is two and in
exact match the name is called keyboard
so keyboard you have to mention exactly
and when I close my bracket and I hit
enter I found
250 but when I drag it down I'm getting
this na na na na you are getting
confused now now it's let's get the
clarity when I open on this look what
happened my table is keep moving with
it so in this table of selection you can
see everyone nothing is there if nothing
is there so no nothing will come here so
what will you do in this case in this
case whenever you select the table keep
it free just mark my word if you're
using V lookup you are selecting the
table make this habit you have to press
F4 so that the table get free now double
click on it and you will see the answer
is there okay first complete this one
then I'll show you between the two
workbook
here there is the
formula exercise two formula on chat Nam
which one uh the one with please ask me
in the uh beginning of the
class okay sure I
will okay and I am waiting just because
I need everyone should complete this one
okay okay now listen everyone okay if
you're still working on it so I will say
just take a pause look at on the screen
and you can try after me I just wanted
to make you confident while using V
lookup between the workbooks so I'm just
going to you know uh say control X is
the cut and I'm going to paste this one
in a new workbook just imagine if the
data is not given in the same workbook
if the information is not given the same
workbook so how will you do that work
okay so look let's suppose if you
have to f
the information from a different Excel
workbook you are here the information is
in the different workbook look your V
lookup can work easily in between the
workbook too I'm going to select this
keyboard and I put comma that says give
me the table array and I you need to
take your mouse into the taskar then
open Excel file will be visible right
and then just take your cursor over
there just click on it and now you can
select guys noted down a very important
instructions over here the instruction
is just look at this formula everybody I
cannot zoom this one I'm sorry but uh
just focus guys when you will be in
between the workbook your table
selection comes automatically free
please I didn't I don't need to press F4
when you start working now you will
observe this one okay so it is by
default coming as in freeze and I'm
going to
put comma 2 comma 0 why zero so either
you can write either you can choose
false or you can write zero both are
same I repeat either you can choose
false or you can write zero both are
same and I hit enter and that's my
answer so what does it mean it means my
V look up Works between the workbook
two have
experience all right everyone so let
it's time for the activity I'm giving
you the situation you can try and answer
me guys you can come to the exercise two
you can see we have a customer ID we
have name mobile numberers and city is a
big data you can see there lot of mobile
numbers and information is given there
now from this big table I need to know
the these mobile numbers belongs to
which
city do it and confirm it is not popping
up uh so not to worry about it like if
it is not popping up so amount maybe the
formula has been deleted okay you can
press is equal to then just multiply
quantity into price you will get the
answer not such a big deal maybe the
formula is being
deleted
correct guys this is the exercise two is
an uh activity for all bring the correct
City number city name based on these
mobiles
number obviously that will give you the
error if we close the
file no uh P listen if you your question
is like you bring the information like
say for example exercise one is here and
you are saying like if I'm going to uh
close this file this one see when you
close this file the result will be there
the result will be there don't worry
about it okay if you wanted to refresh
this one then the file has to be open
the result will be there it's not going
to get
deleted all right I'm really happy to
see that like many more people have
completed the same but maybe few of the
peoples are there who not yet done this
is the answer for you guys look at there
so uh the situation or you can say it's
a terms and condition of we
lookup we look up lookup value is the
mobile number obviously because this is
the mobile number City I am looking for
so I select this mobile M mobile number
as a lookup value and I put a comma and
it says table array where is the table
table is this one so maybe some of you
there like like a says select the table
entirely sell the table hey hold on
listen to me if you look up value start
somewhere from the middle of the table
that V lookup says your column selection
start from
there okay please note it down if your
lookup value is here and you want it to
match from the different table and the
lookup value will start from middle of
the table the table selection should be
start from that column okay it's
mandatory then I put comma 2 comma 0
because it's exact match when I hit
enter now I'm getting my answer so
everyone just remember we lookup says
your table selection should be start
from the
lookup Val
okay okay if so that is a left case and
left case your V lookup can't answer and
for that answer you have to
wait now I'm coming to next exercise
everybody so evolution is your exercise
everyone whenever you have a stare time
complete this one get the conference
based on their team option now coming to
this
exercise the next one we look up a true
statement okay let me show you something
unique
interesting okay
[Music]
so well n the answer is very simple uh
two means a column number for example
look at there in in this table it is the
player position team catches yards there
okay let's suppose if I need to know Mr
David David's uh catches so David
catches catches is coming on the column
number four so you have to write the
fourth number that is the column number
okay and second your question is like
why am I writing zero so if there is the
North and you wanted to match n so if
someone will write the spelling of n is
like n so answer should not be visible
because it is exactly not
matches
okay now coming to this one everybody
look at there I need to calculate what
is the income tax
rate if someone income is
$45,500
here is the parameter given on the right
side if someone's income is in between
this to this the tax rate will be
15% if someone's income is in between
this to this the tax will be 28% and
all so for me it is like okay look up
value is this one comma table is this
one and as I said when you select the
table don't forget to freeze it comma n
just look tax it is coming on the third
number okay third column 1 2 three so I
will have to write three there and comma
we are habitual with zero when I hit
enter it is coming n you know why
because zero means I said exact match
exact match means you can choose a false
but the question is
45,500 anywhere is exactly
mention in this
table answer me yes no the answer is no
it is not exactly mention if it is not
exactly mentioned so it's not going to
get exactly matched but if you start
counting your number from this row
27,31
302 3 4 so till this
58,500 so I'm sure this number will be
somewhere in
between
so it means it is just like a slab rate
if your income is in between this to
this your answer will be
31% so considering such kind of cases
where the exact numbers are not
mentioned but if if it is in between
then we look up says use me that is a
true you can close the bracket enter h
and see you CAU your 31 % okay and look
if I'm just going to write
$110 it's coming 15% why because it is
in between this okay and you know what
you can Define true as in one false as
in
zero complet it now all right so I got
some responses that that's great hey
everybody now help me out come to the
next exercise
okay hey everyone I have given the
parameter is there like if your score
your average score is in between 0 to 45
bring the Grade B 45 to 60 bring the
grade C 60 to 75 bring the Grade B if
your average is 75 above your grade will
be a why don't you just get it done with
the help of we look up and confirmed me
I'm sure now you guys you can all do
this part I'm
sure uh Nam look at there this is the
average score of the students you need
to get the grade based on their score
simple
okay okay really appreciate to see
people just you guys are responding
there can you just help me out guys is
it a case of zero or is it case of
one that's the spirit I really like it
that's great it means now you guys have
the clarity in the look of when and
where we have to use zero when and where
we have to use one m i
right okay this is for for the people
who not yet done we look up look up
value is average comma come to the table
keep it freeze comma grade is coming on
two comma and don't use zero why because
it's a slab 0 to 45 45 to 60 60 to 75
there can be n number in between so it
is one close the bracket let the V look
up helps oh okay oh I by Miss C so let
the V lookup helps you to get the
right result okay come on this is for
people who not yet done quickly do
that all right all right everyone so one
more exercise for you all come to the
next one and without my explanation
bring the commission now go ahead and
get it
done only Capital
lers why not it is not Cas sensitive V
okay really really appreciate uh for
your response everyone and I'm really
happy to see like yes I hope so I have
add on the clarity of this formula I
tried to make this functions clear maybe
you already knows these ones okay but
maybe uh you know I made the things
clear to how to use we look up when and
where we have to use one when and where
use that Z okay uh this is for you this
is for for for that person who still you
know not yet get done but this is just
for you okay so vook up is based on the
sales and comma and I'm going to keep it
the selected table comma zero uh comma
two and it's not zero because it's
a approximate match case and I do double
click on the corner I have the answer
wow you know what if everyone till this
moment what we have faced we have we we
Face a some small type of a queries
there okay small queries but you know
what these queries these way of
explanation helps you to understand the
vook up function but it is now time to
discuss the real the exact vook up
function to be used okay so see I once
we will complete this then we will go
for a break okay otherwise there will be
no break okay it's very going to be very
easy for you all don't wor so I'm coming
on the sheet a sheet B sheet C and Sheet
d a four sheet is there for you there's
an order ID and it's not a small order
ID you can see it's a huge order ID
there now the the management expectation
okay let me Zoom it up
my management has shared to me this uh
you know uh this one the this order ID
and says like aim do one thing bring
match the product name and category name
and share this report as soon as
possible I'm like okay boss so um the
supporting file is here is the B and the
C and the D so every time I do one thing
always whenever I get a new
data first I open the file and I start
doing
the you know uh analysis he where is my
matching value so for example I need to
see the product name so question is like
where is the product name is it on the
sheet B answer is no is it on the sheet
C answer is yes it is here but then
I get a let shocked here the shock
is the product name is based on the
product ID correct it is the time to
understand this application okay
everyone this this formula not
application the formula because I will
help you to get the product name here
you guys have to get the category name
by
yourself it's a
deal y
guys it's a deal just say
yes that's great okay just focus here
maybe I'll give you some a new idea here
so everyone when I'm coming to the sheet
see I found that uh you know the product
name is there but the problem is the
common value is missing the product ID
is not there sorry the order ID is not
there so what you do because it's not
common so we lookup will not work then I
got an idea if anyhow you know I will
match my order ID
to my product
ID product ID and then through the
product ID I'll get my
pru name because without having the
product ID is impossible
to get the product name so I wanted to
know against this order ID which product
has been
sold If the product name is not there so
I'm I guaranteed the product ID will be
there because if you just observe in the
uh
Supermarket you know if you just observe
Supermarket when you buy the products so
the that in you know the billing counter
guys will always scan the product
scan the produ when it's scanning now it
is scanning the ID basically so in every
type of software that keeping the record
maybe the name of the product is not
there but they will always keep the
record the product has been sold based
on these IDs so that information is
given on the sheet B order ID product ID
unit price quantity and everything is
there fine so I got the solution like
okay okay the product ID is here so
let's match the order ID to the product
ID and then we'll get the product name
so I'm going to use a v lookup lookup
value is this one comma it says where is
the table for product ID and I'm like
come to the sheet B and as I told you
guys I always select the entire
column okay so when I select the entire
column from B to f comma and I'm going
to write two because product ID is
coming on the second column I just type
there two comma zero when I hit
enter okay it is coming 11 11 is word 11
is my product ID when I have a product
ID now I can easily use V lookup lookup
value the product ID come to the sheet
C select the table
comma 2 comma Z oh wow I get my name am
I get I uh I I get my name here this is
what you may if of you are doing it you
get the V from the V look up you get the
one value in one column and based on it
then you start writing another V look up
in another column of it hey everyone no
don't do that just come and observe a
con a concept here
it's 11 I just double click so this
formula
open hey everyone if I'm going to write
one more vook up here I just write one
more vook up can I treat this existing
vook up as an lookoff value just say yes
no can I treat this one as a lookoff
value this about the concept okay can I
treat this one as a lookup value if I
can if you are saying yes so you can
just put a comma then it says give me
the table array and where is the table
is on the sheet C I'm going to select
the entire table comma 2 comma 0 bracket
close
enter how about this way are getting the
product name
everyone not only one but you can use a
two we look up together it's all about
the
concept okay try now but don't try the V
look up V look up two times first get
the V look up first the product ID and
then try the another
one start now
everyone so guys not only get the
product name as remember the deal you
have to get the category name too
okay got the product ID but it's
confused to getting the name okay don't
confuse KY just look at it this is the
same your answer
correct okay just do double click on it
and just click your cursor before this V
look up and type one more what's a big
deal and then this one is coming now as
a look of value and I put comma and
where is the table when you just put a
comma table table is on the sheet C and
what you can do you can select it all
comma 2 comma
zero right enter and you will have your
product
name
clear okay that's good I hope the
category name is also done
P Deeper
wonder how many V lookups are
required use two wonderful can I use
three V
lookup just imagine if you don't have
the product name can I use the 3v
lookup see if you are selecting the
taable Simi I will say if you're
selecting the table make sure you have
to freeze it
otherwise I would say try
to that's why I I said now you just take
your mouse on the column A the name of
the column c d wherever you will take
your mouse your arrow there's a down
arrow symbol comes and click and select
yes that what I'm what I'm that what
exactly I'm trying to EXL from the
beginning of this V look up look V look
up order ID comma when I'm the sheet B
look don't be here can you see this
one response me can you see this one
click and hold your left mouse key and
drag it towards the right so B to F will
get selected and then comma 2 comma zero
and enter
okay okay okay
well I think let me complete this one
guys because I'm getting a less
responses here but first of all really
appreciate for people who have done this
one okay guys whenever you got uh
multiple files there you have to fetch
the records based on their matching
values trust me this concept is going to
help you a lot okay so uh look at there
so I am looking for the category name
category name name and category name is
there and category name will be based on
category ID and where is the category ID
category ID is available in the column e
in the sheet C so to get the category ID
either we have we should have a supplier
ID a product name or product ID so right
now I have a product name okay so what I
can do I can start with this we look up
product name comma
sheet C and start selecting from product
I told you the concept if you remember
that okay select this entire
table comma and category ID is coming on
one 2 three the third number comma zero
enter so this four is what it is your
category ID when you have the category
ID so why not let's use this V lookup
so this one is now coming as an lookup
value and I put comma that says give me
the table array where is the table table
is on the sheet D and I'm going to
select it all comma 2 comma 0 Y 2
category name when I hit enter and
that's my daily product okay those who
have not yet done take two minutes and
complete this one so that we can move
forward so nothing try to memorize okay
it is all about the concept everyone
those who have not yet done this is for
you completed and confirmed me in the
chat window and those who are maybe uh
you know getting this training through
the mobile app and all I was simply
advised you uh you can take a screenshot
of these formulas so that you know later
on you can complete this one
okay because I know everyone while
watching everything is seems to be very
easy but when you start exactly applying
it now you will get a start so do it
have a practical experience so that you
will have the complete
Clarity all right everyone that's great
so here we just completed our lookup
functionality fine and now if I'm coming
to this one this is your homework okay
this will be your homework and now we
will start discussing about your the
next Formula that is the H look up so
everyone I told you the V lookup
function we use specifically in the case
when we have a vertical database and H
look up we use when we have a data but
that is in the horizontal order just
look at this database a Salesman name is
not entered like this the salesman name
is being entered like this way the
salesman their April sale their May sale
June July and all so this is called the
horizontal entry database let's suppose
if I need to know Mr Manoj Patra this is
the name Mano Patra and don't worry
about this drop- down list very soon
I'll explain the data validation chapter
so where I'll help you to create a list
like
this uh I need to know Mr Manoj patra's
July month still and it is really easy
just look at there don't use V lookup
have to use H lookup hookup lookup value
is Mr Manoj
Patra comma table don't select
vertically select horizont ly and keep
it freeze by pressing
F4 comma it says give me the row index
number hey everyone in the column in the
v lookup it was column index number but
when I come to the H lookup it is starts
coming as an row index number so if I'm
looking for the July month data it means
row number one 2 3 4 5 July is coming on
on fifth row I just write there 5 comma
0 and enter that's the value
230,000 458 or 23,48119
hey everybody now let me give you a task
perform and answer me look at this table
everyone we have a date region sales
representative and all and guys I have
given the parameter on the right side to
calculate the commission hey everyone
you just tell me if someone's sale is
4,190 46 as for this parameter what will
be his Commission
note it down I'm not asking for the
percentage I'm asking for the exact
commission amount calculate and only
answer me the first of it okay what will
be the commission if someone sale is
41904
try well you not you not listen to me
properly everyone I said I don't want to
see the
7% 7% is no doubt it's a right answer
but I need the exact that amount
okay
yeah and I really appreciate this
2903 is the answer someone is coming and
and that is an absolutely right answer
I'm telling you guys and just this is
for those people who not yet done is
equal to H lookup you know why am I
using hookup I'm sure you know why so H
look up comma select it keep it free
comma 2 comma 1 obviously not zero
because it's again is coming as a slab
rate of when I get the 7% so what if it
is coming 7% I'm going to keep it as a
number format first and then this 7%
will get multiply with the cell and
enter hit and now that's the answer okay
now complete and confirmed in the chat
window
well even if it is coming as in
percentage please try to focus here
change it into the number format okay
change it into the number
format okay so there is a Formula
quickly complete this one and guys if
anyone is here we still working
on well you can handle then if as error
ashba very simple you know now like I
told you this formula if error you can
simply write this got
it you can see that like if it is coming
uh see like this you can handle this way
like if error after using this Ed look
up if it is coming like this so show me
result like nil okay and I hit enter and
look what
happened and if I'm going down
I'm sure somewhere will be oh yes clear
to you wonderful but that's a really
good
question okay so performance is your
homework everyone you have to deal with
this one sheet two sheet and three sheet
and I just want to hint to you everyone
this is your complete one week of
homework I'm giving to you this
performance sheet performance report is
the question based on V look up plus h
look up okay you have to get the
NorthEast Southwest wise their
performance their performance report
which is here you can consider one two
three sheet and you will get your answer
you can try in this upcoming week when
we meet in the next class so if you not
get done so I will help you out
okay wow now I'm moving forward
everybody and look
I'm coming to this concept as I told you
guys U you know like there there there
can be many more people here in my in
this Workshop maybe they are using the V
lookup using the V lookup but there is
only one problem the problem
is if they wants to know based on the
dates of product ID salesperson region
and total if I need to get the all four
values so we are using we look up in
every single column of it and if I ask
you why because of the column numbers
are different for every column am I
right everyone just say yes
no because now I'm just going to give
you an idea where you going to use one V
look up and you your your you know your
result will come automatically just get
it done I'm going to going to going to
to zoom this one little so that it will
be more visible hey
everybody it is very simple in Microsoft
Excel if you wanted to know the column
number should comes
automatically
okay and it is to get this one you just
need to learn a formula
which we call a match function match
says give me the look of value I am
taking I'm selecting the product ID
because I wanted to know what is the
column index number of product
ID so when I select this product ID
comma and it says give me the array
array means area and I wanted to match
only from the header side
okay only from the header side and keep
it
freeze once you freeze this one the last
argument of match is exact match which
is zero and I close my bracket and I hit
enter that two is coming
what a two is nothing but is a column
index number and look at here everyone
see if I drag it towards the right side
look
you can cross check guys and answer me
salesperson's column index number is
what is it coming correct or not just
cross check now this is simple because
your respones highly matters for me so
look I have just used a one formula that
helps me to get this uh you know column
index number easily to come okay so if I
can use so just try first everyone get
this match function done just get it
done then I'll show you how am I going
to utilize this one with v look
up
guys just do apply this match function
okay get the clarity how this match
function is using here and then I'll
explain how you can utilize this one in
V
lookup okay now let me show you so you
asking me for repeat join late huh okay
just look at this one you start with
this match function product ID is a
lookup value then just select only the
header only the header and keep it
freeze comma zero so that match and tell
you that product ID is the column number
two and if I drag it and see it's coming
437 okay everyone just look how will you
U ize this one this formula okay look we
look
up look of value is the date
comma where is the table table is this
one okay I select the entire table and
I'm keeping it freeze okay and I freeze
it so this is simple we look up till
this
moment and now it says give me the C
column index number hey everybody I
don't want to go and count the column
index number
manually because I know a formula and
that is called a
match match will get match with this
one this one just because of I I keep it
in Zoom so that's why it's not appearing
but I'm sure you can see that K1 I have
selected comma and the area you have to
only select the head
and comma zero so this zero for match
comma and this zero for we look up and I
hit
enter and that's my answer and if you
remember that
everybody this is the row or the
column answer me let me see how many of
you remember
that I repeat everyone this is the
selected area are treated as in column
or row very good and this one is the
column so look and observe if you
remember that
concept
J2 so I need to freeze what a column K1
I will freeze the row you know better
the concept okay I hit enter I look at
the benefit everyone one formula I only
try drag and drop and I got my all
answer
that is called the powerful V looka plus
match
function okay just try now everyone go
ahead if anyone is there who wants me to
repeat this one you can simply let me
know I will repeat this formula
again okay so look at here let
me okay
we lookup lookup value is date
comma and the table you can select the
entire table keep it freeze so that is
your V lookup correct the lookup value
and the table array fine now it says
column index number that is important so
I don't want to count the column index
number manually I'm going to use this
formula is called match so I will match
the K1 I just press up Arrow key it's
being selected comma and match remember
I only said select the header part
correct comma zero so this one will get
matched as a row number sorry as in
column number and this one will this
zero is for V lookup once you write this
formula then just put a dollar sign
before
J and between k
and one simple and enter hit and
look
drag
and
drop okay try
now if you want me to explain the
concept of adding columns number you
must have to go back to the sheet is
called mix cell
references just once go back here
and think about it like what I said if
you remember that I told you this
concept I told everyone this concept if
you remember that when you have to put
dollar sign if you are selecting from
the column and from the row that what
exactly concept I have applied over
there if you just closely observe this
one you will get the idea
match is a function I see match function
if you ask me when we use so there can
be a several answers for it match is
itself a formula the name of the match
is match function brings you the exact
position of the value you are trying to
get match but it's is up to you how you
are utilizing this one just like I am
utilizing that exact position number as
an column index number here
okay okay how to drag and drop
WBO
see you cannot drag it in one you have
to drag it here release your mouse then
drag it down okay you can't drag it one
you know like in one time go first
horizontal or vertical and then go the
opposite one how I freeze the table
array don't you remember the shortcut
key is called F4 FN key plus F4 anyone
is here who is still working on so I'll
wait or otherwise I need to explain one
last functions to you and that is called
the indexing
here you're done but you're not able to
drag
okay uh enter hit when you hold your
mouse to the corner of it it will get
drag and
drop okay so moving forward everybody
and look I'm just trying to this
analysis part making try you know more
easy for you to understand see right now
we discuss about this V lookup plus the
combination of match function trust me
guys if you not clear with this just do
one or more more than one time practice
and once you implement this one this
concept helps you a lot to dragging and
dropping the information between the
files okay there is one more concept
just learn everyone and that is called a
naming range look and observe how this
naming range is going to help you out in
this formula okay it's going to be very
interesting see first of all understand
what is this naming range naming range
means a range which I named it like for
example it is like 1 2 3 four five six
and I'm going to select it okay I just
select it all and then see I have
selected all and then I will click here
everyone look at here this is the
one this is called the name box okay
this one is called the name box this one
this is called the name box and this one
is called a formula bar okay a formula
bar so don't be confused with this one
right so now when I type this and I
select it and I click here I just click
over there and I just name it like a b c
and I hit enter so what I have named it
a b c and enter so now if I need to get
the total of it so when I write the
formula sum I don't need to select it
okay I just type there a b and c that's
starts up here and I close my bracket
and I hit enter wow I'm getting 21 but
the question is like aim if it is
already on we are already on the same
sheet then why this ABC is there like we
can easily select it now then why ABC
and I'm like sir there is a benefit of
it just look for example I am going
to the beginning of the sheet here is
the first sheet and now I need to get
the total of the same numbers now the
problem starts
you are going to face difficulties to
jump on that desired sheet isn't
it then what will you do if you define
the naming range you don't even need to
go there the name is appearing here okay
and you can just close the bracket and I
hit enter and you will have your answer
let me show you one second is equal to
like some a
[Music]
c and I close and I hit enter but why is
not coming one
second it's like
multiple name is like something else
because ABC is already there I think so
a b c d e that's the name I have defined
basically the name is already there now
that's why it is not coming but not to
worry I'm just going to rename it a b c
d e a different name I just
assigned ABC 1 2 3
information a random name I've given is
like information okay and now if I'm
trying to get this one sum sum of
ination and I hit enter that's coming
and now I'm just going to another sheet
of
it and let me try is equal to sum sum of
what information hey everyone just look
it is starts coming now and I hit enter
so the benefit is I don't need to go
there and select the range if I Define
the naming range so I can easily get the
calculation done right how did I how I
did that I just select the range of it
and here you can type any name so
question is like the concept of learning
this how it's going to help me out here
everyone there is an next sheet is there
it is just an exercise for you all
we have data 2 and we look up plusma
means I need to know based on these name
I need to know what are the values in
this
table so I know like I will use V lookup
plus match
clear
so I'm going to do one thing see if I'm
using V lookup what is required is
required to select the entire table in V
lookup table array means select the
entire table so I just select it and I'm
just going to name it like uh my data a
random name I have given what I have
done first I select the entire table of
the sheet data to and I named it my data
correct and now if I'm using match
function so I'll come and I'll have to
select the only header because match
function says select the header and now
I'm just going to name it like my header
I just random two name I have defined
okay hey everybody now I'm coming back
here and I'll show you one more way of
getting the
answer without
even there going there to the sheet look
we look up look up value this one one
comma guys for table array what should I
do should I go and select
or at least spons
me my data exactly exactly look that is
the benefit comma column index number
I'm going to use match look up value is
B1 comma it says array so I'm going to
say my header comma zero and then comma
zero once you get the answer you please
share your experience like how about
this concept now I need to freeze one
side column and one side
row and I hit enter everybody and look
at them
drag and draw how about this concept
it's easy I don't need to jump between
the sheet and becomes so easy for me to
get my
answer okay you wish you can utilize
this one quickly
now W before using this V look up in
this data to select the entire table and
name it like my data and only select the
header and name it like my header okay
once you define the header name and the
table name then come back to we look up
and use this formula
that's great guys keep updating me once
you have done with
this uh n do not try to name it with a
space bar do not try to use uh any
special character do not write the name
with the numbers starts or end
okay all right everybody body so let's
move forward so now I'm coming to the
last part of it and that is like you
know how to get the data coming from the
left side I will say everyone you just
come to this one this exercise very uh
know accurate example for you to
understand why indexing
is is required to learn here okay look
at there on the
screen I'm just going to increase a
little size of it I will Zoom this one
later on but before this I will say
everyone come and understand this table
okay basically this data is for the
expenditure expenditure database okay
here is an expenses name you can see
housing grosser car payment insurance
home phone and all here is a Jan Fab
March then the total of quarter one
April May June and then second quarter
total similar like third quarter and
fourth quarter this is the one year of
expenses information is there if I'm
giving the presentation of this date
based on this database if my management
says Ain tell me what is the code of the
grocery what it what it second quarter
total third quarter total and fourth
quarter total see getting second quarter
third quarter and fourth quarter easy to
get it done why because expense is given
here you can see expenses is given here
and the quarters are coming to the right
side of it okay it's very easy to get it
done but the problem starts for code
code exactly coming to the left side of
it and we look up says I'm not going to
bring you the data from the left side
then what to do in that case you should
try you should learn a formula is called
index
index index function says give me the
array array means just select the entire
table I repeat just select the entire
table half of the job is done now comma
it's asking me about the the row number
hey everyone remember the row number we
are counting like this way 1 2 3 four
just like an H look up so you tell me
guys should I go and count the row
number manually or do you know any
formula for it that exactly tell you the
number of grocery
is this is the row number of the grocery
do you know any
formula yes an absolutely right answer
that is called a match function match
grocery area of grocery starts from here
to the end of it keep it freeze comma
zero comma zero
okay so and I close my bracket hey
everyone this is the way you get your
row number it says what about the column
number so I'm looking for
codee so why should I count the code
column number again if I know it's
better to use match code is this H start
from here to the end of it only the
header
okay keep it freeze comma zero bracket
close for match bracket close for index
hey everyone look at the intersection of
it and see how easily you got your
answer now that's called the index
function okay try everybody
now yep so if anyone is there who wants
me to repeat this formula
guys you can simply ask me okay I will
explain that one or just try to get it
done one side match for row another side
match for column
simple all right all right everybody
like uh still working on should I
wait okay so someone says please repeat
okay look at on the screen is equal to
index select the entire table first
press F4 comma match function says bring
the row number of grocery so I
select this is the area where all the
expenses exist keep it freeze comma Z
bracket close this is for match match
for row again I'm going to write match
and I'm going to select code and code is
going to get match
starts from here to the headers Parts
only keep it freeze comma
zero
okay ranti if it is okay for you so
completed and confirmed me in the chat
window quickly
now or if you're still working on I'll
wait otherwise let's jump into the next
topic because the formula is now here
it's
completed just overloaded with the
formulas okay but what I can say now Sim
me because
uh I come I came here with the lots of
example just because you know you guys
will have more clarity in me
okay all right everyone that's great so
here we done with this index and match
functions okay rest of the sheet is for
your exercise purpose okay whenever you
have a spare time do apply all these
formulas and functions over here and get
the things clear right and now let's
start discussing about a next thing into
it and that is called conditional
formatting okay what is this and why we
need to learn this one it is highly uh
required when you have a data and you
wanted to show them in color just for
the reminders and all let's suppose for
example customer name is there and and I
have a sales amount and profit is is
there so find uh the question is very
simple I need to see the profit those
profit here that having the value which
is above of 300 that has to be in the
red color The
Profit amount from the
customers which is above
$300 I need that has to be in the green
color so if you are going to do it in a
manual way just like select this one
this one this one this one and this one
and you just comeing here and applying
the colors so the colors is getting
applied but the problem is in future if
this number is getting changed just like
230 this one
Still In Color which is wrong I need
that my table that has to be in the
automated way of it got it so what to do
look to do that you can select your
numbers The Profit
columns inside the Home tab you will get
an option is called conditional
formatting click on it and come to this
highlight cell rules when it come to the
Highlight cell rules there will be
certain options are given I'll start
with the greater than
click and look my first condition what
numbers will be in uh a green color the
value which is above
of uh 300 so if I just right there 300
and
automatically all the sales having a
300 above values is getting color you
wanted to apply different colors you can
just click over here and see
look you can change the color and you
wanted to apply the customized color you
can come to the last option which is
called the custom
format in the custom format you can come
to the font and the fill to apply a
color just like I choose the background
colors from Phil coming to font and I
choose a font color as in white and I
clicked on okay and see now that's my
True Result starts coming and the
benefit is that like in future if any
value comes under the True
Value look that starts coming into color
if any values goes down by 300 that
starts coming into the green color sorry
the colors has been disappear so that is
the reason we are learning conditional
formatting it is always giving you the
color when the value gets matched with
the
condition just like I select this column
again okay and uh I wanted to know if
the value is in between
100 to $300 in between I need to show
that one in the yellow color so I'll
come back to conditional formatting
again highlight sell rules and I'm going
to use this one that is a between option
I click it is like
100 it is like 200 when I write this now
the values are coming or not 200 300
sorry the numbers are coming into colors
but I need that yellow color so I click
on custom
format and
uh click on fill choose color and apply
this that is there now one more
condition I would like to apply if any
values goes down by $100 that has to be
in the red color so I'll come back to
this highlight cell rules and click on
less than so all options are here the
only thing is required to know how to
utilize this one I click on this less
than and I'm going to write 100 but
nothing is visible because there is no
numbers less than 100 so not to worry
I'll click on custom format choose the
color and I apply this
and now let's just cross $70 that's
coming into the red color so the overall
point of discussion is that everyone you
can apply click on conditional
formatting click on manage rules the
last one you can see the three
conditions I have applied you can apply
more than one condition in the same
column and anytime any condition you can
edit you can delete or you can click a
new rule op it's good go ahead everybody
and apply the
SC well
uh you can select it come to conditional
formatting click on highlight cell rules
choose the greater than write the
numbers like 300 and click here choose
custom format and apply your own color
into it simple click on okay and okay so
this is the way you can
apply conditions so I have applied three
conditions there okay just like uh let
me delete this one one is greater than
300 so green colors between 100 to 300
yellow and less than 100 so red okay you
can try one by one three options is
there in the conditional formatting and
once you have get that one cross check
and confirm to
which one to choose in conditional
formatting which one is the column are
you talking about web you can clearly
see that I have selected the profit
one profit
column I am on the condition forting
exercise one you can
see okay highlight sell rules the first
V it will not identify until you have
not selected the column it is the first
the first condition is that if you wants
to apply condition formatting you must
have to be sure that your area has been
selected
okay keep selected this one and then try
all right everyone one more condition is
for you just look at there everybody how
easy it is to identify the top five or
top bottom five numbers in this selected
area if you know the condition
formatting in your report it always be
easy to highlight the top five and
bottom file I can come to this Home tab
click on conditional formatting and look
at the second out option which is top
and bottom Rule and I'm going to click
on this top 10 items and not 10 I'm
looking for only the
five and the top one has to be in the
green color just like okay and similarly
what are the you know the less number in
this one I can use the bottom 10 items
so I'm just going to write the five
chose
color and click okay now okay everybody
look how easy you highlight your top
five and bottom five here try this one
too all
right is there a formula to do some
based on colors on the cell I think the
answer is of your question is the same
yes there is a formula is called
sum but that will be utilized in the
options called new rule okay all right

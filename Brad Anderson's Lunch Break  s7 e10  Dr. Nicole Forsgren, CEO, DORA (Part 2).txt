- [Brad] It's lunchtime, and this is
Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
(jaunty music)
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus,
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Wherever I can, I try to take advantage
of both of these things,
and grab lunch with some
of the tech industry's best and brightest.
(jaunty music)
Today, I'll finish talking
with Dr. Nicole Forsgren,
the CEO and Chief Scientist at DORA.
In your experience
consulting with companies,
is the issue in terms of
getting more diversity
inside an organization,
is it a pipeline problem
or a workplace problem?
Do they research on that?
- Do you wanna hear this answer?
- Yeah.
- It's not a fun answer.
- Let's have it.
- Hey camera, it's not a pipeline problem.
We suck at this.
- As an industry.
- They're gonna edit this out.
As a whole industry, it's
not a pipeline problem,
since the 80's, we have half
the number of women in tech,
or half the proportion--
- As a percentage.
- As a percentage.
We suck at this.
- Yep, and you take a look now in college,
we take a look at the who's coming out,
and we still don't have the
representation that we want.
- We have more women--
- in the universities.
- Graduating from college
than we had before.
- Correct.
- We have more women
graduating in tech than we had before.
And yet 10 years post graduation,
we have women leaving in droves.
- So what's the biggest thing
that we can do as leaders
in the industry to stop this?
- Well then not just as
leaders, as peers, right?
- Fair, it's a great point.
- I hesitate just a bit
to answer and many times if you ask women,
so many of us will hesitate to answer
because we don't wanna be the
representatives for women.
- I got the idea.
- So I'll do my best
right now, and this isn't
my area of expertise
as a researcher, as a PhD,
but so much of the research
points to the fact that
the culture sucks, right?
That's the challenge.
I would encourage anyone
who's listening or watching
Google it, how can I be an ally?
- Yeah.
- How can I be an ally
to women in tech, to under
represented groups in tech,
one of the biggest things that
has hit my radar recently,
there's a difference
between having a mentor
and having a sponsor.
- Correct, very different.
- Right?
- Yeah.
- So find someone and be a sponsor.
- Yeah, totally.
- That can be huge, stand up for someone,
if someone,
asks for something or says something,
don't dismiss it because
asking for something
or saying something, takes
incredible amount of--
- Courage.
- Courage, it really does.
- I think you know your
point about really,
no matter who you are,
looking at the culture
and is the culture inclusive, and--
- I love that you, I
don't wanna interrupt,
but I'm going to because I
love that you used that word.
Because there's diverse
and there's inclusive,
and they're different things.
- And I think an inclusive environment
then breeds more diversity.
- Yes, absolutely.
- So it's one of the
things, and I'll tell ya,
we focus on this a lot
because you have introverts,
you have extroverts, you have people
who have got 20 years of
experience, somebody just out
of college, that's diversity
I wanna have on my team.
You have to have an inclusive environment
that understands, embraces,
and accentuates and listens
to all points of view.
- Yes, and that's important and I like,
I'm gonna call a little bit of
bull (beep) right now right?
Diversity of thought and
diversity of background
is super important, right?
So, don't just hire everybody
outta the same university,
and have diversity of
educational experiences,
diversity of background,
diversity of everything,
but don't use that as your excuse.
Don't be like, oh, we
have our own special brand
of diversity.
Yes, I'm sure you do, keep trying harder.
Keep doing more.
- [Brad] It's constant, it's continuous.
- If you wanna be like,
super capitalistic about it,
we find so much research
everywhere showing that
diversity of background,
diversity of thought,
diversity of gender, diversity of race,
diversity of all the things,
leads to better outcomes.
- Oh, absolutely.
- Customer satisfaction,
profit, revenue, all the things.
You make better products,
you build better software,
you get better outcomes.
It's worth the investment.
- So you go back to 10 years ago,
when someone's getting ready
to be made a vice president,
there was this
psychoanalysis that went on,
there would be this big
book delivered on everybody
that was being considered
to be vice president.
My feedback was Brad doesn't use conflict.
What do you mean I don't use conflict?
- Oh interesting.
- Yeah.
And it was interesting, I actually had one
of my direct reports,
I asked him about it,
I said, will you help me understand this?
What it came down to is I would race
to try to get alignment to
move on to the next problem,
rather than letting the
room ruminate longer
on a problem, and let conflict
exist in the room longer.
That was one of the
biggest learnings I had
in my career was how to let that happen.
'Cause you get a better outcome,
because there's more
discussion, there's more debate,
and you get a more refined answer.
- Okay, I'm gonna circle this back.
Because you know what?
Conflict, "conflict",
everyone thinks conflict's
such a dirty word.
- Correct, it has
a connotation, but does not mean that.
- That's the value of diversity.
- That's a great way--
- That's where--
- To say it.
It's been fun to drive around,
we gotta make sure we do this again.
- We should.
Thanks so much.
- Thanks so much Nicole.
It's been great.
See ya the next time.
Next time, on Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
So what's with all the nerve racking,
a big keynote, or testifying
in front of the Senate?
- [John] Probably the Senate.
- That's what I would think too.
- When you're 15 feet
from Hillary Clinton.
- Under oath.
- Ted Kennedy, it's, it can
be somewhat overwhelming.

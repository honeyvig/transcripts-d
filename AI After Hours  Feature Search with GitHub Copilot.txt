okay Erin one more time are you sure you
can do this you're confident right you
know what the menu item is called yes I
have a secret
weapon okay what's your secret weapon
well I am currently searching through
menus to see which one has the Vibes I'm
looking
for yeah not good Aron the secret weapon
you no no no no welcome to after hours
with the visual studio team and today
we're going to show upcoming
improvements to feature search in Visual
Studio it takes your search query and
uses GitHub co-pilot to elaborate on
instructions help you find settings and
more because we as developers all know
the visual studio is quite powerful and
sometimes you just forget what a menu
item is called uh new capabilities get
added to new versions and there's always
maybe a better way uh to complete a task
in visual studio right well with this
being feature search which is already an
empty text box sometimes text boxes that
you don't know how to use or aren't
giving the results you're looking for
can be a little bit intimidating yeah
absolutely like do I talk to it in full
sentences do I type keywords like I
usually do of control q and expect
co-pilot to make sense of it like do I
go straight to the AI to help me find
what I'm looking for in Visual Studio um
how is this better than feature search
itself these are all things I need to
figure out all good question so let's
explore the experience and the
engineering behind the upcoming
improvements we're making to feature
search in Visual Studio I'm Leah and I'm
a product manager for search in Visual
Studio I'm Ain a product manager working
on get a co-pilot in visual
studio and I'm Sandy I'm a developer who
works on search in Visual
Studio here I am in Visual Studio I'm
going to go ahead and hit the search
button up here that's going to bring up
feature search which can also be summon
with control Q this has been around for
a while you may be familiar with it you
can type something like I want to see
all of my breakpoints so you type the
breakpoint window and there it is hit
enter there your break points wonderful
uh but we know that sometimes users
don't know the name of the thing that
they're looking for especially newer
users they might bring up feature search
and they might type something like uh I
want to change my short Cuts so let's
edit
shortcuts but the responses that come
back aren't really what the user is
looking for it's a bunch of you know
commands shortcuts that exists under the
edit menu so we're going to try this new
button that has shown up under their
search we're going to click ask
co-pilot and that same query that the
user types is being sent to co-pilot
chat and co-pilot chat is going to
respond and give actually a pretty
accurate response about exactly where to
go go to tools options find the keyboard
section of the options dialogue it's
described quite thoroughly knows about
the assign button uh it even offers
follow-up questions so actually a really
useful way to ask questions without
having to leave the IDE um you know
these are nuanced
questions um another similar sort of
scenario would be maybe you've come from
you know net core and you're used to
doing stuff on the command line and you
don't actually know how to do a nougat
ReStore in the IDE maybe it's one of
these things you could click it and
explore
or you could go ahead and you could just
ask
co-pilot same thing send it straight to
the chat wait a little bit and
co-pilot's going to respond and let us
know that you can just right click on
the solution and that there's a restore
n packages option uh it also tells you
other ways that you can achieve the same
functionality even talks about using the
package Manor console if that's sort of
a way that you like to
develop historically co-pilots you know
mostly known about kind of
long-established features in Visual
Studio but you know we're adding things
all the time and so you know we've
updated co-pilot to be able to
understand about newer features coming
into the IDE so for example if you are a
um uh user who has you've seen on blogs
or on Twitter or something about rainbow
colored parentheses seems really cool so
you come into the chat or you come into
the feature ser search and you type
rainbow pns and there's nothing useful
here that's because you don't know what
it's actually called again you ask
co-pilot send the question to chat wait
for its response and all of a sudden it
says yeah yeah you can totally turn on
Rainbow parenthesis but in Visual Studio
we call that brace bear colorization
says go to tools options go to General
under the editor and Bam enable brace
bear
colorization so that is um
co-pilot chat integrated with feature
search hope you enjoy it so I know that
when I watch any demo as a developer I
have to wonder how do I know that this
AI works well for my situation or that
it can be trusted to provide answers
that aren't going to confuse me more uh
so I'm curious um what have we done
to the future search in visual studio
with get up co-pilot that's different
from a web search and different from
other
AIS yeah definitely one thing that's uh
different from online search engines is
that with online search engines there's
a much broader scope of things that it's
looking at so if you're trying to search
for something that's a feature in Visual
Studio it's really easy to come across
results that are actually about Visual
Studio code instead because it's the
similar naming scheme and there's even
confusions with people online who don't
know the difference between the two
products so the answers that you get
from places like stock overflow or
elsewhere might not be entirely accurate
and there's also a lot of out ofd
information online which we don't have
in the model as much because we're able
to provide it with upto-date information
about what are the features that are
currently available in the version of
Visual Studio that you're currently
using yeah and because of that uh
additional knowledge it knows more about
the newer features that the other models
and other uh AI models doesn't know
about because it's trained on much older
data and doesn't have that direct access
to the information that we
have I thought it was really interesting
that you've
mentioned up to-date and specific
information that you've added to the ask
co-pilot feature in visual studio uh
because I can relate to out-of-date
information and settings or feature
names changing so could you talk about
exactly what it is we've added um to
bring this upto-date awareness to get up
Co
pallet yeah well I think a lot of Visual
Studio users are are pretty used to
being able to uh navigate to settings uh
commands new features what's new all
those sorts of things uh using the
control Q feature search that we've had
for a long time um and so what's going
on here is we've got an integration
between that existing feature search uh
and co-pilot chat where if you are in
control q and you're not finding what
you're looking for now you've got a
button to take you to co-pilot chat to
have a more nuanced discussion and then
on the chat side uh we're able to pull
in all of that stuff that Visual Studio
already knows about itself uh and make
that context available instead of um you
know as Leah mentioned when you're
talking to chat GPT or another
uh AI it's trained on older data because
training is an expensive thing usually
the models are fairly out of date so you
might get really great information for
things that have been in Visual Studio
forever but you might not be able to get
good answers about the latest and
greatest and so that's where bringing in
the information from feature search
helps you better find Niche features new
features uh things like that and um yeah
you get a little more um uh you get a
more carefully crafted sort of EXP
experience um that's really tailored to
what a visual studio user is probably
asking about whether they're starting in
the search or in the
chat V so it sounds to me like we've
done some rag like retrieval augmented
generation where we added an awareness
of keywords of settings and features
from feature search um and also other
resources like what's new information
that someone might have written for a
new release is that right
right um you know it's a we're starting
with uh settings and commands and uh
some other sources uh what's new is
coming down the pipe and we also have
aspirations to bring in other uh sources
using what you mentioned retrieval
augmented generation where you you bring
in uh known good information into uh the
AI and so it's able to give more
accurate responses uh for a really
specific scenario in our case asking
about visual studio um so yeah
I see and when I often look up
instructions for
something on the web I notice that I
have to first understand it and then
figure out where to click in the editor
um or how to do something myself because
they may say go do a new get restore and
I have to figure out hey what does this
mean how do I do that um and so could
you tell me more about how this feature
um helps
me spend less time translating something
that I've understood and actually making
something happen in visual
studio um sure well the idea is that you
know even if you don't know the name
that Visual Studio uses for some feature
um one thing that an AI is really great
at is understanding what you're trying
to say and so having that um pipeline
from you know your your brain uh to what
does a feature kind of look like in an
IDE and the AI understands that to
bringing in the specific uh terms for
things in visual studio uh we're able to
provide nice accurate instructions you
know even if you don't really know uh
how the right way to describe what
you're looking for as long as you get
close uh having an AI helps you get a
little bit closer instead of spending
you know 20 minutes on Google searches
and still not quite finding exactly what
it is you're looking for right and these
link outs of these settings we we link
out to the actual setting right so if
you tell me to change a setting there
should be a link for me that will take
me to that
setting yeah that's the idea um you know
when we detect that you know something
in the in the response from the AI is is
a setting that we know about we provide
a link so that you can get directly
there without necessarily have to follow
step one two three four five although
sometimes it's nice to see those
explicit steps if you're trying to
understand uh how to teach uh the
feature that you're uh looking
for right and so Switching gears a
little bit from the data science work to
the experience itself um from what we're
seeing today in preview what do you
think is left for room for improvement
that we want to build or work on in the
future yeah there's a lot of ways to
look about it so there's the basic
feature search experience that we've
already had in the product so there is
definitely room for us to improve to
make sure that it's covering the right
scenarios there make sure it's handling
differently formatted queries correctly
and that's like without AI even in the
picture but on the side with the work
that we've been doing with AI there's
definitely more opportunities like we
discussed before to bring in more
context from different sources to make
sure that the answers we're providing is
accurate and it provides the right
details but at the same time we don't
want to provide too much information to
overwhelm the model or confuse it or
bias it in a certain way so there needs
to be some work done to make sure that
we're picking the right context to send
over to them model and provide correct
responses from that and on the that note
there's also um more ux work that we
need to finish up with the flow that
we've been working on because there's
some things that aren't uh exactly
smooth with the experience so we wanted
to work on with the uh the links that it
provides the way that it works the
responses we want to make sure that it's
actually providing helpful information
there and actionable information that
the user can figure out what to do with
and it's not just providing things that
they don't know how to act
on yeah I I mean that sounds great
because we would want feature search to
work well within without co-pilot and it
sounds like any improvements that we
make to that will also improve
co-pilot and you know speaking with the
team that's building a feature that
helps you um resolve any unit test
failures they they also spoke about you
know being really selective with your
contacts so you can provide a good
precise answer for our listeners if you
haven't already tried it the default
shortcut for using feature search is
control Q um so do give that a try um is
there any specific feedback or kinds of
feedback that we're looking for from our
customers um as they try feature search
and feature search with get up co-pilot
that can help us build a better feature
yeah so uh the accuracy of results is
definitely one thing that we're
continuing to figure out how to measure
and figuring out ways to improve with a
feature search on its own that is
available in the product for everyone to
try out but the integration with
co-pilot is still an internal only
feature because we're trying to iron out
some of the details with the user
experience and make sure we're providing
uh results that are high enough quality
that we're ready to share to external
users so uh one way
to I guess test the accuracy the AI is
to try asking the chat directly if it's
able to figure out things but that
wouldn't have the context that we're
bringing into search I'm not really sure
what else we can answer with this
question gotcha so in the meantime give
control q a try see if it's able to
provide a result for something that
you're looking for and if you're not
leave us a comment below or use the
report a problem feature in the top
right of Visual Studio so that we can
keep track of scenarios that aren't
working well for you um and that's also
one way um to make sure that we have a
direct line of communication with you as
a
user thing that we'll do is that if you
subscribe um or if you take a look at
the description in this video uh once we
do have um what we demoed available for
you to try we will have the instructions
in the
description um so Switching gears a
little bit to the overall search space
it's great that we've got AI to improve
feature search but what about code
search I know that sometimes when I'm
hopping between different solutions and
projects that I'm not always familiar
enough with a codebase to know what
keywords to use uh with the existing
code search and control T um but also
find um and Def find and replace
experiences um so can we speak to
perhaps any thing that we're thinking
about with L natural language code
search yeah definitely for our team
specifically since we own a lot of those
search features like the uh code search
experience and find and files we're sort
of actively thinking about ways that AI
might be able to fit in and help users
find the answers that they're looking
for without having to do a normal
keyword search because there are some
scenarios that are better form as a
natural language query or are sort of
too complex to figure out a keyword
search or even a regular expression
query to find the answers that you need
so we definitely want to look into that
space in the future and explore what
technology is available to help provide
those answers and figure out the right
user experience for it as well because
we don't want to interfere with the
existing scenarios that people have
grown really accustomed to with finded
files and the existing code search so we
need to um sort of ideate do some more
investigation work on our end to figure
out what's the right way to bring in
these sorts of AI powered experiences
without to taking away from the existing
keyword searches
today gotcha so it sounds like the
keyword searches are very well loved and
that we are thinking about natural
language code search but if we do it we
have to make sure that um it doesn't
disrupt the current experience while
feeling in the user's flow
right and what about some of the other
experiences outside of control T um
what's happening there
Sandy yeah so I mean there are other
places where natural language search is
becoming a part of the visual studio
experience so for example in in co-pilot
chat you can you know make a direct
reference to your solution uh and this
works uh across languages um the context
from your solution is kind of brought in
when you make a query uh to co-pilot and
so you're able to ask a question like
like uh where's the codee that processes
uh customer invoices um and you know
that might that code might have an
obscure name and you're not sure how to
find it in control T because you're new
to the codebase but by asking a a
contextual question like that and by
bringing in that reference to the
solution uh the AI is often able to help
and and not tell you not only like where
it is but to give you a nice description
of how this code works and what are the
methods and other types that are
involved right and even though when we
think about code navigation we have find
all
implementations I feel like there's
still a gap where hey I'd like to find
all my synchronous methods because I'd
like to refactor them to be asyn or
maybe I'd like to find all asynchronous
methods that don't take a cancellation
token or maybe something as simple as
hey where are the various authentication
handlers because I want to understand
the different flows of authentication
token in my code base that we have
started releasing internally and we're
going to be asking people to dog fotage
soon to help us uh build that to uh
quality and make sure we're getting it
to a point where it is actually ready
for users to start consuming and
providing feedback to as as you know we
still need to do a lot of work to make
sure that the model is providing
accurate responses that it's utilizing
the context that we're providing
correctly and that the user experience
for um handling responses is smooth and
seamless as well so that users are
actually able to act on it and not AR
aren't only provided with a response
that they don't know what to do with
right I feel like one of my frustrations
with using search engines or other forms
of AI is some when it gives you an
answer that's actually inaccurate you
burn Cycles trying to figure out whether
you are wrong or right um but in the
meantime since this uses feature search
would it be valuable for users to
provide feedback on feature search
scenario so control Q uh that doesn't
give them the answers or settings that
they're looking
for yeah definitely we're actively
working on building test cases and
exploring different scenarios to make
sure that the work that we are doing is
actually impactful and is actually
solving real customer problems so any
feedback you can provide about what
scenarios aren't cover today in the ID
or scenarios that you would like to see
covered would be really helpful for
helping us determine what to do next

hey everyone i am rebecca khandelwal and
i welcome you all to yet another
exciting video from simply learn in this
session we will be discussing c-sharp
design pattern
however before we begin this session
make sure you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and clicked on the bell
icon below
so you never miss an update from simply
runs youtube channel
look at the agenda for today's topic
we shall begin our session with an
introduction to c-sharp design
then we will discuss types of design
patterns
first we will discuss the creational
design pattern
then we will have a look at the
structural design pattern and then at
last we will have a brief discussion
about behavioral design pattern finally
we will conclude this session with some
disadvantages of design pattern
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is design pattern
design patterns are reusable solution to
typical software design issues that
arise frequently in real-world
application development
patterns are employed by developers to
tackle challenges in their individual
designs understanding design patterns is
more important than memorizing their
classes methods and attributes
individual needs and difficulties
influence pattern selection and uses
among numerous design patterns
now let's discuss types of design
pattern
there are three types of design patterns
available
creational design pattern structural
design pattern and behavioral design
pattern
let's start up with creational design
pattern
the creational design patterns deal with
object creation and initialization
the creational design pattern gives the
programmer more flexibility in deciding
which objects need to be created for
give for a given case
we have five types of design patterns in
this
abstract factory builder factory method
prototype and singleton
let's discuss each of them in detail
first up abstract factory
the abstract factory design pattern
allows you to create families of linked
items without having to declare their
classes
next up builder pattern
builder is a design pattern that allows
you to build complicated objects in
stages
this patterns enables you to create many
types of representations of an object
while using the same creation code
next up factory method
a factory method is a creational design
pattern that provides an interface for
creating
objects in superclass while allowing
subclasses to choose the type of object
created
next up prototype
prototype pattern is a design pattern
that allows you to imitate existing
objects without making your code land on
their classes
the prototype patterns provides a basic
interface for working with all objects
that permits cloning to the client code
at last singleton
the singleton pattern ensures that a
class has only one instance while also
giving a global access point to that
instance
next up
let's discuss the structural design
pattern
the structural design pattern is
basically used to manage the structure
of classes and interfaces
as well as manage the relationship
between the classes
we have seven types of design patterns
in this
adapter
bridge composite pattern decorator
pattern a cat pattern fly weight pattern
and proxy
pattern let's discuss each of them in
detail
first up adapter
the adapter design pattern is a
structural design pattern that allows
items with conflicting interfaces to
work with one another
we use this pattern to reuse many
existing subclasses that lacks common
functionality that cannot be added to
the super class
next up bridge
this pattern is a structural design
pattern that allows you to split large
class or a collection of related classes
into two independent hierarchies
abstraction and implementation
next composite pattern composite is a
structural design pattern that enables
you to organize parts into three
structures
and manipulate them independently of one
another
the composite pattern provides two basic
element kinds with a shared interface
simple leaves and complex containers
after that decorator
decorator is a structural design pattern
that allows objects by wrapping them in
special wrapper object this pattern uses
the decorative technique to add extra
behaviors to objects without disrupting
the code that utilizes them
next up facade
for cad is a structural design pattern
that simplifies complex libraries
frameworks and class interfaces
when you require a simple but limited
interface to a complicated subsystem we
use the phycat pattern
at last proxy pattern
proxy is a structural design pattern
that enables you to substitute an item
a proxy control access to a source
object allowing you to do actions before
or after the request
next up is a behavioral design pattern
the behavioral design pattern deals with
communication between classes and
objects that means if you want to change
the behavior of a class and again you
want it to affect other classes of the
project as well
we have 10 types of design patterns
available in this
chain of responsibility iterator memento
speed template method command
mediator
observer strategy
and visitor
let's discuss them in detail
first up the chain of responsibility
a behavioral design pattern called the
chain of responsibility allows you to
pass requests along the chain of
handlers
when a request is received each handler
determines whether to process it or send
it to the next handler in the chain
next up iterator
iterator is a behavioral design pattern
that allows you to traverse components
of a collection without revealing the
representation below that is list stack
tree etc
iterators can be used to traverse
composite trees
next up is memento
memento is a behavioral design pattern
that saves and restores an object prior
straight
without revealing its implementation
when you need to take pictures of an
object's state in order to store it to a
previous state we use memento pattern
next up state pattern
state is a behavioral design pattern
that allows an entity to change its
behavior in response to the changes in
its internal state
it appears that the object's class has
changed
then the template pattern
template method is a behavioral design
that lets subclasses
alter steps of an algorithm without
changing its structure
we use the template method to allow
customers to extend specific types of an
algorithm
not the entire method or its structure
then we have
command pattern
command is a behavioral design pattern
that turns a request into a standalone
object
this transformation supports
unachievable operations and passing
request
as method argument
after that mediator mediator is a
behavioral design pattern that reduces
object dependency to collaborate the
objects must first communicate to a
mediator object
next up is observer pattern
observer is a behavioral design pattern
that allows you to establish a
subscription mechanism to allow alert
numerous objects about an event that
occur to the item being observed
when some objects in your app must
monitor others for a limited time or in
specific circumstances we use this
pattern
next up strategy pattern
strategy is the behavioral design
pattern that allows you to construct a
family of algorithms
classify them and make them object
interchangeable
when you have a bunch of similar classes
that just differ in how they perform
some behavior then we use the strategy
pattern
at last visitor the visitor pattern is a
behavioral design pattern that allows
you to decouple algorithms from the
objects they act on
when you need to perform an operation on
all elements of a complicated object
structure we use the visitor
finally let's conclude this tutorial
with some advantages of design patterns
first up abstract factory classes are
frequently based on set of factory
methods although the method on these
classes can also be composed using
prototype
next up to reduce ram we can use
flyweights to construct shared composite
tree leaf nodes
finally you can treat a visitor as a
powerful version of the command pattern
its objects can execute operation over
various objects of different classes and

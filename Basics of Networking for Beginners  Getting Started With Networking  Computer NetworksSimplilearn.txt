foreign
communication on the internet has always
been a complex topic to cover partly
because of the various pieces of the
person from basing appliances like
routers to multi-server data accounts
networking usually follows a particular
structure that is then scaled based on
the requirement
welcome to this video on the basics of
networking where we cover the multiple
Hardware elements and topologies of how
these Network setups work
let's take a look at the things we will
be covering today in our video
you start by learning about the
different network types and the
importance of an IP address in a network
environment
nice because the significance of
switches and the working of routers in a
network
moving on we cover the explanation of
subnets in a network and the importance
of network address translation or nand
finally we understand how firewalls work
the distance use cases of dmzs and port
forwarding

so let's get started with the two major
types of network that should be
considered basic knowledge for someone
starting out with networking lands and
rents the first variety of networks is a
local area network also known as Lang it
comprises of cables gateways switches
routers and additional parts that allow
these devices to connect to private
servers cloud services and other lands
via larger Networks the group of
virtualization has also sped up the
creation of virtual lands which select
Network managers divide and logically
organized Network nodes without having
to make significant modifications to the
infrastructure
the computers in each department could
be conceptually linked to the same
switch in an office with many
departments beat accountancy I.T support
and administration
still they might be segregated to
operate separately
the benefits of a land are similar to
those of any collection of connected
devices they may access and even control
one another exchange files print to
Shared printers and utilize a single
internet connection
to better understand this logic let us
take a sample structure
you can see the various components of a
local network connection in this picture
and now we can see three different
devices a system a laptop and a printer
so you have these few devices that need
to be connected to a single local AEG
Network
now to identify these devices inside the
network we need to assign an identifier
to each device so this is the an IP
address can help
an IP address is a lengthy string of
digits allocated to any device connected
to a network that utilizes Internet
Protocol as the communication medium is
the visual equivalent of your house or
workplace's mailing address
the addresses are divided into four
sections separated by Doms each
traditional Place strain numeral portion
represents an 8-bit binary integer which
can range from 0 to 255.
these four integers are expressed in
normal decimal notation and then
separated by top
however computers work with binary
numbers meaning zeros and ones and each
number in an ipv4 address represents an
8-bit binary integer which is why none
of them can be more than 255.
the distribution of this IP addresses is
not just limited to LAN every device
which is a part of the network will have
its own IP address as assigned by the
network administrator as seen in the
picture we can now identify each device
individually by the designated IP
addresses
now the primary purpose of a network
being the ability of multiple devices to
communicate and exchange information
with each other these IP addresses serve
only half the purpose since allotment
and identification of these addresses
need to be managed automatically and On
Demand if the laptop shown on the left
of the screen wants to use the printer
in the network it needs to know which
particular device or more precisely
which particular IP address to
communicate
this is where a switch comes into play
it takes a role of the delegation and
commands in a particular Network
let's learn more about switches in
detail
a network switch joints devices in a
network such as computers printers
wireless access funds and allows them to
communicate with each other by
exchanging data packets we can do both
physical Hardware devices that handle
real networks or software-based virtual
devices
the vast majority of network equipment
in modern data networks are switches the
link extra PCS access points automated
equipment and some iot devices via wired
connections such as card entry systems
The Limited computers and data centers
that run virtual machines or VMS as well
as the actual server and most of the
storage equipment
based on the type of switches employed
they can either differentiate between
network devices using either the IP
addresses or Mac addresses which are
separate types of addresses allotted to
each Hardware device irrespective of the
network it is connected to
now that you understand the major parts
of a local area network a major query
that may come to your mind is how can
these local networks then communicate
with other networks a rocker is employed
at the Forefront of every network setup
to facilitate communication between
foreign Networks
this router can then be used to connect
to the Internet so we can communicate
with the loved ones from the comfort of
our own homes
so let's learn a little more about
routers
the router is a physical or virtualized
Internet working equipment that receives
analyzes and transfers data packets
across computer networks the router
checks and data packets destination IP
address and utilizes headers and
forwarding tables to determine the best
path to transport the packet
consider the router to be an air traffic
controller and data factors to be
airplanes flying to various airports or
networks in this case
each package like each check has a
unique destination and must be steered
to its destination as effectively as
possible
a router helps direct these data packets
to the intended IP addresses in the same
manner that the air traffic controller
ensures that flights arrive at their
destination without getting lost or
experiencing severe destructions
a router employs an internal routing
table which is a collection of Pathways
to multiple Network destinations to
properly direct packets
it scans the header of a packet to
establish its destination then consults
a routing table to find the most
efficient way to their destination
the packet is subsequently sent to the
next Network along the Route
also has an IP address which is often
called as the network Gateway
a crucial part of the networking setup
is determining whether a particular
piece of Hardware is a part of local
network or a foreign device
as you already know specific IP
addresses exist for each device in a
network be it a local or wide area
network all these IP addresses must
belong to a particular range of
addresses which are often known as the
subnet or sub Network and which help
determine the overall range of a local
area network
for example the IP addresses that can be
seen on the screen right now belong to a
software that is 255.255.0.0
the first two flags did not fix values
that must be present in every single IP
address of every single device in this
particular Network
in our case the 192.168 is the
consistent factor in every single IP
address shown on the screen
this implies that if the devices can
connect to a piece of equipment with an
IP address and it starts from 192.168
that device will most likely be in the
same local area network
the last two places are the free ranges
in this example which means they can be
any number less than 255 further helping
the router and switch differentiate
between multiple IP addresses in a
network
with that being said we can now take a
look at how wide area networks work
a wide area network or a van is in its
most basic form a collection of local
area networks for any other networks
that interact with one another
why Data Network is essentially a
network of networks with internet
serving as the world's biggest one
however when a router communicates with
devices outside a local network it tends
to mask the internally allocated IP
addresses and uses a single public IP
address for all the devices
this process is called Network address
translation or Nat IP allocation
a network address translation is a
method of translating one IP address to
another while these packets are in
transit through a router this improves
security and reduces the number of IT
addresses required by a company
answer Auto receive some particular
information that must be transmitted to
a local device in the network it checks
the internal routing tables to determine
the correct internal IP address and the
correct destination to send the external
leadership data to
but let's see a device on external
network or a wide area network wants to
communicate it directly with a device
from the local network
this cannot be allowed since this can be
a very big security risk for devices in
a secure environment
all of this m3m exit rule creation and
handling can be taken care of by a
firewall
a firewall is a type of network security
device that analyzes the incoming and
outgoing networking traffic and allows
organized data packets depending on a
set of security rules its objective is
to provide a barrier between your local
network and external jackets such as the
internet
the most common sort of firewall which
are packed at filtering firewalls check
packets and prevent them from getting
through if they do not meet an
established security rule set
this sort of firewall examines the
packet's destination and Source IP
addresses if the packet fits an allowed
rule on the firewall they are permitted
to access the network
but let's say we as users want to allow
external requests to reach individual
computers or devices on our local
network
there are two ways to facilitate this
Behavior the first way to go through
this step is by using a DMZ which stands
for a demilitarized zone
instead of communicating directly with
the local network device the external
data is sent to the router instead
the router will have created a DMZ sub
network with only those devices added to
it that require other external
information to reach them on altered
once the data is received by the router
it passes it on to the dng subnet and
subsequently to all the devices which
are a part of that summary
however since the external data can
reach devices in a network without any
firewall checks if they are part of the
DMZ subnet the security risk associated
with this method are very large compared
to the second variant which is port
forward
ing is a method of granting external
devices access to computers on private
networks it accomplishes this by
translating an external IP address and
port to an internal IP address and port
all the devices talk to each other and
the network Gateway using the IP
addresses and specific ports for example
the TCP IP protocol basic internet usage
uses Port 80 on every Network
similarly we can create additional file
or rules to open up certain ports for
external devices to communicate with if
the designated ports are open during
communication the firewall will allow
the external network device or server to
communicate directly with the local
network device without any hindrance
that's all we really need to know for

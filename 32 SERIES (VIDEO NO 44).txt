hello everyone this is dr. Amiya in this
32 series we are going to discuss some
important points from the topic of
restorative resins phone number one in
heat cube the monomer consists of
unpolymerized methyl methacrylate
hydroquinone the inhibitor glycol limit
acrylate the cross-linking agent number
two the polymer powder consists of pre
polymerized bits of poly methyl
methacrylate and benzoyl peroxide s as
in treated number three self cure has
same composition accepted the liquid
consists of dimethyl Perito lead in the
activator which is returned sherry MN
number for boiling point of monomer is
100.8 degree Celsius number five in
light activated composites camphor aqua
nam is initiator and dial tone is the
accelerator number six in chemically
activated composites benzoyl peroxide is
in cheetah and dairy she area mine is
the activator number seven
polymerization of bencher base is an
exothermic reaction number eight
hydroquinone is the inhibitor which
prevents the polymerization of liquid
during storage
number nine polymer monomer interaction
proceeds in sandy stringy stuff like
elastic and stiff stages in this duff
stage is ideal for packing number ten
plastic or Teflon coated instruments
should be used with composites number
eleven benzoin methyl ether is the
activator in you may like curing system
number twelve the optimal polymer is to
an excess of monomer leads to increased
polymerization shrinkage on number 13 37
percent phosphoric acid is used as an
etchant concentration above 50 percent
results in formation of monocalcium
phosphate monohydrate which prevents
further dissolution this agent is
supplied in a gel form to ello control
over the area of placement number 14
glycol dimethyl fellate which is a
cross-linking agent has two double bonds
whereas methyl methacrylate has
single-bond number 16 configuration
factor that is the c factor means bonded
surface been unbounded surfaces number
17 the higher bc factor greater is the
potential for bond disruption number 18
for Potts tungsten light pure device
optimal output energy is four hundred to
eight hundred millivolts per square
centimeter number nineteen the minimum
output energy should not be Lizzie
hundred milli watt per square centimeter
number twenty chemically activated
resist display three to five percent
free monomer whereas heat activated
resins exhibit 0.2 to 0.5% of free
monomer number twenty one for each one
percent increase in weight produced by
the water absorption acrylic resin
expands 0.23 percent linearly number
twenty two modulus of elasticity of
polymethyl methacrylate e's twenty two
point four gigapascals number
twenty-three the molecular weight of
monomer is hundred number 24 the density
of monomer is zero point zero four five
gram per milliliter at 20 degrees
Celsius number twenty-five the heat of
polymerization of monomer is twelve
point nine kilo calorie per mole number
twenty-six the volumetric shrinkage
during polymerization of monomer is two
point one percent number twenty seven a
small molecule added to lower the glass
transition temperature of a polymer is
known as plasticizer number twenty eight
polymer to monomer ratio is same for
both heat activated and chemically
activated resins number twenty nine the
ratio of polymer to monomer is 3 is to 1
by volume and 2 is to 1 by weight number
30
using threes to one ratio the volumetric
strain gage can be limited to
approximately seven percent number 31
the time required for the resin mixture
to reach the flood stage is termed as
the forming time number thirty-two for
composites the light curing units are
designed to emit light within the range
of 400 to 500
that's it for today's session guys all
the points discussed in this series are
very important from neat and aims point
of view so keep on revising these points
all the best thank you

hey guys welcome back to another
tutorial by simply learn in this video
tutorial we will be learning about some
c plus plus projects for 2022 that would
be helpful for you to learn and grasp c
plus plus programming language in a
practical way
we will not only discuss these projects
but also will make these projects from
scratch using some basic concepts of c
plus plus
so we will start with the hotel
management project in which we will have
the information of the items or rooms
that we have
what food items are ordered by the
customer and how many rooms are allotted
to them etc
then we will make another project on
registration and login form
in this project we will learn how to
make the complete structure and
functionality of the login and
registration form
first we will learn how to create a
login page in c plus
in the menu there will be different
options like registration login and
forward password etc
after that we will make a supermarket
billing project in c plus
in this project there will be various
functions that we will be creating for
this project like add function to add
the goods and products in the market and
delete to delete some products
etc and at last we will make an airline
registration system in c plus plus
this project on airline reservation
system will allow a user to book a
flight to a particular country of his
choice and he or she will receive the
ticket by filling in all the important
details etc
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
now let's go ahead
this project will be a hotel management
project in which we will have the
information of the items or rooms that
we have in the hotel and what are the
food items ordered by the customer
also we have the information that how
many rooms are allotted to them
also this project will tell us about the
sales and the remaining food stocks we
have and the total collection of the day
we will make this project in three parts
firstly we will discuss the first part
in which we will declare some variables
and then initialize them
after that we will enter the quantities
of items that we have in the hotel
then we'll make a list of items or menu
of items and rooms that we have in the
hotel
so let's start
now we will switch to our code editor
that is dev c plus plus
so this is a code editor so here first
of all let's make a new file
we'll click on file and now we'll create
a new file
so now let's start with the project so
first of all inside the main function we
have to declare some variables but
before that
we will
write the header files that is hash
include iostream
and then the namespace standard
alright so we have included the header
files now we'll start with the main
function
inside the main function
we will declare the variable
so first variable that will declare
would be quant which stands for quantity
and the second variable would be choice
now we will declare those variables
that store the quantity of food items or
rooms
so let's say
the variable which will store the
quantity of rooms would be q
rooms
and
we have to initialize it also
all right so similarly we have to do it
with the food items as well so let us
suppose uh one of our food item is pasta
so we'll write
q pasta that is quantity pasta
we'll initialize it with zero
similarly we'll do with the rest of the
food items
that is burger
noodles
and shake
and chicken
here chicken would be let's say chicken
roll
so these are our food items so these
variables will hold the quantity of
these food items
so now we will declare those variables
which will hold the value of the number
of food items that have been sold so for
example q pasta holds the value of
number of
pastas we had in our hotel and s pasta
will hold the value of number of pastas
that have been sold
so let's start
similarly we'll write s
rooms that is sold rooms
we have to initialize it with zero as
well
and s pasta
similarly asperger
s noodles
as chicken
all right
now we will create some more variables
that will store the price of the total
price of each of these food items or
rooms so let's do that let's say in
total
underscore rooms this is the variable
name
it will store the total price of the
rooms
we'll initialize it with zero similarly
total
pasta
equals zero
total
burger
all right
so these variables holds the quantity of
food we have
these variables holds the quantity of
food we sold and these variables will
hold the price the total price of each
of the food items or rooms
so let's
comment it these holes quantity
so that it's easy for you guys
all right so here we have declared these
variables
now
now we will make a list kind of a
structure in which we will ask
the user
to enter the number or quantities of
food items or rooms that we have in the
hotel
so
all right now let's do this
first of all we have to
display a message
but before that we'll use slash n and
slash t
so slash n means the next line and slash
t will add a horizontal space in the
output
so we need
that horizontal space
so we'll write
quantity of food
let's say items only quantity of items
we have
we have in a hotel
all right
now
we'll write rooms available
so we'll add slash n and
rooms
available
all right so after this
we will write c in and take the input of
quantity of rooms we have because here
we are asking to enter the number of
rooms we have
so we'll write c in
q rooms because it holds the quantity of
rooms we have
we have initialized it with zero
similarly we'll do it for the rest like
quantity of pasta like this will do
inside the
slash n
now we'll write the quantity of pasta
see in
q pasta
all right
now similarly
let's copy paste
and save some time
so this first was the pasta then burger
and cuber
then there was noodles
few noodles
similarly we'll do it for shake
and then
here chicken is the chicken rule
so quantity of chicken rule
cue
chicken all right
so
one by one q room the quantity of rooms
we have to add q pasta the quantity of
pasta we have to add then quantum burger
we have
all right now we have to create a menu
to select the pasta burger room all the
items we have to create a menu like that
and for that let's do this
we'll write c out again we'll use
slash n
slash and then
again slash d slash
t
because you want some horizontal space
in that
we'll display a message saying that
please select from the given menu
options
all right
so it's a message for the users
or the customers i would say
now again we'll use slash n
because i want to add some new lines
so i'll use two selection
now
first is rooms
secondly we'll use only one selection
and
here we are creating the
menu to select the food items or rooms
so now we will write
pasta
and similarly we'll copy paste
so pasta then there was burger
then noodles
and there was shake
then there was chicken
chicken roll
we also have to change the numbering
that this is one this is two
then this is three
we are doing the numbering because the
customer will press the number
and then he can order
five
six
and now again we'll
in seventh position we'll add the
details or information
regarding the collection and sales
so
[Music]
we'll write
press 7 if you want to see the
information
regarding
sales
and collection
this option would be used by the owner
of the hotel to check the total
collection for the day
all right now again
the eighth number
is for
if we want to exit
yeah
so this is done now
after that we'll display a message
saying that
please enter your choice
so we'll use slash and slashing and
right
please enter
your choice
now i will write c in choice we have
already declared this variable
now based on this choice your order is
selected like if you press
2 then this pasta would be selected like
let's say if you want to order noodles
then you have to select four and if you
want to
order chicken roll then you have to
select six and if you want to
check the total sales and connect
collection of today
that is
for a particular day then you have to
click 7 and 8 for the exit
so a first part is done now in the
second part we have to add the
functionality to the choice part that is
if a user enters the first number that
is number one then rooms is selected and
then he or she have to add the numbers
of rooms they want
similarly for the other food items as
well like if they want to take two
burgers or three burgers instead of one
and we only have one burger left
then also we have to display a message
saying that only so and so burgers are
left
so now let's start with it
so now we'll write switch case
statements so when the user will select
a particular number
so that particular case would be
executed
so now let's
do that
right switch
and
inside the switch statement
we'll write choice
now the choice can be one two three four
five six seven eight
all right so now we have to create eight
cases for that
so case one would be
we'll start with it
there's a space between case and one
all right so case one would be
first of all inside the case 1
that is the case when rooms have to be
selected so first of all we'll display a
message saying that enter the number of
rooms you want
so let's do that
use slash n
now
enter the
number of rooms you want
all right
now after that
the user will enter the number of rooms
that is the quantity of rooms
so now we'll take the quantity
in the quantity variable that is quant
variable
so the user will enter the number of
rooms that is the quantity of rooms he
or she wants
now we'll use a if statement an if
statement inside this if statement now
inside this if statement will check do
we actually have that many rooms in our
hotel or do we actually have that many
pastas or burgers in our hotel
right now so for that we have to write
down a condition that is
q rooms
minus s rooms
is greater than
equal to
quant
that is
q rooms is the quantity of rooms that we
have and s rooms the number of rooms
that we have sold
so if
we minus both of these that is if we
subtract the quantity of room we have
minus the rooms we have sold we will get
the remaining rooms now if the remaining
rooms it's greater than equal to the
quantity of rooms that have been ordered
by the customer then
we can give the room to them otherwise
we have to display a message saying that
we don't have that many rooms or
something like that
so let's do that so we'll write s rooms
that is the rooms that we have sold so
initially its value is zero so we have
to add the values of quantity that have
been
entered by the user so we'll add the
quant variable that is if the user have
entered two rooms he or she wants then
we'll
add the add those two values to this
sold rooms
all right after adding the quantity to
the sold rooms now
we will do the total price of the room
or rooms
and for that we have the variable total
room
so we'll add
this quant
into the price of a one room
to this total room
so
we are simply adding
total room
plus
quant
into the price of a single room that is
let's say 1200 is the price of a single
room
if a person orders two rooms then it
would be like quant that is two two into
1200 2400 will be added to this total
room this total room is the total price
of a room
all right
now we also have to display a message
saying that these many rooms have been
allotted to you so for that let's
display a message
first of all we'll use slash n
like two times now we'll add some
horizontal space as well
all right
now we'll display this quant variable
and write a message
that these many rooms
have been
allotted
to you
let me let's make it room or rooms
room or rooms have been allotted to you
so this message will be displayed
all right
now
this is the if block
now we'll have to make the else block
that
if the
amount or quantity of room entered by
the user is more than the remaining
rooms then we'll display a message
saying that only so and so rooms are
left in the hotel
so we'll use slash n then again slash d
now we'll write
only
q rooms
minus s rooms that is here q room minus
s room is the remaining rooms are the
remaining rooms so
subtracting both of these
variables will give us the remaining
rooms so
these were the remaining rooms
remaining
in
hotel
all
right and let's not add these as there's
a single statement
also we have to use break
so we'll use break statement now
similarly we have to create case two
this case was for the room
so whenever a user click on this one
then this case will be
executed so similarly we'll create a
case 2
so let's
we'll copy it now we'll paste it
so
[Music]
i will case 2
so in this case enters the number of
rooms you want we can't we can't write
that
so we'll write past the quantity
so let's do that
we'll write
enter
pass the
quantity
all right so
in this case
the c in would be same that is quantity
variable we have
so
now in this case the different thing
would be the queue rooms instead of q
rooms we'll use the
q pasta that is the quantity of pasta
minus sold pastas
it must be greater than quantity of
pasta we have
then only if block will execute
otherwise similarly as that of this
block
will display a message
so now
the s rooms instead of s rooms here
we'll use s pasta
which is initially zero
so we'll add the quantity of pasta to
this variable that is will add the
quantity of pasta that is ordered by the
custard to this variable
now
total pasta that is a total price of the
pasta
so the number of pastas ordered by the
customer into the price of a single
pasta let's say the price of a single
pasta is around 250.
so quantity into 250
now
rooms instead of rooms let's do here
pasta is the order
so quant
so quant will display the
quantity
so it will display like if you have
order two pastas will it will display
two
pasta
is the
order
and
q rooms here we have to display the
remaining so we'll do the q pasta minus
s pasta
and here we will do is pass the
remaining in hotel or stock
past the remaining in hotel
so it will display the remaining pasta
remained in the hotel now
so else everything is fine now similarly
we'll do for the next
we'll copy it it will save some time
and paste it now this is case three the
case three is of burger so we will
write
burger
quantity of burger minus
sold burgers
similarly s burger
now the total price of burger
so let's say the price of a burgle is
around 120
and so
the remaining burgers q burger minus s
burger
the fourth case now
that is the noodles case
so enter noodles quantity
now case five
now case 5 is of shakes
so we'll write enter shakes quantity
now
case 6 we have to create
in the case 6 there is chicken roll
so let's do that
chicken
minus s chicken
also we have to change the price of each
meal like chicken roll
would be of around 150.
and this shake would be
120
noodles
140 let's say
burger is okay then
pasta is also okay
so we have created six cases as of now
so our second part of the program is
done now we'll start with the third part
of the program
so the third part will contain the case
7 case 8 and the default case
that is if the user enters any other
number which is not in the list that
will come under default case
in case 7 we have to display the
information of sales and collection that
is how many
money we have collected for the day and
the remaining food items etc
so now let's start with the case
so when the user will enter
7 that is case 7
then he want to see the details of the
information of sales and collection
so we'll display a message saying that
details
of sales
and
collection
all right
so after this message let's add slashing
slash t slash t
all right
so after this message
we have to display the number of rooms
we had the number of rooms we gave for
rent
and then the remaining rooms that is
minus the quantity of rooms minus the
soul rooms then the total rooms
collection for the day
so similarly we will do for all the
meals like pasta burger noodles etc
so let's do it
so we'll start
display
first of all we'll add slashing
now
number of rooms
we had
display queue rooms that is the
quantitative rooms we had
now
similarly
number of
rooms we give
for rent
all right
so we'll write
s
runes
now we have to display a message
similarly we'll write slash and slashing
remaining
rooms
so
for that we have to simply subtract
queue rooms with s rooms that will give
us the remaining rooms
after that
the total price that the room has
collected or number of rooms have
collected
so we'll write
total rooms
collection
for the day
now
it is stored at total rooms
this variable is storing the total
drives of rooms
this is the complete information of
rooms similarly we have to do it for the
burger noodle pasta etc
so we can copy we'll copy this part
and we'll do
copy and paste
and paste
again will paste
now number of rooms we had instead of
this we'll simply write number of pastas
we had
number of pastas
we have to change that
number of pastas we
sold
yeah that would be right
now remaining past us
there are few minor changes that we have
to do
total
pasta collection
also make sure to change the variables
total
pasta
then
q pasta
all right now
after pasta it was burger
burgers we have
number of burgers we sold
all right so
it would be q burger
and this burger
remaining burgers
total burger collection for the day
all right
now we'll do same for
noodles
all right now shakes
number of shakes we had
number of shakes we give
we sold
remaining shakes
now there is chicken roll
number of chicken rule we had
all right now the case eight the case
eight we have used for this was the case
7 and the case 8 we have used for exit
as you can see here
this is the exit case
and for that
we'll simply use
the exit statement the exit statement is
used to terminate the program to shift
the control out of the program or exit
the program
so here we'll use that so case 8 would
be
exit and inside that will use 0 0 will
mean that 0 millisecond
and now after that we'll have to use the
default case
that if the user enters any other number
that is not present in the menu list
then this default case will be executed
so in this
default case we'll display a message
saying that please select from the
numbers that are mentioned above so
we'll use slash n
please
select
the numbers
mentioned above
so this message will be printed
and also one more thing is there
we have to use a go to statement
and we'll have to label
a part with
m now i'll explain to you that why have
we used this jump statement that is go
to statement
so after making a choice we again want
to choose another option that is if i
have ordered two pastas then i also want
to order two
burgers as well
so
we will mark
or label
menu with m
so this is a menu please select from the
menu options so here we will label m
and
in the last we have used the go to
statements
so the go to statement here will
transfer the control to the menu after
making a choice
so again m is the label we have used for
the menu and we will use a go to
statement to transfer the control to the
menu after making the choice so that we
can make more choices
go to is a jump statement basically that
is used to jump from one part to another
part having a specified label
so we have labeled menu with m and this
go to jump statement will help us in
jumping to the menu after every choice
all right so our code is done we have
done all the things that we need
now we need to run it
and for that firstly we need to save it
all right so let's go to files and save
it
and now let's
select the destination folder
let's name it as
management
management dot cpp
all right
so the program is saved
now let's try to
compile and run this program
so there are some errors i can see okay
so
we have used
the semicolon
now
this will take care of many errors now
let's try to again compile and run
let's check q noodles
all right i think uh
q noodles
so we have two backspaces now
let's try to compile and run again
hope it works now
so quantity of items we have as we can
see
so rooms available let's say we have 10
rooms
and quantity of pasta
we have
25 pastas in our hotel
and around 50 burgers
and 30 noodles
and
30 shakes
chicken roll we have 40
so this is the menu please select from
the menu options as you can see
first rooms
then pasta burger noodles shake chicken
roll information regarding sales and
collection and then it to exit
so first of all
let's say
i want to order two rooms so i'll click
one
please enter your choice i have clicked
one and i'll press enter now enter the
number of rooms you want and let us
suppose i want two rooms
so as you can see
two room or rooms have been allotted to
you
now again the menu is displayed on the
screen now let's say i want
burgers so i'll click on three
and i want two burgers
and two burger is the order it is
displayed
now again i want a
pasta let's say
i want
six pastas
and six pasta eight the order i want
to order now shakes
let's have something to drink i want to
order
nine shakes
nine shakes is the order
and
let's say
so as we know that we have only 10 rooms
now let's try to enter 11
so first of all we'll enter one that is
rooms
now let's try to order
11 rooms
as you can see only eight
eight rooms available or remaining in
hotel so we forgot to add some space
over this part
but we can easily read it now as of now
so it is displaying the message that
only eight rooms are available because
already we have ordered
two early it was ten then now only eight
rooms are available so this is showing
that if we
order
more than the quantity then it will
display this message
now let's say i want to
check the information regarding sales
and collection of today's
rooms and as well as meals so i'll
simply click on seven
now as we can see it will simply display
all the
sales and collection
rooms and meals as you can see number of
rooms we had 10 number of rooms we gave
for rent two remaining rooms are eight
so total rooms collection for the race
2400 as one room is of 1200
so similarly number of pastas we had 25
number of pastas we sold six remaining
pastas we had 19 so the total pasta
collection is 1500 so and so the burger
and then noodles and then shakes and
chicken roll
so this is the total chicken roll
collection for the day
that that is we haven't ordered a single
chicken roll also we can do one more
thing we can simply
display the total result of all the
collections of rooms and meals
so let's do that
now so to display the total collection
of the day all we need to do is to add
all the totals of pastas burgers and
rooms
so for that we have to go to case seven
i'll write slash and slash in slashing
three times
so here we'll write total collection for
the day
and after that
total rooms
plus
total
total burgers
total pasta
plus total
burger
total
chicken
all right after this we will use the
break statement
now let's run the program
so here it is rooms available
let's write 10
quantity of pasta 30
quantity burger 50
quantity of noodles 30
shakes 30
chicken roll
40.
so first of all i'll book two rooms i'll
click on one and now two rooms
and again
if i'll click on
rooms
and then if i try to click
10 rooms because already we have two
sold we sold two rooms then it will
display that only eight rooms remaining
in hotel
now i'll
click on two to order pasta let's say i
have ordered five pastas
and
five pasta is the order
now let's say if we click on nine
although we know that only one to eight
numbers are available but if we click on
nine
so it will display a message please
select the numbers mentioned above
all right now let's say i have i want to
order chicken roll
10 chicken rolls i want
so 10 chicken roll is the order now i
want to check information regarding
sales and connection for the day
so click on 7
and then here i can see
number of rooms we had number of rooms
we gave for rent remaining rooms and
total collection for the day similarly
for the pasta
similarly for the burger similarly for
noodles
shakes and
chicken roll as well
and this is the total collection for the
day 5150 exit and if we click on it we
can exit
so as we can see
this is our hotel management project
and this is how it's done
the code is bit long but it's worth it
you can also try this project on your
own
this project will be a login and
registration system in c plus
in which a user can register log in and
also if he or she forgets the password
then also it can be recovered
we will make this project using the
fundamentals of c plus like switch case
statements and file handling operations
etc
so let's go ahead and understand this c
plus plus project of login and
registration system
in this project first of all we will
make a menu page
in which there are options like login
registration
forgot password and exit
then we'll ask the user to select anyone
among those options
once the user has selected a particular
option
then we have to continue with the
functionality of that
so now let's switch to our code editor
and do its practical implementation
so this is our dev c plus code editor
now let's create a new file
now first of all we will include the
header files
the hash include iostream
then there is
f stream class or file handling
operation
hash include f stream
then there is string dot h
for string
then we will include the namespace
standard
now we will do the forward declaration
for three functions that is login
function registration function and
forward function
and after that inside the main function
we will make the menu for the login page
so let's start
first of all we are doing the forward
declaration
this is the login function
this is the registration function
and this is the forward function
now inside the int main
first of all we will make a variable
c which stands for choice c for choice
so now
we will make the menu page
so let's
create use
slash t writing the horizontal space
now in the end we will use slash n
all right similarly we'll do here
welcome to
the login page
now again we'll do the same
slash d
slash t slash t
and now
underscores
menu
slash insulation
all right now we will make the options
so we'll do the slash d
now after slash t will add
vertical bar
then
we'll write press
one
to login
let's make it capital
press one to login
and after making some space then
vertical
bracket again
then end l
similarly we'll copy it and do for
option 2.
press 2
to register
all right
let's maintain the symmetry
press three
if you forgot your password all right
press 4 to exit
all right
so this is done now after that we will
ask the user to enter your choice
and for that we'll display a message
saying that
please enter your choice
but before that we'll use slash n and
some slash d's
all right now we'll ask the user please
enter your
choice
all right
now we'll take the input of the choice
that is c that we have already declared
next line
now we'll use switch case statements
for example if the user selects 2 to
register first of all
then
inside the switch case statement in case
2 we will call the registration function
and if the user enters 1 then we will
call
the login function
so let's do that
let's create a switch statement
and see
that is choice
now inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create a case one
inside this case there would be
login
we are calling this logging function
and then there is break statement
all right similarly now we will
create case 2.
so case 2 would be registration
here we are calling the registration
function
and then there is break statement
in case three there is forgot function
that is if the user forgets the password
then this function will be implemented
now
there is a default case
no now there is a case 4
in case 4 there would be
a message saying that
thank you
because
case 4 would be exit
so we'll display a message saying that
now we will also have to make the
default case
that is if the user selects 5 6 or any
other number that is not in the menu
then we will display a message saying
that
please select from the options given
above
so before that we'll add the slash d
please select
from the options
given above
after that we'll use slash n
[Music]
after that we'll call the main function
so that the control goes back to the
main function
and we'll also use
system
cls that is clear screen
it means every time the code is
processed it will clear up the screen
now all we need to do is to create the
login function
so
i'll write void
login
and inside this function first of all
we'll create some variables
and so let's do that and count
user
id no this user id would be of string
write
string
user id
then there would be
password
then id
then pass
all right so these are the variables
that we have created
now again we'll use the
system cls
that is clear screen
we have to
write cls inside the double quotes
all right now we will display a message
that please enter the username and
password
so we'll do that
and we'll write slash g slash d slash d
and
please enter
the username
and
password
all right now
will again display a message saying that
username
now we will take the input
so here user id
is the username that the user will enter
now again we will display a message
saying that password
let's make it capital
again we'll take the input
now as the user has entered the username
and password
now we will check that if that username
and password already exist in our
records
and for that we will use the file
handling operation of if stream class
because if stream is used
to read the data
so
we will use if stream
and if stream class
this will read the data from the file
input is the object name
and the file name would be
records
dot txt
all right we'll have to
[Music]
make it inside the double quotes
all right
so now this if stream will check inside
the file that if that login password
exists or not
and to check that we will have to use
the while loop
inside the while loop will write
input that is the object name
then there would be id
and then
pass
so this is the id and password
and this is how we read in file handling
operations here what we are doing is we
are reading that if
that id and password is there
and then we will match those id and
password
with
the id and password that is entered by
the user
so for that we will have to use the if
condition inside the while loop
so let's do that
we will write if
id equals user id
and
pass equals password
then
count would be
one
and then we will use system cls to clear
the screen
here we have assigned one to count
because in the next part we will use an
if condition that if the count is one
then we will display a message saying
that
your login is successful that is the
password or username entered by the user
matches with the record that is
the user has already registered
so now before that we have to close this
file
so
let's do that
we'll to close this file we will use the
object name that is input dot
close this is how we can close the file
all right now we'll use the if condition
and inside this if condition
as i have said if count equals one
all right if count equals one
then we will first of all display the
user id that is the username
and then we will display a message that
your login is successful
so let's do that
your login
is successful
now thanks for logging in
now again we will
shift the control to the main
because there is the main menu
and now
inside the else block
we will display a message
that is if the user and password is not
found inside the file
then
it means that the
user is not registered so he can't login
he has to register first
so we'll
display a message
saying that
login error
please check your username
now again
main function
now we have to create another function
that is the registration function
that is if the user press 2 then this
registration function would be called
so let's create this function
void registration
now inside this function we will first
of all create some variables then after
that we'll ask the user to enter the
username and password pretty much the
same as that of the previous function so
first of all string
r for registration
user
id
our user id
then r
password
then rid and our pass
system cls again clear screen
all right
now we will
display a message saying that enter the
username
again
enter the password
our password
all right
so in the previous function we have used
if stream class but in this function we
will use off stream class because we
want to write inside the file and off
stream helps us with that
so
for that we will use off stream
and the object name would be f1
and
records is a file
and we will use the
app mode this ios mean the input output
stream and app will open the file and
append the output in the end
so this is our app mode there are
different modes
so here we are using this app mode
so after this we'll put the semicolon in
the end
now
we have to write inside the file so
we'll do the
f1
and this is how we write inside the file
f1 here is the object name
and our user id
is the username and after that we'll add
some space
and then
our
password
that is the password
we want some space between the username
and password that is why we have
used the single quotes and
this is how we write inside the file and
after that we'll again use the system
cls that is the clear screen
all right
now we'll display a message that
registration is successful
as we have already written inside the
file so now we can display this message
saying that registration is successful
now again control back to the main
function
so now we will create the forgot
function
this is the last function
void
forgot
so
this function
would be called when the user forgots
the password or username
so first of all we will create a
variable
option
now we will ask the user that you forgot
your password no worries then we'll ask
the user to press one to search your id
by you
by your username and press 2 to go back
to the main menu
so let's start
before that we will use system cls
all right now we'll display the message
saying that
you forget the password
no worries
and then
new slashing
now press one
to search
your
id
by username
all right
now
press 2 to go back to the main menu
all right now after that
we'll use slash d
all right now enter your choice
now we'll take the input
c in
option
after that using the switch case
statement
option
now inside the switch case
you will create cases
so case one
that is when the user selects option one
then
hint
we'll use bracket over here because
there would be
multiple lines
all right
now int
count will initialize it with zero
now
some more variables we will declare the
string
s user id
and
s id
then s pass
so these are some string variables and
count is the integer variable after that
we'll display a message that enter the
username which you remembered
so let's do it
the username
you remembered
all right
now
we will take the input from the user
as user id
so once the user entered the username
then we will check
that if that username exists in the file
using the if stream object as we know
stream is used when we want to read from
the file or check from the file
so we'll create the if stream class
and the object name would be f2
and
records.txt is the file
all right now using the while loop
we will check
that if
the username is there inside the file or
not
so s id
and s pass
so now
if
s id equals
s
user id
then
count equals one
so we will assign one to count and
after that we will close the file that
is f2
dot close
so here what we are doing is we are
checking inside the file using the
stream object that if that id or
password is there and if that id is
there then we'll assign one to the count
as initially it was zero and then again
we'll do the same as that we have in the
pre as we have done in the previous
function that if count equals to one
then we will
print a message that your account is
found
so let's do that
so as we have closed the file now after
that
we'll use an if statement
with a condition that if
count equals one
then we will print a message saying that
your account is found
your password is
s pass
so it will display the password
again the control will be shifted to the
main
where there is the main menu
and inside the else block now
inside the else block will
display a message
saying that
sorry your account is not found
sorry
your account
is not
found
so as the case one ends we will use the
break statement
now we will create case 2.
in case 2 as we have
said that it will simply call the
go back to the main menu so
all we'll do is
call the main function
so that the control will go back to the
main menu
and also we have to create the default
case
in the default case we'll simply print a
message saying that wrong choice please
try again
so we'll use slash t slash d slash d
wrong choice
please try again
after that
we'll call the forgot function
so that the user can try again with the
correct option
all right so
we forgot to save this
so let's name it as
register. cpp
and save it
now let's try to run this
go to execute and compile and run
there is some error
all right so it must i must be capital
as we have declared
let's try again
so as you can see welcome to login page
this is the menu and this is press 1 to
log in press 2 to register press 3 if
you forgot your password press 4 to exit
so now we will enter our choice first of
all we need to register so we'll write 2
and our username as
sam
at the rate email
this is a username
and now our password
sam
123 is our password
so as we can see the message
registration is successful
after that we will login
as we have registered now we'll try to
log log in
sam address email is our username
and sam
123r
her password so as you can see your
login is successful
thanks for logging in
now let's say i forgot my password
so i'll press three as
if you forgot your password you have to
press three
so
there's a message you forgot the
password no worries please
press one to search your id by your
username so i'll press one
now i'll write my username the last
username i remembered
sam at the rate
email
so your account is found your password
is this as you can see
so let's say
again if i forgot the password and by
chance
i write
sammy
at the rate email
then sorry your account is not found is
displayed as sam at the rate email is
the registered customer and not sammy at
the right email so it will display this
message that sorry your account is not
found
and let's say again if we try to
press let's say five
then we can see that please select from
the options given above actually we have
to make it below options given below
but we can do that
else everything is working fine so now
we will click on exit that is 4
and this is the message thank you
so as you can see this is our
registration and login
system in c plus and this is how we can
do it we have created these three
functions that is login function
then there is registration function
after that there is a forgot function if
we forgot the password and the code is
pretty easy and not that much long so
you can try this code on your own so in
this session we will learn how to create
a supermarket billing project in c plus
we will create this project in small
parts as there are various functions
that we will be creating for this
project
like the add function to add the goods
and products in the market and delete
function to delete some products etc
also we will create a buyer site where
the buyer can buy the products or food
items of his choice
now we will move to our code editor that
is devc plus
so now let's create a new file
and we'll start with
adding the header files first of all
we'll add hash include iostream
then we'll include the fstream file
right hash include f stream because
here we have to do the file handling
operations as well so we'll add the
stream file
now we'll write the namespace standard
now let's save this one and name it
billing 1 dot cpp
all right so we have named this file
now first of all we'll create a class
and we will declare some variables and
functions
so let's create a class and name the
class as
shopping
inside the class shopping first of all
inside the private scope
we will create or declare some variables
p
code then
float type
price
then another variable discount of load
type
then
name which should be string
all right let's name it p name
p stands for product
all right
now inside the public scope we will
declare the functions
so
let's name this function as menu
because we have to create the menu then
administrator function
all right now let's create a buyer
function
a buyer customer whatsoever
all right
now let's create add function
then the edit function
these definitions of these functions we
will create later first of all here we
are declaring these functions
after that we have to remove some
products for that we will create remove
function
and then the list function to display
the list
and at last
recept function
all right so here we have declared the
functions and the variables
so now we'll put semicolon in the end of
the class
and we'll start with the first function
that is the menu function
so we'll write void
class name
then the scope resolution operator
and
menu function
so now inside this function
first of all we will create a
variable
that is choice
and
some more variables like let's say
email
and password
because here we will need
email as well as password for the login
purpose
so now we have to create this menu and
for that we have to first of all display
supermarket main menu and after that we
will display that administrator buyer
etc and
all that so now let's start with that
for that we have to display
and
you can display in your own style
like i usually do like this
slash t to add some horizontal space
it's just for formatting
and
after that same will do
to save some time let's just copy and
just paste it
and but now we'll here we'll write
supermarket
main menu
reduce some space
all right now similarly we'll do here
now let's just copy and paste this part
all right now again some space
all right now we'll create a menu in
which the user have to select the
customer have to select
whether he is an administrator or a
buyer
so let's do that
and for that
write c out
slash d slash d slash d to add some
horizontal space
and
all right now
administrator
now similarly here we will do for
we'll add some space over here
just remove this one
in number two will write buyer
the person who wants to buy stuff
from the market
all right
now
let's format it
we'll add some space over here
now in number three we'll write exit
all right it's pretty much done
after that again if we want to add some
space we can
add some
it's just for formatting purposes you
can do it in your own way
and after that
we have to display a message saying that
please select
so we'll display message
forgot to use semicolon
now we'll take an input from the user
that
whatsoever he wants to click on like if
he is an administrator he'll click on
one if he's a buyer then he'll click on
two and if he wants to exit he can click
on three
so we will take an input of choice
now we have to use switch case
and let's create that
switch and inside this will write choice
we all know how switch case works
all right now for case 1 that is
administrator case
we will ask the user to enter the login
credentials if he or she is an
administrator
so let's just do that
so first of all we'll display a message
saying that please login
so slash d slash d
enter email and then
we'll take the input of email we already
declared this variable
email and
now
we'll take the password from the user
now we will take the input of the
password so as we have taken the email
and password from the user now we will
set an email and password that only
admin knows and no other person can
enter that
and let's say
for that we have to use if else
statements
so
if
email
equals
now let's set the email first of all
robbie at the rate email.com
you can write the email and password as
of your choice
and i'll set the password now as
robbie at the rate one two three
now inside the if block
if the user enters this
that means it is the administrator
and we will call this administrator
function
all right
now in the else block
we'll simply display a message saying
that invalid username password
invalid username
invalid email password
all right after that we'll use the break
to end the case
now we will create case 2 case 2 is for
the buyer so we'll write case
and in this case we'll simply call the
buyer function
so this is the case 2 and now we have to
create the case 3.
inside the case 3
case 3 is for exit so we'll do exit 0
it means successful termination of the
program
now
default case
so inside the default case will simply
display a message saying that
please select from the given options
default case will execute if a person
selects any other option
rather than one two three
so we'll have to instruct him
that please select from the given option
select from the
given options
now
after this we'll use a go to statement
after the switch statement
so go to is a jump statement
so it will help us in jumping to the
main menu again
after the completion of this switch case
and
this m is a label we have to put this
label at the starting of this
menu
so let's do that
right m
now coming back to the next function
so this function is done
so we'll close this function
all right so now we will create an
administration function in which there
will be different
options inside the administrator menu
so now let's start with that so we will
write
void
shopping that is the class name
stroke resolution operator
administrator
so our function name is administrator
so inside this function
first of all we will declare variable
choice
now after that
we will create a menu in which there
will be different options
so
let's do that
first of all we'll write slash n
then slash d
some horizontal spaces
so that
administrator
menu
all right
after that
here will be our first option
so first of all we'll write slash and
then slash these
just to make it bit fancy we can do this
add the product
so the user can select this option if he
wants to
add the product not user the
administrator
now we will add some space in this one
now again same
we'll copy it from here then paste it
so here we will change it to the
modified product
modify the product and
we have to adjust it as well
all right now again we'll add some space
we can copy this one
now
here we write delete the product
now here
again three and make this four
four will be off back to main menu
all right
now after that we will ask the user to
please enter your choice
so we'll display a message saying that
please enter your
choice
all right
now the user
will enter the choice
now again we have to use the switch
case statements
inside this
first case first of all we'll
make and inside this first case we will
call the add function
after that we'll use break statement
now we'll create case 2.
in case 2 we will call the modify
function or the edit function
so we'll write
edit
and again the break
now
will create case 3
in case 3
there will be delete function
so we'll name this function as remove
rem stands for remove
now case 4 would be back to main menu
so for that
we'll simply call the menu function
now after case 4 there would be default
case
so we'll write default
and we'll print a message saying that
invalid choice
all right so
after the switch case statement again as
we have done in the previous function
we will mark
m with the go to statement which is a
jump statement and label it over here
all right so administrator function is
done
after this function now we will create
another function
let's say buyer function
so
for that
void shopping
scope resolution operator
buyer
all right
so inside this buyer function first of
all
we'll declare the variables
in choice
now inside this function will ask the
user that he or she wants to buy the
product or go back so let's create that
first of all here we'll write
by the product no first of all we'll
write buyer
yeah
after that
let's get some space
now
first would be
my product
now there is some space let's copy it
and paste it over here
and
space
[Music]
all right so these are some options
after that we will ask the user to enter
your choice
then the user will enter his choice
so we are taking the input
after that
we'll use the switch statement
and
choice
so inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create case one
[Music]
inside this case
we will call
the receipt function
inside the recept function all the
operations of the buyer will take place
so this is the receipt function and
after that we'll use break
now we'll create case 2
in case 2 will write
or call the menu function as
2 would be go back as you can see
now default case
write invalid choice
now after this again we'll use the go to
jump statement
and mark here m
all right so after this function
now we will create the add function
so as we know if the user over here
the administrator over here will click
on this add the product that is the
first
case then this add function will be
called so now we will create this add
function
so we'll write void
shopping
at
so inside this function we will use some
file handling operations
so
create an object of fstream class
so data is the name of the object
now we'll create some variables like in
c
and
token equals zero
and
float
p
float
d
and
string n
so these are the variables that we have
declared now we have to create a menu
kind of a structure in which we will ask
the user to enter the product code of
product the name of the product price
discount etc
so let's do that
so let's write
add new
product
all right after that we will write the
product code of product we'll ask the
user to enter the product code of the
product
so we'll write slash and slash in and on
slash d
we'll
take the input in p code we have already
declared these variables at the top of
our code
now
we will write
another message saying that name of the
product
for that i'll write
name
of the product
now we will take the input
in pname
now we'll display
price of the product
we'll take the input in price
now we'll ask to enter the discount
so we'll write
discount of the
discount on the product
all right so
here we are asking the user to enter the
product code of the product then the
user will enter the product code then
the name of the product then he will
enter the name
then the price and then the discount
so after that
now we will have to open a file
because as this add option is being used
by the administrator so we have to store
these product details inside a
particular file so that we can display
to the user that we have these products
in our supermarket
all right so for that
we'll have to use the file handling
operations
data is the name of the object as you
can see
and with the help of data.open
we can open the file
and
the name of the file we can write here
database
dot txt
all right
after that
we want
to open this file in reading mode
ios in will open the file in reading one
and ios out will open the file in
writing mode
so now
we will use if statement and will write
if not
data that is if this file
doesn't exist
then
inside this function will write
data dot open
database dot txt
we will open this basically we will open
this file in writing mode if this file
doesn't exist
and if this file exists then in else
block will do that
ios out
ios app stands for append mode and io
sound out stands for write mode
now
in order to write inside the file
we'll give some space and
now we'll write
p code
this is how we can write inside a file
after that p name
then again some space
after that there is price
then again some space after that
this for discount
then we'll
use slash n
all right so after that we have to close
the file as well right data.close
data.close after that
in else block
that is if the file exists
then
we will read from the file so this is
how we can read from file
and
p
these are the variables here we are
initializing the file because after that
we have to use the while loop to iterate
through the file
so let's do that
first of all i'll write this part and
then i'll explain
inside this we'll use if statement
and
if c equals to p code
then
token will be incremented
and
for
initialization
or for iteration
we'll again do that
so here what we are doing is first of
all we are initializing the index of
file here we are initializing the index
because after that we will use the while
loop inside this while loop
we have written
not data dot eof this eof is the end of
file function
this while loop will make sure to check
every content of the file
by iterating it so one by one each
content of the file is checked if the
code matches with the p code that is if
there is a duplicacy then
the token variable which we have
we can see initialize with 0 will be
incremented
it will become 1 basically after that
for the iteration purpose we are reading
from the file
and after that now
we will close the file
data dot close
all right
now
we'll use if statement that if token
is one as we know
if token gets incremented that is
if there is a duplicacy
then again
it will go back to the menu
that is if the product code entered
by the administrator already exist then
he have to enter another product code
because if
the administrator enters the duplicate
code then it will again go back to this
menu
so this go to m
we have to label it over here
all right now in the else block
that is
if
the token value is not incremented
that is the product code entered by the
administrator is unique and not
duplicate then we can enter the prod
the product that is its product code its
product name its price
so for that we can just copy paste this
part
it's the same
and
we can paste it over here
so here we are writing inside the file
so this is how we can write inside the
file and here we are opening the file in
append and writing mode
to write inside the file we have to open
the file in writing mode
so after that
we will display a message saying that
record inserted
there's some bracket error the else
block will close over here
all right
now this add function is done
we have done this part
now we have to create another function
named the edit function
as the add function is used for adding
the products in the market
based on their price
names discounts etc now edit function
will edit the products like if you want
to edit some product like
choose instead of milk or something like
that you can do it with the help of edit
function so we'll do that functionality
in edit function
so let's do that
we'll write void shopping
edit the name of the function
so inside this function we will create
two objects
of fstream class
that is data1 and data2
that is data and data1
alright
so these two are the objects of fstream
class
now we will
declare some variables
or string n
all right
now we'll write
a message displaying modify the record
so write slash in
now we will ask
to enter the product code
so we'll write
now we will open the file and check if
that file exists or not
now
if
that file doesn't exist
then
we'll simply display a message
saying that file doesn't exist
and in else block
we will open the file
but not the same file the other file
this
file would be database 1 and we will
open this file with the help of this
object that is datavan
so we'll write
data one dot open
the name of the file would be
database
one dot txt
and we will open this file
in
band mode
and
writing mode
so here what we are doing is we will
save our edited data in this file and we
will rename it to the original name that
is
database.txt
the name of this file is database1.ext
we will save the edited data in this
file and then
we will rename this file as database.txt
that is the original name of the file
so now we will write
data
p code
then p name
price
and then
this
so we are initializing this file
basically we want to iterate this file
so
not data dot end of file
it will check each and every content of
the file
all right now
using if statement
we will check if p key equals to p code
p key is the code that is entered by the
administrator
which
he wants to edit
so if that matches
then inside the file
write slash n
slash t slash t
then product
of
new code
product new code
here we are asking the administrator to
enter the new code for the
product
so
cnc
he or she will enter the code then we
will ask
to enter the name
so write slash and slashing
name of the
product
p name
and
now the
price so we'll write
now the discount
now all the updated details of the
product will be entered with the help of
data1 object
again some space
then
and
again some space
and here p
then here
d
all right
now
we'll write
a message saying that record edited
record edited all right
after that we'll increment the token
that is token plus plus
now
this was the if block now in else block
gain data one
that is if
the product key for the product code
entered by the administrator doesn't
matches with
any of the product code within the file
then
the old variables that
is p code
p name
price
and after that discount
that is this
all right after that
yeah
we'll do that slashing
now outside this else block we'll write
that
p code p name
just for increment purpose
we want the while loop to iterate so
that is why we will use this one
so that this while loop can iterate
all right after this
we will close both the objects that is
data
dot close we are closing both the files
and data1
dot close
now as i already discussed that we have
to rename that database 1 back to the
original name that is database so we
will use two
functions in c plus
that is remove function and rename
function with the help of remove
function we will remove the list that is
the database.txt file we will remove the
database.txt file and then with the help
of rename function we will rename
database1.ext to database dot txt
so let's do that
remove inside remove we will write the
name of the file
it will basically remove all the list
inside the file
all right now rename function
inside the rename function first of all
we have to write the old name
that is database
one dot txt
then the new name
that is database
dot txt
so now
using this function
this name will be changed to database
dot txt
all right
now
if
token value is not incremented
or we can say is zero
then
it will display a message saying that
record not
found
sorry
and with that we are done with the
edit function
and now we will create
remove function
so we'll write
void
shopping
rem remove
this remove function will be bit similar
to that of the edit function
so now let's start with that
f stream
will create two
objects
data and data one
now
hint p key
and
into token
we'll initialize it with zero
now
we'll display
slash d
delete
product
now
will display
to enter the product code so we'll write
similar to previous function
now data dot open
database
dot txt
we are opening this file
in reading mode
and then we will check
if this file exists or not so write
so here we will write
if
not
data
then inside will display
file doesn't exist
all right
now in else block
inside the else block we will open the
data1 file
and the file name would be database one
dot txt
and we will open this file
in append and writing mode
all right now after that
the sp code to initialize or iterate
the while loop
we will write this
this is how we read from the file
and here we will use data because we
will
iterate through data.eof
that is data file
now inside the while loop
again we'll do the same as that we have
previously done
data dot eof end of file
now
use if
p code
equals to
p key
then
will simply display the message saying
that
product
deleted
successfully
all right and now we will increment the
token
now in the else block we will write
data one
space
then p code
then p name then price then discount
now
rename
then
price
then discount
here the p key entered by the
administrator will check for the first
product code if it matches the if block
executes
in the second iteration it will not
match and else block will execute and
database 1 file will be displayed
in other words in else block all the
products will be displayed except the
one which you want to remove or delete
so we will show this file database 1 and
then rename it with the previous one
that is database
all right so now let's go ahead
we'll do the same in order to white rate
this while loop
now
as we've done previously
data don't close as we have to close the
files
data one
dot close
and after that again the remove function
to remove the database file
and rename function
firstly we will write the database 1
that is the old name
make sure to put semicolons then
database
then
database
dot txt the new name
all right after that if
tokens is not incremented
that is if token is zero
then it will simply
display a message
saying that record
cannot found
or record not found
so as we have created three major
functions
now we will create another function
named list
it will help us in showing the list to
the customer or the buyer all right
shopping
now i will write
list
inside this function
write
the data
the object of the stream class
then data dot open
will open the database file
dot txt
in the
reading mode
all right after that
we will format it a bit
after that again
we have to write the product number name
price etc so we'll write
product number
and then
we can use slash d
again name
then
price
and then we'll use lesson
please put them inside the double quotes
and now again we'll copy this part
you can design it in your own way
and
now we can do
the reading part
data
p code
then name
as we have done previously
price
this
while loop inside the while loop again
we'll use
not data
dot eof
now inside this file we'll write the
product code
product name and the price we'll start
with product code
then
product name
that is p name
after that
price
for the iteration purpose we'll write
again p code
p name
price
discount
all right now after that we will close
the file by writing data dot
close
all right so we are done with this
function as well after this now we will
create the recept function in which all
the customer operations will take place
so now let's create this
recept function so we'll write void
shopping
r e c i p t recept
and now inside this function first of
all we'll create
the object of f stream class
then we'll declare some arrays because
we have to store multiple product keys
and multiple quantities of those
products
so that is why here we have to use
arrays
and then we'll declare some
variables so let's start
first of all f stream class the object
of this class is
data
now after this we'll create
array
array c means array of codes
so i'll declare it in that way
now after that
now we'll declare another array array of
q that is quantity
now
choice variable
then there would be
a counter variable let's say
then discount variable
will initialize it with zero
and we'll initialize amount with zero as
well
all right now
total variable
now we will display a message
saying that
receipt so that the user will know that
this is the recept
now after that we will open a file
that is data.open will open the
database.txt file and then we'll check
if that file or database exist or not
so
we have done this previously data.open
database
dot
txt will open this file in
reading mode
now we'll use
if block and inside this if block will
write not data we are checking that if
this file or database exists or not
all right
if it doesn't exist if not data that is
if this file doesn't exist or this
database doesn't exist then we will
print the message saying that
empty database
empty with a p
now as this
now in else block we'll write if that
file exists
then first of all we'll close the file
that we already opened
now in else block we will call this
list function that we have created
because if the file is created then we
have to call the list function and
will show the user or the customer that
these are the products available in the
supermarket
and for that we are calling this list
function
now we will
design the structure and ask the user to
place the order
so let's do that
please place the order
now again we'll copy this part
all right so now
we'll use
do while loop
the purpose of using this do-while group
is that we have to run a specific part
of the code every time and
the other part of the code we have to
run based on the choice
so now let's start with that
inside the do
block
first of all we will
ask the user
to enter the product code and enter the
product quantity
so first of all
we'll write
product code
enter product code
we'll take the input in the array
now we'll ask the user
to enter
the quantity
all right now
we'll take the product quantity let us
see in
a r r
q
see
now
we will check that
if the product code entered by the user
matches with the product code
that is being already entered then we
will display a message saying that
duplicate product code please try again
so for that we have to use the for loop
first of all and inside the for loop
we'll initialize i with 0
i less than
c we have already initialized c with
zero
now
i plus plus
so inside this
for loop use if condition and check if
the
product key or product code entered by
the user matches with
the product code that already exist in
the file then we will display a message
saying that duplicate product code so
we'll
write
if
a c of
c that is entered by the user
equals array of c
i
so i will keep on iterating as we have
used for loop
so inside this if we will display a
message saying that
duplicate product code
please
please try again
all right
now
we'll write go to m
again jump statement as we have already
discussed
now after this
we will increment c plus plus that is
if the product
key is not duplicate then c will
increment that is the counter will
increment
all right now
we will display a message saying that do
you want to buy another product or not
right
all right so as we have displayed this
now we will take the input of the user
see in choice that whether he wants to
buy the product or not
so this is our do loop
now we'll have to use after this do
block we'll have to use while loop as
we're using the do while loop
now here is the condition that if the
user will press yes that is y
then
this loop will execute
all right
now
we'll make a design structure so we'll
write c out
and slash and slash and slash t slash t
slash t
and now we'll write receipt
all right now after that
now we'll write product number
sorry by mistake we write
capital n now we'll write product number
then now we'll write product quantity
product name sorry
now
product quantity
then the price
now we'll use the for loop to iterate
through the file so we'll write
4 into i equals 0 i less than c i plus
plus
so now inside this for loop first of all
because we have to do the iteration we
will open the file data.open
database
double quotes database dot txt
and will open this file in reading mode
so ios
in
alright so after that
we will kind of initialize this file
we'll write p code
p name
then
price
after that there was discount
all right
now as we have done previously while
not
data dot eof that is end of file
and inside this while loop we will check
we are actually matching if the code
entered by the user that is ar r c i is
equal to the code present in the file
and if so then we will do the
calculations and add those file in the
customer basket
so let's do that p code equals
array of c of i
here we are
checking if so
then
we'll do the amount amount equals to
price of the product into the quantity
of the product
all right after that we'll have to do
the discount part
so in this part we know that
the discount is calculated by
multiplying amount with discount divided
by 100
and then we have to subtract it from the
amount
so let's do that amount minus
amount
into
discount
divided by 100
all right
now after that as we are done now we'll
have to add discount to the total
variable
because in this part the total amount
after getting discount is stored in this
disk variable now we will add this
variable to the total variable
all right so as this is done now we will
print this part so in this part we are
just printing so we'll
do the slashing and now
then p code
then p name
then
array of qo5
array of q
i
all right now after that price
then amount
amount after discount or will write
discount only
because we have to write the variable
all right now we will have to add the
slashed is in between them
so let's do that part
all right so we have added the slash t's
in between them for the formatting
purpose now to iterate the file for that
rating purpose we'll do the same
that p code
p name
price
discount
all right now
after this while loop
now we will have to close the data file
so we'll write
data dot close
so after this data don't close we have
to print the total amount so let's do
that first of all we'll do some
designing part like let's say selection
slash in
now
just for design purpose
i will simply print the total variable
will write first of all total amount
now the variable
total
all right so everything is done except
the main function now in the main
function
we'll write
so int main
now inside this main function as we know
we have created the class shopping class
so we will create the object of that
shopping class and we will call
the menu function with the help of that
object as we know that is the first
function that must be called so we'll
write shopping
and let's say the object of this is
s
and s dot
menu function
so as we know the menu function is the
top most function
so this
menu will display when we run the file
so now everything is done
and now let's run this file
let's press compile and run
i hope it works
[Music]
there are some errors
all right so 335 okay
so this is the error and now
57 line
line number 57
yeah we have to use double equal to
and
one more error is there i think
now let's try to run this
there might be some more errors
as you can see
all right after this 386
okay so we haven't labeled this one
we have to label m
now let's try to run this
so here we can see supermarket main menu
first is administrator
then second if you are a buyer three to
exit
so first we'll login as an administrator
so as you can see please login
so now we'll enter the admins
email
so we'll write
robbie
at the rate
email
dot com
now the password
robbie address one two three
now this is the administrator menu as
you can see first is the add product if
you want to add the product second to
modify the product three to delete the
product and four to back to main menu
so now i'll click on
like i want to add the product so i'll
write
one i'll press one and
enter add new product so now i have to
add product code of the product
like let's say the product of code of
product is one
name of group product let's say juice
and price is
70
and discount on product is
2
record inserted
now again
i want to add
so i'll click on one product code of
product would be two
now name of product would be let's say
bread
price
30
discount again to
record inserted now again product now
would be
let's say butter
three
butter
price of product would be sixty
discount would be four
now fourth product
sorry add product now product could be
fourth
and this would be
let's say x
price would be 170
discount
three percent
record inserted so now we will check
that these records are inserted or not
so we can cross check it by
going here and open this database file
so as we can see one juice
product code one is juice
price is 70 2 is the discount
then second is bread third is butter
four is egg so first this is the product
code this is the price and this is the
discount on that product
now let's come back and modify the
product
let's say first product was juice
and we want to modify that product
so what we'll do is we'll add the
product code 1 and the new product code
would be
1 only let's say we don't want to change
that
and name of the product would be
chips
we'll replace it with chips
price would be
20
and discount would be two percent
so record edited as we can see
here record edited
and now we can check
so now we'll open this database file so
as you can see
as you can see one chips
two bread three butter four eggs so the
first product that was juice is replaced
by chips
so this function is done now let's try
the delete function
we'll click on 3 for delete
and now
we have to enter the product code of the
product which we want to delete so let's
say we want to read the fourth product
and we can see product deleted
successfully we can check that
as you can see
there are three products left the fourth
one got deleted
so now let's go back and let's check if
the customer wants to buy the product
how can he or she buy so let's first of
all click on phone to go back to them
so now let's click on two as a buyer to
buy some products
now we'll click on one to buy the
product
so as you can see our products are chips
bread and butter
so product numbers are one two 3 and
their price at 20 30 60 respectively
and now we'll enter the product code of
the product which we want to buy so i'll
click on one
and the quantity i say
2
want to buy another product or not they
are asking if you want to buy another
product if yes then press y and if no
then press n
so we'll click on why because we want to
buy another product
so now i'll click on 2 that is bread
product quantity i'll add product
quantity as four breads
and now butter so for that first of all
why
for butter i will click on three
product code of butter is three now
quantity would be two
now
i don't want to buy any other product so
i'll click on n
so as you can see
product numbers product name their
quantity price amount and amount with
discount
and the total is there that is 272
and if we wish to buy another product so
we can click on one else we can click on
two to go back
so this is our recept our total amount
is there
so this is our complete project on
supermarket billing in c plus you can
try it although the code is bit long
approx 400 to 450 lines of code
but it is worth trying this project will
allow a user to book a flight to a
particular country and he or she will
receive the ticket by filling in all the
important details
different concepts of c plus will be
used in making this project which will
help you in understanding the concepts
of c
in a practical manner
so now let's go ahead
so now let's go to our code editor that
is dev c plus plus
so this is our code editor and now let's
create a new file
and let's start with it
so let's add some header files
hash include
iostream
now we will add another header file that
is f stream
for file handling operations
now hash include
i o manip
so this header file is used for floating
point values so now we'll add the
standard namespace
now we'll write the main function
now inside this main function we will
create an object of a class
our class name is management
and
the object name would be
m obj
so that returns 0
now we have to create this class
so we'll write
class
management
and inside this class
we will make a constructor because we
have created the object of this class so
constructor would be called and inside
that constructor we will call the
function
so let's do that first of all we'll
write the public scope
now under this public scope we'll write
management
so this is our constructor management
and inside this constructor we will call
a function let's say the name of the
function is main menu
all right
so now the class ends so we'll write the
semicolon in the end
now inside this function
main menu we have to create a menu
that will display on the screen and also
we have to use this function
many times inside this
program so we have to declare this
function globally so we'll write
void
mean
menu
so this is the function prototype
now after that
we can create this function
so let's write
void
main menu
and
now we'll declare some variables
l choice
and s choice
and another variable let's say back
now we have to create a layout or a
structure for a menu
so let's do that
slash t
airlines
you can write any name as of your choice
now we will write main menu
write slash t
now again we'll add some space
for some lines
let's add slash d
now we will create a structure in which
we'll ask the user to press a particular
button to open a particular
functionality like press want to open
the customer details press 2 for flight
registration
press 3 for ticket and charges
so let's do that
now i'll copy paste
i'll copy this part and paste it over
here
and second one will write press 2
for flight registration
so we are done with the layout now we'll
take the input from the user
so let's do that
now we'll write l choice the variable
that we have declared
now for all three of them we'll make a
separate classes that is for customer
details we'll make a detailed class for
flight registration we'll make a
registration class for ticket and
charges will make a ticket class
and to to call the functions of these
classes we'll have to make the object of
these classes
so let's do that
so we'll write
details
d
d is the object name
registration
r r is the object name
ticket is the class name t is the object
name so we have created these objects
d r and t
now we'll use a switch statement
a switch case statement
and now we'll write
l choice
now inside the switch case first of all
we'll create a case one
now inside this case we'll
have to call a function of detail class
so let's do that but before that we'll
write
see out
customers
so that it looks nice now we'll call the
function let's say the name of the
function is information
and now
we'll ask the user
to press one to go back to the main menu
like if the user wants to go back to the
main menu
after filling the details or something
like that
then
he or she can click on this one button
all right now we'll take the input
back this is the variable that we have
declared
now
if
back equals 1
then
we'll call the main menu function
that is the main menu will display
and also in else block will do the same
we'll call this function only
and here we'll write
press any
key to go back to main menu
now
here we'll do the break
case one ends
now we have to create a case two
case two is for flight registration so
we'll simply
display a message and call the function
we'll write
book a
flight
using this system
all right after that we'll use slash n
and handle
all right now we'll call this function r
dot flights
r is the name of the object
and flights is the name of the function
that we will create afterwards
now we'll write
break
now we'll have to create case three
now case raise for ticket collection
now all we need to do is to display a
message saying that get your ticket
all right now we'll use slash n
now we'll call the function
t is the object name bill is the name of
the function
let's say
now
we'll display a message saying that your
ticket is printed
you can get it
or you can collect it
now we'll write press 1 to display your
ticket
we'll take the input and
if back equals to one
then
inside if condition
will call this function
display
t is the object name displays a function
now after that we'll display a message
press 1 to go back to main menu
or press any key to go back to main menu
so we'll write
press
ending key to go
back
to main menu
all right now after that we'll take the
input of this
and if back equals to
1
then we'll write
main menu that is we call this menu
function
and in else
we gone
again we will call this menu function
to display the menu
right after this
break to end the case
closing bracket and now here is the
starting bracket
all right so now we have to create a
case for
inside case 4 first of all we'll display
a message saying that see out thank you
because in case 4 as you can see
press 4 to exit so
if a user press 4 will display a message
saying that
this is slash inflation and then again a
slash t
now thank you message will be displayed
after that endl
no now we'll write break
and after that
there would be a default case
now in this default case a message would
be displayed like
invalid input or something like that
right
invalid input
please try
again
right after that we'll use slash n and
handle
now
to go back to main menu
so that the user can try once again so
we'll call this function main menu
now after that
break
now we have to create classes like first
of all we have to create this
detail class in which we are calling the
information function
so this is the information function and
now let's create its class that is class
detail
so let's do it
class
details
now in the public scope
you will declare some variables
and
static
string
name
and let's say gender
both of these would be string
and
now after that let's create the variable
phone number
and
gender
not gender age we have already created
gender
now age would be integer
then there is
address we'll write add
then there is another variable
static and
customer id
so let's see id
now
an array we have to create
let's give it hundred
now let's create this function
information
so inside this information function
first of all we'll ask the user to enter
the customer id
so
slash n
enter the customer
id
after that
now the user will enter the customer id
c
i d
as you can see
now
will ask the user
to enter the name
then the name variable
then we'll ask the user to enter the
edge
then there is address
after that there would be
gender
now once the user has entered all these
details then we'll display a message
saying that
your details are saved with us
so we'll write your
details are saved
with us
[Music]
all right so we have to end the class
over here so we'll use semicolon
now we'll create another class
now we will create the registration
class but before that we have to use
some of the variables of the detailed
class in the ticket class
so for that
we'll write in detail
scope resolution operator
c
id
this is the variable that we want to use
then the name variable
write string
name
then that variable gender
so write string
all right so now we can create this
class
so let's do this right class
registration
and now inside this class first of all
we'll declare some variables under the
public scope
we'll write
we'll declare a static variable
choice
then
another variable that is choice one
let's say
then
another variable back
then
a static float variable
named charges
all right
so these are the variables now we have
to create the function flights that we
have called from the main menu function
so this is the flight function now
inside this flight function
there is a character array
named flight n
now after that
inside this array we'll put the name of
the countries as the elements so let's
start
first of all is dubai
after that there is
canada
then let's say another one is
uk
then there is
usa
after that there would be australia
then let's say europe
all right now
using a for loop we will display each of
these countries one by one
so
we'll write int a equals zero
a less than
[Music]
six
a plus plus
now inside this for loop
we'll write
a plus one
dot
flight
two
so here what we are doing is
this a plus one that is zero plus one so
dubai will be displayed then one by one
canada uk us australia all of these
will get displayed and now after that
we'll write
flight n
and l
now
all these countries will be displayed to
the user
so now the user have to select a country
so first of all we'll write
welcome
to the
airlines
then
and
after that
will ask the user to press the number of
the country of which you want to book
the flight
so we'll write
press the number
so we'll take the input from the user
see in choice
now after that
we'll use switch statements all right
switch
inside we'll write
choice
and now we'll make some cases
case one will be of dubai case two will
be of canada then uk us australia and
then europe
so let's start with dubai
so we'll display a message
will write welcome to dubai myricks
all right now slashing
now again we'll display a message saying
that
your comfort
is our priority
enjoy the journey
now
we'll display following are the flights
following
are
the flights
all right so now
we'll display first flight so i'll write
this is the name of the flight and now
and l and now we have to display also
that
the timing and the date of the flight
and how many hours will it take and the
price so let's do that
so here we'll write
slash d
then we'll write
the date
after that the timing
there is 10 hours flight
group is 14 000 let's say
similarly
let's copy and paste
let's say there are three flights
that are going to dubai
and
let's change the model numbers
[Music]
58
and the time
and the date also
all right
so these are the flights now we will
ask the user to select the flight
all right
select the flight you want to book
[Music]
see in choice one
now if the user chooses one
then we have to create the condition
you can use the switch case or you can
do
if else as well
so let's start if choice one
equals equals one
that is if the user or the customer
chooses the first flight flight then
charges will assign
the
flight charges
like 14 000
and
display a message
saying that you have successfully booked
the flight
[Music]
you can go back to menu and take the
ticket
will display this message
so this is our if statement
now we have to create else if statement
as well
for the condition we'll write if choice
one
equals equals two
then what we'll do is
let's just copy and paste to save time
we can copy this part and paste it over
here
charges as we know the charges of this
light is ten thousand
it will write ten thousand
and its number was
658
all right similarly
for the third flight as well we'll do
the same
the charges was 9000
so let's do that
the number was 498
we have to change this one
let's say 508
so that the flight numbers are unique
now in else block
we'll write invalid input shifting to
the previous menu
so we'll simply display that
and then we will call the flights
function
after that
if the user wants to go back to the main
menu so we'll display a message for that
press any key to go back to the main
menu
[Music]
if the user chooses one that is if back
equals equals one
then the main menu function would be
called
and same otherwise
similarly we will create case 2
so let's do that
in case two we'll just copy and paste
this one to save some time
all right the changes we have to do is
welcome to canadian
airlines
and now your comfort is our priority
it's all right following are the flights
so
the modern number and number of flights
we have to change
let's say
and the timings like
and the dates and time
it's
2 pm
you can change that as per your choice
you can do whatsoever you want
20 hours
then select the flight you want to book
then similarly in the first flight was
of 24 000.
ca198
and if you choose 2 then there would be
29 000.
forty thousand
the rest is all good shifting to the
previous menu as we have done previously
and now again
after this else
we can create
case 3.
so inside this case 3 we'll write
welcome to
uk airways so right
so now let's say to uk there are only
two flights
let's say they are only one flight
to uk
all right
uk
and its flight number is 798 let's say
and the timings are
and date is first of all 12
and the timing is 10 am
and it will take around 14 hours
14 hours and 44 000
rupees
select the flight you want to book
this is same
and here i have to change 44 000
all right so to uk there is only one
flight so we not need to create this
health if statements
so we can just cut it
and in else block the rest is same
so now after that
we have to create case three
sorry case four
and we can copy and paste this one as
well
so our fourth flight was of
us that is u.s airbase
all right now we will change the name
right
us567
and
the dates
it's a choice
assign it 39 000 here and
there is 42 000
after this
now case 5 would be of australian
airlines so we'll write case
5
and copy paste this part
and here we'll write
australian
airlines
so let's change we'll write
yes
and
698
timing date would be
18.
nine
forty four thousand
[Music]
so all right else everything is done in
this part
now we'll create case six
in case six
all we need to change is
welcome to dubai migrates and
we'll change it to european airlines
european airlines then will change its
name to
eu
498 instead of 198.98
and the date let's say 2
time is 2 am
18 hours of flight and its price is 36
000.
31 000
10 am and
all right now we have to change its
model number as well
all right so you
898
and its price is 36 000.
its price is 37 000.
all right rest everything is done in
this part
now let's create the default case
all right
in the default case we will write
invalid input
please
no shifting to the main menu
and then we will call this main menu
function
i will write break
and close the switch statements
all right so this registration function
is done
it's pretty long as we have created six
cases
of all the countries named
dubai canada uk us australia europe
now only one function is
or class is left that is ticket class
so let's create this ticket class
all right so now after this registration
class we'll have to use the semicolon
so
now before this ticket class
we need to know that we have to use some
variables of registration class
and the details class in this ticket
class so we will do the multiple
inheritance
and before that
let's do the same thing as we did
earlier
road registration because we have to use
these variables
so we'll write
the class name then scope resolution
operator
charges
is the variable then another variable
would be
choice
both of these variables is of
registration class so that is why we are
doing this
all right now we will start with the
class ticket
all right class
ticket
then we have to inherit both of these
classes that is we have to use multiple
inheritance right public
registration
and then details
so here we are using the multiple
inheritance because we have to use the
variables of both of these classes in
this class ticket
now in the public scope
we'll start with the function that is
bill
void bill
and now inside this function first of
all we'll
declare a variable named destination
and we'll left it like this because
we have to assign it
a choice that is being made by the
person who wants to travel to the
country
so now off stream as we know is used to
create or write information in the files
the object of is of stream is out f
we have created now
let's say the file is records.txt you
can name it as per your choice
in which the data
of the flights is being stored
now we will write inside this
records.txt file
so as we know to write inside the file
the object name and
then
whatsoever we want to
show inside the file
xyz airlines
take it
details that is class name
scope resolution operator
c id
then nl
similarly we will do that for name and
gender as well
um
now
when it comes to destination as we have
left the empty space
now the user if the user will press
1 then it will go to dubai if if 2 then
canada 3 then uk 4 then uss we'll have
to do that as well
so we'll write if
registration as the class was
registration
scope resolution operator
choice equals equals one
then destination variable
equals
dubai
and
let's copy this part because we have to
use else if statements as well
you can just copy and paste all we need
to do is
else if now we can change it to choice 2
and name to canada
now after that
we'll simply print or write the
destination
so first of all we'll write destination
and then we'll print the
variable
let's do slash t to add some horizontal
space
now
destination variable
all right now
we'll write the flight cost
because it is a variable of registration
class
all right now
we have to close this
object or file out f dot
close
we have closed the file now
we have to display the receipt as well
so for that we have to create another
function within this class only we'll
create void
disk build that is display bin
so inside this function
we will create an if stream class and
its variable let's say would be ifs we
all know it if stream class is used to
read from the file
so we are actually reading here so
we'll write records.txt file
now we'll use the if condition
inside this
so we'll write if
not ifs that if it doesn't exist
then it should show an error that is
let's say
file error
now if the file is there then we'll use
while loop
and we'll check not ifs dot end of file
that is here we are checking the file
till the end that is every content of
the file will check and ifs
dot
get line
array
100
here we have used getline to read the
content from the file and while loop
will help us in doing that after that
we'll print
array and then handle
all right after that we have to close
this file as well
so we'll do that ifs.close
now we have to close the class as well
semicolon
so yeah our code is pretty much done
after this
there was main menu and
the main function
so now let's try to run this one
before that let's save it
and let's name it
as
flight
dot cpp
all right now let's try to run this
there are a few errors
all right so
first error is
this one and
let's check them all
flight dot cpp
66 line 66 there's an error
all right
function name is wrong flight we missed
the t
then
line 466.
in line 466
[Music]
where it is out f
we forgot to write f
we missed the f and then
5 26
this one is associated with the previous
one error that is information error
let's go to 561
t dot display
all right so we wrote the wrong name it
was dis bill
all right now let's try to run this
again
semicolon we forgot
now
as you can see xyz airlines main menu
press one to add the customer details
there's a little bit formatting error
you can figure it out yourself
press one to add customer details press
two for flight registration three for
ticket and charges and photo exit so
let's say a new customer i am so i'll
press one and i'll write customer id
one
now the name of the customer let's say
raj
age of the customer is 23
and address is
chandigarh
all right
now gender is mail
now your details are saved with us
all right now press any key to go back
to the main menu we can press any key
231
then this is the main menu again
now i want to register a flight i'll
press two
so these are the flights fly to dubai
canada uk usa we forgot to add some
space we must add some space over here
so these are the flights to dubai canada
uk us australia europe and welcome to
airlines they are asking
us to press the number of the country of
which you want to book the flight let's
say i want to go to usa
so
four
so these are the flights us 567 u.s 658
us 508
and these are the timings and these are
the dates let's say i want to go to
658 us658 then i'll press 2
so there's a mistake by us we forgot to
change the name of this flight we'll
change this later and now let's go back
to the main menu
now let's say
we know that we have booked this u.s 658
but there was some
writing error way by mistake forgot to
write us 658 over here instead we write
dub
now as we know that we have this flight
that is booked so we want to go for
ticket and charges so we'll click on
three
your tickets a ticket is printed you can
collect it
all right plus one
to display your ticket
as you can see
customer id1 customer name raj mail
description destination usa flight
course 39 000
as we know this is a 39 000 flight
so this is how

As our world becomes
increasingly digitized, so
does our ability to
connect with it.
Imagine if you could search your
surroundings the same way you
search the web.
Using existing cameras and
advances in AI,
we can now find things and
people in the real world,
in real time and take action to
improve safety and well-being.
When a dangerous spill
occurs in a chemical plant,
cameras recognize the incident.
Information about the spill is
instantly shared with the people
who need it the most.
Enabling them to protect other
employees from coming in contact
with the hazard,

And clean it up.

This technology can also help
keep people safer in hospitals.
Patients recovering from heart
surgery are limited to how much
they should exert themselves.
When someone exceeds the
prescribed level of activity,
a nurse is alerted.

What's more,
the location of the closest
wheelchair is identified, so
that the nurse can quickly get
the patient seated and safe.

This technology is also
useful in an environment like
a construction site.
Where people who need
specialized tools are spread
out, sometimes across
multiple floors.
Using cameras already in place,
this technology can
identify a specific tool.
As well as the closest
authorized person who
can deliver it.
Saving everyone time and
keeping the workflow moving.
The digital and physical worlds
are come together to help make
everyone more safe,
secure, and productive.
And we're bringing the Edge of
Microsoft's Cloud to any device.

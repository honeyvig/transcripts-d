hi everyone
today we're going to be talking about
how you can convert a vs code theme to
work in visual studio
we've been on a journey to make visual
studio as flexible as possible so that
you can code the way you want
and now if you're a theme author
you can convert your theme to work in
visual studio so that a wider audience
can get access to your theme
let's get started here are the things
you'll need in order to convert your
theme
i'll note that you'll want visual studio
2022 preview 4 or later
because it has fallback colors which
you'll want just in case the json
doesn't cover that area of the ui
let's navigate to visual studio to
configure our install
i have the.net desktop development
workload
i also have
the visual studio extension development
workload
in components i have net 5 runtime
now i'm ready to go
i'm going to be converting the winter is
coming theme today
i've gone ahead and applied it to my
visual studio code instance
on my keyboard i'm going to press ctrl
shift p to bring up the command palette
i'm going to select generate color
scheme from current settings
this is going to give me all the tokens
inside this theme
that describe the colors
i'm going to save this in a folder that
i previously created
it's going to be a json file not a json
c file
next i'm going to navigate to our
converter tool
this is a free open source converter
tool
and if there's anything you'd like to
see improved you're welcome to create a
pr or
create an issue
i'm going to go ahead and clone this
tool
i'll navigate over to my command line
opened in admin mode
i'm going to clone using the git clone
command
after i clone this tool i'm going to
navigate over to the folder that i've
just created
then i'm going to build the tool
using.net build
next i'm going to navigate into this
folder
i can run the tool using this command
with the flag dash h
this is going to give me instructions on
how to use the tool
i'm going to go ahead and convert my
theme
the flag dash i
is the folder that i've created which
contains my json file
i can convert several themes at once
by including several json files inside
this folder
the flag dash t
is the target visual studio which will
open and patch my theme so that i can
take a look at it
i also have the option of just creating
the package def file without opening
visual studio
after it's loaded
i'm going to navigate to tools
theme
and select my theme
it's going to get applied
there you are winter is coming
next i can package my theme up inside a
v6 in order to upload to the marketplace
or share with friends
i can navigate to file new project or
ctrl shift n
next i'm going to search for v6 and
create an empty v6 project
i'm going to name my project and then
select create
then i'll navigate to properties right
click add
existing item
i'm going to select the package def file
that i've just created this is going to
be in the same output folder as my json
file
i'm going to select all files in order
to see my package def file
once i've selected that it's going to
show up in the tree
i'm going to select the package chef
file and expand the project properties
window
for copy to output directory
i will select copy always
and for include in v6
i will select true
then i'm going to navigate to the v6
manifest
i'll navigate to assets and new
then for type
i'm going to select microsoft visual
dot
for source i'll select file on file
system
and then for path again i'm going to
select the package stuff file that i've
created
and i'll select ok
finally i can adjust the metadata inside
my theme
like my theme name
author and version
now the last step is to build it i'm
going to go ahead and build the
extension
you can see it's working
after i've built the theme
i'll see a v6 file inside my output
folder
i can now upload this theme
to the marketplace
where there are a lot of other great
themes already available
and there you are winter is coming on
the marketplace
if you try the converted tool or if you
try any converted themes we'd love to
know what you think
this process is always iterative always
changing and we're always looking to
improve
thanks everyone

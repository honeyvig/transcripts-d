hi my name is Abel and I'm a senior
cloud developer advocate specializing in
DevOps I am so excited to show you
what's new and Azure DevOps we've always
said Azure devops is everything you need
to take an idea and turn that idea into
a working piece of software in the hands
of your end-users for any language
targeting any platform and now we've
made it even better in the name of the
game has been all about integrating with
github so let's go check it out
alright so here you can see as your
boards where you can track any unit of
work in your software project now
wouldn't it be cool if we could link
Azure boards up with our github repos Oh
guess what now you can and it's as easy
as this if you want to set up that
linkage let's first go into our project
settings and from here we're going to do
some integration integrations with our
boards now the first thing that's going
to ask you is which github repo do you
want to integrate with now I'm gonna go
ahead and use my personal access token
to connect up to my github repo and
let's see if I can remember my token I
think it's that and let's go ahead and
authorize that and now it's going to ask
me which we po do you want to connect to
so let's go ahead and connect up to my
able tailwind
front end so we'll select that we'll
save it and that is all we need to do to
connect up as your boards with my github
repo so let's jump back to our boards
and you can see my Kanban boards
alright so notice I have this super
duper important bug that needs to be
fixed immediately right so it sure would
be cool if the changes that I did inside
my github repo would automatically link
to this work item so I could track all
of my work and you totally can now
because we linked up our Asscher boards
with github so let me show you what I
mean let's jump into github and make a
change so here's a demo comment and
we'll go ahead and save this and when we
save this we'll go ahead and create a
branch to start a pull request so we'll
go ahead and create a new branch and we
do need to leave a good comment so let's
leave a comment that say this fix is as
your bug number and what number was that
I think it was 64 and now let's go ahead
and create that branch for myself to fix
so what am i doing I have now created a
branch with my code fixes now it's ready
to start my pull request now if I jump
back into my add your boards check this
out if we look at the details
don't--don't done BAM there's a change
that I just did inside of github and if
I click on this this is a deep link that
will take me directly inside of github
to see what branch it's in as well as
what my changes are so now let's go
ahead and jump back into github because
what we want to do is we want to create
a pull request so let's go ahead and
create a pull request so now my
teammates can review my code changes to
make sure everything that I'm doing
looks good now let's jump back into
Azure boards again because if we look at
the development details check this out
here is where we initiate the pull
requests so everything that we do inside
of github is now tracked inside of Azure
boards pretty cool huh the only thing
left that we need to do is go ahead and
finish this particular poll request so
we'll come in here let's merge the poll
requests in the master so now we've
finished up that particular pull request
and bam did you see that just happen
automatically the bug because we
resolved it inside of github it
automatically resolved on our work item
board as well this right here is so
incredibly cool github issues they work
great but if your project gets a little
bit more complex having the power and
the flexibility of Azure boards it's
awesome and now with the github repo and
Azure board's linkage you can use both
so great tracking all this work is
awesome
but we still need the ability to add si
ICD for our repos even for our git repos
and how we can do that super easily and
let me show you what I mean let's jump
back into our github repo and what we're
going to do is create a CI CD pipeline
into Azure pipelines directly from
github so what we need to do is we need
to go to the marketplace and from here
we need to search for the Azure
pipeline's marketplace extension so both
go ahead and jump in here we'll do a
search so this is currently already
installed so I won't go through the
whole install process but I will show
you how easy it is to configure it we'll
go ahead and say let's go ahead and
configure a short pipe lines and it's
gonna ask for my password let me go
ahead and enter that in and now it's
gonna come in here and we're gonna say
you know what let's go ahead and add a
CI CD pipeline for my specific
repository we'll go ahead and save that
and now it's gonna route me back into
Azure DevOps and it's gonna ask me to
log in so let me log in with my
credentials and now it's going to ask me
which organization do you want to use
now I have a million organizations and
I'm in hopefully you guys don't have
nearly as many as I do so it'll be
easier to find but let me find my demo
account so it's going to be called as
your DevOps demo a and the project is
going to be my connect 2018 project and
we'll go ahead and continue and now it's
gonna walk me through a wizard to create
for me my build pipeline so we'll go
ahead and choose my github repo and
notice it analyzed my repo and it
figured out what technologies is being
used inside of that repo this repo is
holding a node.js app so it's going to
provide for me a no J's template that I
can just start using and immediately it
creates me a build pipeline written in
Yammer this is pipeline as code so as a
DevOps person this makes me super
excited because I can check this file in
and now any changes I make to it to the
build pipeline it will be version right
alongside
my code if you need more information
about it we have a handy link that will
take you directly to the docs pages as
well so here you can find everything
that you need all right so let's go
ahead and jump back into our build
pipeline we'll go ahead and save and
we'll run this so we'll save it and
we'll run it and so what is it doing
right now it's taking this yamo file and
it's taking this particular yamo file
and saving it in my github repo now
after it saved it to my github repo it's
gonna kick off the build and the very
first thing that's gonna do is it's
gonna go to github and download all of
my source code including this camel file
it will then load this build up and
start executing all the build steps
described in the yamo file this right
here like I said before as a dev ops
person this makes me ridiculously happy
pipeline as code so this build system
right here this is no different than the
visual editor that we used to use before
and in fact it's still around and you
can still use it it's the exact same
build engine underneath doing the exact
same thing it's just a task runner doing
one task after another but with the Gamo
build it describes it using a yamo file
instead of using the visual editor let
me show you what that visual editor
actually looks like so here's my build
and I created a build a custom build
that uses this particular editor the
visual editor and you'll notice it does
one task after another after another
after another
so customizing a build is super simple
with Visual Studio with Azure DevOps
because this right here is a task runner
just does one task after another so if
you want to customize this all you would
need to do is add or remove tasks now
out of the box there are hundreds of
tasks that you can just download and
start using but if you want to do
something that doesn't exist
out-of-the-box go to the marketplace in
the marketplace our partners have
created over 500 build and release tasks
that you can just download and start
using pretty cool and if what you want
to do doesn't exist out-of-the-box and
doesn't exist in the marketplace you can
write your own custom tasks as well
custom tasks nothing more than
PowerShell or no js' so what that means
is anything that you can do from the
command line you can easily get this
build and release system to do as well
all right so now if we go ahead and look
at our build it should be finished and
that's great right it's a pretty
rudimentary build it doesn't do a whole
lot it just kind of packages everything
up but what I really want to do is I
want to customize that build Yambol file
right I want to make it do exactly what
this visual build is doing I want it to
install NPM I need to set up my eat my
database connections I then want to
build my app this is a no js' app that
we compile into static web pages and
then I want to take all this up bundle
it up as a zip file so that's ready to
be deployed and check this out if you
have a visual editor you can just save
you as yamo and it'll take this visual
build and create all the gamal steps for
you where you can copy and just make
those changes so let's jump into the
build Yama file to make those changes so
let me jump in here let's pull our
changes down from our repo and now check
this out here's our ashore pipelines
demo file and here's what's in the repo
right now if we want to make changes
guess what we can just go ahead and
start making changes all right so let's
customize this and let's add a new task
and notice we're getting autocomplete
and we're getting syntax highlighting
and if we do a control space we'll
actually even get intellisense so this
right here makes editing the gamma file
so much easier we have in Azure
pipelines vs Cote extension that gives
us intellisense syntax highlighting and
autocomplete so we're going to add a new
task let's do something like I don't
know maybe we'll add a new get task and
we can do the inputs and we can see what
the input can be right and notice it
even gives us red highlights or red
squiggles so this is fantastic
intellisense syntax highlighting and
autocomplete makes
editing these yamo files so much easier
alright so what I wanted to do is I
really wanted to customize this with all
of my steps above so here is all we need
to do let me paste that in here and
we'll go ahead and save this and we'll
upload that code and we'll commit it and
what did we do we customized or build
and let's push those changes back in to
get help now as soon as my code hits
github it should kick off my build so
let's go ahead and jump back in to Azure
pipelines to see if the build has been
kicked off and there we go we customized
the build and it's kicking off the build
so what is this doing right now this
build its gonna go ahead and download
the latest source code from github
including the build ml file now it's
going to load that Gama follow-up and
it's going to execute the build steps
described in that build a mo file oh
this is awesome
so there's going to go ahead it's gonna
get my sources it's going to install NPM
it's going to setup my database
connections it's gonna go ahead and
build my app turn my node.js app into a
static set of files and it's going to
archive all of that so now it'll be
ready to be deployed all the way out
into production
all right looks like the build is
finished if we jump into a summary we
get a nice summary page that shows
everything that's happened during the
build but notice we haven't created a
release pipeline yet all right so let's
go ahead and create our release I'll
click on the release button and what
this will do is it will take us to our
visual editor now the very first thing
it's going to ask us is do we want to
apply a template which makes our job so
much easier now for this demo I'm gonna
go ahead and deploy my code into Azure
app service so I'll just use the app
service template now the way you set up
these releases is first you describe
what your stage is going to be so my
first stage is going to be for my
staging environment so we'll name it
staging and after we define what the
environment is going to be we can go
ahead and go into that particular
staging environment and now we'll
describe all the steps that we need to
take to deploy our application into this
particular stage now since I'm just
deploying an azure app service it
becomes super simple it's one task so
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna pick my subscription here's my
Azure subscription and after I pick my
subscription let's go ahead and deploy
this into the correct app service so let
me bring up the list of app services and
from here we'll go ahead and deploy this
into my staging environment which is
right here and that's literally all we
need to do we can jump back into our
pipeline because we've just described
one environment you describe your
environment you want to deploy to you
describe what tasks that you want to use
to deploy your application and now you
get to define who are the approvers so
before and after each environment you
can add a set of manual approvers so
I'll go ahead and add myself as an
approver and you can add a list of
people where every single person in the
list has to approve before it can flow
through the gate or you can add a group
of people where if one person approves
then it will flow through the gate or
you can use a combination of lists and
groups as well so I have a staging
environment I do need to have my
production environment so let me just go
ahead and clone that and let's describe
this correctly
so we'll call this my
environment and we have to go in and
update the tasks that we're going to use
to deploy my application into my
environment so instead of deploying this
into staging let's deploy this into my
production environment so of course some
of you are probably asking what do I
need to do if I need to customize my
deployment and do special tasks well
guess what this right here is just a
task runner exactly like the build so
what that means is to customize it you
would just add or remove tasks that you
need and just like the build out of the
box you get hundreds of tasks if what
you want to do doesn't exist
out-of-the-box jump into the marketplace
and if what you want to do doesn't exist
in the marketplace write your own tasks
tasks nothing more than nodejs
or PowerShell so anything you can do
from the command line you can easily get
this build and release system to do as
well so we've just completed this let's
go ahead and save this and let's go
ahead and kick off our release to see
what that will look like so we'll come
into our pipeline let's go ahead and
create a release and so now what is it
gonna do it's gonna grab the latest
build that we have and take those bits
and start releasing it through our dev
environment and it will go ahead and
execute the steps that we pimped
so here it is queued everything up and
now it's going to go ahead and deploy my
application into my staging environment
and grave that looks like we just
deployed into our staging environment
let's jump into our staging environment
we fresh that to make sure we deployed
and voila here's our code deployed into
staging fantastic so we can go ahead and
approve this looks good and staging and
after approving it now it's going to go
ahead and flow into our production
environment
and there you go there's our app
deployed all the way into the production
environment so as you can see creating a
full CI CD pipeline that will take your
code from github and deploy it all the
way out into production super simple to
do so there you go
as your DevOps we are the only cloud
vendor that makes it so simple to go
from nothing to a full CI CD pipeline
for any language targeting any platform
and yes this is for your code sitting in
your repository of choice deploying to
wherever you need it to be deployed of
course it can be a sure and man we've
made it so simple to deploy to Azure but
it can also just it easily be behind
your firewall in front of your firewall
remember any language targeting any
platform and not only that if you have
an open source project guess what you
get all of this for free you get 10
parallel pipelines out-of-the-box and if
you need more just ping us and we'll
give you more so what's that Donavan
Allah says go rub some DevOps on it no
man all you devs out there go to dev
Asher comm and let's drop a bucket load
of dev ops over all of this using at
your dev ops thank you

YouTube channel today's session will be
a guide to automate Excel using Python
and with the help of chat jpt
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel
like the tutorial and hit the Bell icon
to never miss an up and before starting
let's have a simple quiz question to
brush upon our knowledge and your
question is what does GPT stand for in
chat GPD
and your options are generative
pre-training Transformer and your second
option is generative pre-training
transmission and the third option is
generative pre-training turbine and your
fourth option is none of these please
answer in the comment section below and
we will update the correct answer in the
pin command you can pause the video give
it a thought and answer in the comment
section
and moreover I have an insightful for
you guys if you are focused on building
strong foundational skills for career
growth in that case you can check out a
free course to Learn Python Basics with
a completion certification from scale up
by simply loan you can check this course
with the link in the description box
below
and moving on
now we'll start with that chat jbt to
automate our Excel and we have some
Excel files I will upload them
in the link
with the GitHub so you can freely
download them and you can also try this
project with those files and here we are
with the chat jpt so now we are on the
chatgpt website and here you can see
option and when you click it we will be
redacting to the chat jpt the chat box
and before that I will show you the home
page
it's showing us the samples what we can
do with the jet GPT
the methods
and there's the collect demonstration
data and train a supervised policy like
how it's trained how open AI has trained
the child GPT and its limitations
they have mentioned all the things here
iterative deployment
and moving on now we will login
to our chat repeating
foreign
with my Google account
tell us about you and this is my name
and he is asking
my phone number
so I will get this blood so you guys
won't be seeing my phone number okay
he's asking for the code
I am waiting for the code after entering
the OTP you would be directed to this
page that is chatgpt and this is the
feed box where you can write any query
in the simple natural language that
would be English and the chat gbt would
answer your questions
and if we talk about chat jpt a little
bit information about chargeability that
it's an AI powered chatbot that has been
developed by open Ai and the chatbot
understands natural language and
response in a human-like manner it is
based on GPT 3.5 which is a language
model
and the chatbot was unveiled as a
prototype on November 30 2022 while
announcing the chatbot open AI wrote on
its announcement page that we have
trained a model called chat jpt which
interacts in a conversational way the
dialog format makes it possible for chat
GPD to answer follow questions admit its
mistake challenge incorrect premises and
reject inappropriate requests so now we
will talk about the chat gbt so chat jbt
is an AI powered chat board that has
been developed by the artificial
intelligence and it's been researched by
the company open Ai and the chatbot
understands natural language and
responds in a human-like manner it is
based on GPT 3.5 which is a language
model the chatbot was unveiled as a
prototype on November 30 2022 while
announcing the chatbot open AI wrote on
its announcement page that we have
trained a model called chat jpd which
interacts in a conversational way the
dialog format makes it possible for
chatgpt to answer follow-up questions
admit its mistake challenge incorrect
premises and reject inappropriate
requests
so this is jtpd and it's been going all
the developers around the globe
so now we will start with automating
Excel with the help of child deputy and
with the help of Python language
so first
we will create a folder and see the
Excel files with which
we will use Python and with the help of
chat jpt
we will automate them
so first we'll create a folder for our
project and we'll create in Python
projects and name it as
automate Excel using
chair jpt
and inside this
we will open the command prompt
and now we'll open any idea link so that
we will write a request to chat GPT and
he'll answer us with the suitable code
and that code will copy paste into our
ideally and run it if it gives any error
we will copy paste the error same to the
chat jpt and as I know he answers them
so here
we will open our ideally and for that we
are writing a command that is code space
period and that will open our ideally
that is Visual Studio mode
now
we have open our ideally and first we'll
create a file here
or first we will see our Excel files on
which we will
do the automation
and for that
we'll get back to our folder
and here we have the number folder in
which we have two files that is CSV
files
phone number and phone number two
and other we have the sales folder and
in that we have the date of the sales of
the Year 2022
so we will use these files
sales and the number so we'll cut them
and
get to a folder
and inside the number file no we'll
start with sales
first we'll do the automation
with the sales files
so we'll open the sales folder
and inside that we will create a file
that would be the py file
and the first automation we would be
doing is concatenating all the files in
a single Excel file we have the files
from January to December that is the
sales files so we will concatenate them
and ask the chat GPT to write the code
sorry to concatenate all these
so for that
we'll name the file as concatenate only
need
underscore data Dot py
so now
we will give the command to the chat GPT
so here is our child GPD and here
we will write a command for it
that would be I have 12 Excel files
and I want to concatenate them
and we'll also mention the name named
January
spelling of January is this only
but we'll check with the file January
and then we have February
and moving on
soon we have till December
so we have all these 12 files and now we
will command him
to use python
to concatenate the data inside the 12
axis files into one file
so this is our Command and it's in the
simplest natural language that is the
English language so we'll just press
enter
okay it shows us that an error occurred
if the issue is
so for this thing we will just copy the
open a link and paste it here and open
it
as the chat jpd is seeing a huge traffic
sometimes it shows
these errors
so he's very famous but we are a robot
or not
so
we will agree with the charge ability
and answer its questions here
it's asking again okay now we are clear
with the charge ability and we'll paste
our Command here and press enter
and here you can see that it has started
answering our question that you can use
the pandas library in Python to read in
the data from each of the Excel files
and use the concat function to combine
the data for more levels into one data
frame here's an example of how you want
to use okay
he's going you know very right menu
and he has imported pandas and then
create a data name and using the for
Loop
is going through all the months reading
the Excel file
and appending okay done
and result he is concatenated but he has
not created the
Excel file where we can see all the data
and he has also not printed it
so what we want
so first we'll see
what does this code do as I have seen so
it will concatenate but it has not
created the Excel file in which we can
see all the data
so we have copied the code
we'll paste it here
save it and run it
and most important thing you have to
import the pandas Library
and if you have not installed it please
install it in the command prompt with
the command pip install pandas or you
can use it in the terminal
okay
it has not found
the january.xls
okay so J and u a r y
okay we will see
what error it expects
we'll save this and run once again
so we'll just copy the error and write
it back to chat GPT and see
how does it respond
okay is seeing is indicating that the
panel server is unable to find the Excel
file you are trying to read in based on
the error message look like the files
are not located in the same directory as
the python script
okay we'll see that but we have
the python script and the library
in the same
folder
yeah
and we'll check once again here
let's go data.py yeah
they are in the same folder and why we
have this error
okay into
soon there it is we have opened our
ideally
in
the automated Excel using chat GPD
folder and currently we are in sales
folder
so it is not recognizing
the directory
so what we'll do
we'll copy all these files
copy the sales files
and paste it here
now
we'll run the port that
chat CPT provided us
okay uh yeah it has done successfully
is good successfully okay we'll try once
again we'll kill the terminal
save it and run it again
now we'll see yeah it has executed
successfully uh but the thing is it has
note
converted it into
a single Excel file for that we will
write
you forgot
to
create
the concatenated
file
as we also haven't mentioned in our
Command
specifically
so we have to be specific with our
commands also
let's see
yeah after concreting the data frame
to export to a Excel file and we can
just write this command
and index equal to false here okay and
he's giving all the explanations so you
can just read them correct I apologize
for the oversight to create a new Excel
file that contains a container data you
can use the to underscore Excel method
of the data frame here is an example of
how you could do this okay you create a
new Excel file name underscore data.xl
SX the same directory as your python
script and it will contain the
concatenated data form
from all of the original Excel files you
could also use a to underscore CSM
method to save the data frame in CSV
format yeah
we can do that also
okay well
make the xlsx file
and just beneath it
okay uh
yeah
see part two uh
okay
we don't need any path we'll just do it
here only
here result.2 Excel
and then let's put data dot SLS
so we'll save this and run it
is showing that it has executed
successfully
area outside the seeds folder we'll
close it you can see that it has created
the concatenated underscore data.xlsx
so for that we move area it has created
it here
we'll open it
and first I will show you
what these files contain
so every file have the entry of around
thousand
every file has 1000
entries
so the account created file should have
around 12000.
so this is the concentrated underscore
data
and if we go beneath
yeah we can see
2000
and it's 12 guy it says it has
concatenated all the data
responded and we have to precise with
the commands what we are writing in
English
as it has not mentioned to convert it
into Excel file now when we have written
it again it has done that
now moving on we will do the second
automation
and for that we'll move back to our
ideally and the next automation we would
be doing would be
that we will be using the sum and the
average function
to all the files that is from January to
December files and will
use sum and average function I will show
you we will use
so it's concatenated data
so we'll open the August file
and here
you can see the
quantity in the H column
so we'll average down the quantity so
what is the average per customer
and
in the J column we have the total cost
so we'll add all the cost in all the
files
this is the August file from January to
December we will do in column match
the average for the quantities and
column J will do the sum of the total
amount per customer
and we'll get it printed at the last
column
that would be we have the Thousand
entries
it's going till
h1001 so we would get it printed on
h1002 and the sum we would get it
printed on j1002
okay so moving on we'll close these
files
we will get back to our charge repeating
and give him a command that
I have 12 Excel files
and will tell him that we have named
them
January
then we have
February
then
we have till December
and now
we want you to use python
to
apply
the sum formula
the sum formula and the average formula
so the sum formula would be applied from
J2 to j1001
let's see okay we have closed file you
have already remember
some formula
from
J2 to J one double zero one
okay and
the average function
and now we want him to use the average
formula
from H2 to h1001
okay and that would be in all the Excel
files
and we want him to write the results
in the cells and that would be J one
double zero two
and
h1002 is respectively
so we have to be precise with the
commands and we have
an error here and that is done and yeah
it's all done
now just
give this command to charge jpt and see
how it answers use dependence library in
Python to renew okay
and perform the sum and average
calculations good and then write the
results back to the same file here is an
example of how you could do this
now we are writing in the same file
okay very important is PD and running a
loop for all the months
we have red
all the Excel files one by one and
we are taking the cell movement
and
doing the sum
and doing the mean
of the H column yeah it's good
Excel
yeah
I think it would
do a job
so we'll copy this and create a new file
and name it as
sum Dot py
and inside this we will paste the code
that our GPT has provided us
and we'll run this
and it has executed successfully okay no
uh we got an error that is
it has made the mistake
and got it
okay let me just see what query
Spherion I have 12xl files named January
2 the summer and use Python to apply the
sum formula from J2 to
j1001 and the average formula from H2 to
h1001 in all the files and write the
results
a
done
uh we would be a little specific
and the cells j102
and okay
okay okay yeah
then once again submit it if we didn't
get
okay yeah now he has used open
Excel Library that's good
yeah
that would be working for us
let's see
what he will provide to us
okay
oh she active and
okay
okay
yeah
I think
oh you can solve the purpose but first
we'll run it
so he is
giving us the explanation for what he
has written this code that is this code
will apply the sum formula to the range
j22 j1001 and the average formula to the
range H2 to h1001 in all the Excel files
the results will be written in j1002 and
h1002 respectively it is important to
note that this code will overwrite the
original file so that it's recommended
to make a backup okay we don't need that
and we have backup in the sales folder
also so you can also the read underscore
excellent to underscore Excel function
from Panama
okay
so we'll try this code
uh it is
import OS and guys uh you have to
install all these libraries open p by
Excel I have already installed them you
can search on the browser that open py
Excel installation Python and it would
be directed to pypi.com that's the
official website for the particular
libraries and there you can see the
command that will be the PIP install and
the particular command for the module
name
uh it is showing that it has run
successfully so we'll just see
if it has done its job or not
and in the April file we have in the H
column that is the average of the edge
column that puts items and in the J
column we have the total sum of the
amount of the customers yeah
the query has run successfully chat GPT
has provided us with the perfect code
hats off to the jet GPT and moving on
now we'll do some other automations
and now
what we can do
uh
we have other files that is phone number
and phone number two
and what it contains
it contains the phone numbers
so what we could do is
we could add the plus 91 extension that
is the country code for India we will
ask chargpt to add the country code plus
91 to both the files
so I'll close these files
and first
we'll copy them and paste in a
root directory so we don't get any error
and we'll
change the Slate
name
instead of hyphen
we will add the underscore
okay
now
we'll move back to charge upd and write
a command
and these files are CSV files node xlsx
file
yeah these are CSV files both the files
are cable files other files are xlsx
files
okay so for that we will write the
command to charge everything that
I have two files
uh
with DOT CSV extension
and they are named
phone underscore
number and the second was named
phone underscore number underscore 2.
okay so we have told the jet GPT that we
have two files and now we will tell him
to use python
to add the country code
and the
country
code
plus 9 1
as
string prefix
and that would be adding as a string
prefix else it would only show nine when
it won't show plus so we'll see if chat
jpd understand that or not
as string prefix in both the CSV files
with
column name that was phone
okay now we'll just press enter
and wait for a charge update to answer
this query
and we'll see
how it responds
you can use the printers as well okay
and the prefix to the phone numbers and
and the modified data packages are okay
here you know
I wouldn't do this okay
[Music]
um
[Music]
it's heading as step string okay it has
an estimate that
and to CSV
then this code will get in both of us
here I think this will work
we have copied the code it's controlled
in both CSV files and the plus timeline
string to the phone numbers and
write the modify data back to the sales
files it's modern to know that this will
overwrite the original file so it's
required to make a backup of The
Originals okay
uh you could also use the apply function
to add the prefix to the phone number in
the column okay
so okay yeah we can do this also
with the Lambda function
and that's all
this will also do a job
first we'll see this
and we will
create a file
for this Automation and name it as
country code dot py okay
and we'll
paste the code here
and run it for you guys
it's showing that it has executed
successfully
uh yeah it has executed successfully
so we'll just
go back to our files
and see
whether the code plus 91 as in prefix or
not okay the numbers
okay the files code only nine one as
the column it's still in the number
format
it hasn't
converted into string format
uh we'll see the second chord also
like
yeah it has converted xender string
okay Lambda X we'll see
whether it's working or not
it has worked uh and the issue is we
have
change the files permission denied okay
we have opened a file we'll close it
on Save
tillness and run it again
now it shows it has
executed successfully
we'll open the files
and now if we see
it is showing here now it has added two
nine months
you know
uh so now issues uh the thing is first
we have to
transform it into the string format and
then we can add plus 9 1 as a string to
that string
so chat Jeopardy misses with the
slightest
implementation the code
now moving on uh we'll see this command
later
if you want to see how we can add Plus
90 I will tell you how to write that
code
okay
so now moving on we will do another
Automation and we would be glad to know
that chat GPT
improves the existing code
like uh in the first automation it has
concatenated but it hasn't converted the
concatenated file like it hasn't created
that file it had created the file when
we have returned to it that you forgot
to create that file so chat jpd it
modulates the existing code also
and moving on
now
uh in any
okay we'll open the concatenated
underscore data Dot xlsx
and inside this
okay we have the product line
so what we'll do is
we will change the
name of the electronic assessors to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to Lifestyle
now we'll automate this process
and we can do this automation all the
files also from January to December
so we'll do that only okay
now here
we will command is
okay now we'll command the charge APD
that using python
I trade
through
all the Excel files
in the
directory so we are asking him to
iterate to all the Excel files in the
directory and we will ask him to replace
electronic access
electronic accessories
see the spelling
accessories okay
yeah electronic access with electronic
equipments
and
also ask him
equipments
[Music]
okay I'll do equipment only
and
home and lifestyle we have chosen yeah
and
um and lifestyle
and
change it with only
live Style
okay so using python we are iterating
through all the Excel files and changing
these
uh that would be in each Excel file
so we have to be specific without
written language and now we'll save the
modified workbook in
will create another folder and in that
we'll save the files
okay
save the
modified
file
in the
out
put folder
and if the folder is not created
we'll ask him to create it
okay
then create one
hold on and
add it in
okay oh I don't know why I'm saving this
so I have written the command I will
press enter
so that charge upd can process it and
give us the code for that
so it's showing us
sweating and that was show what you're
showing us
uh you can use the voice Library tools
Excel files and inductory the panel's
library to read in the files and make
the changes and to save the modified
files okay here's an example of how you
could do this
now here
we imported OS and others PD
and it has written the code we'll copy
that this code will write to all the
Excel files in the current directory
replace electronic recesses with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle in the data
frame and then save the modified files
in the output folder if the
sorry if the output folder doesn't exist
the script will create it
you can also use replace function to
replace the values in the column okay
and they selected through all the cells
in each row of the Excel sheet and
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and human lifestyle
with lifestyle if the cell value is
equal to the respective string okay we
have copied a code
and now
we will create a file
and
name it as itrade.py
it paste the code here and run it for
you guys
the code has been executed successfully
now we'll see
open all the files not all but yeah let
me open some
that was the previous Electronics this
is
okay so it hasn't changed
in this
okay we will open another file
and see if we code the changes in that
or not
that also States the electronic
accessories so it hasn't
done its job
so we'll move back to GPT
and use this code if it functions else
we will write back to the chair GPD
okay
just a second and read the code okay we
are using the place
and find the next sentence
okay
so for there you have to import the OS
done
node underscore book
and for that
about this
and run it
include these files
okay
now we'll see
if we quote our solution or not
no it's showing electronic accessories
and home and lifestyle
so
chair GPT doesn't
go to the code to change them
so we'll ask him another time and with a
different language this time
so I don't think it has created the
output folder
it has oh sorry
I'm really sorry what I have done is my
mistake
those were the original files
and we have the product line here
and we have electronic accessories here
and that should be equipments
okay uh we have electronic accessories
and lifestyle
let me see my command
okay I have asked them to
change electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and
women lifestyle with lifestyle so let's
change only lifestyle
and see
okay
okay
uh the E here is small
we'll update that
in the code
you can write this back to chat jpd also
but yeah
first do this
showing
notice executed successfully
foreign
accessories
that's in the capital E okay okay
okay okay so this code is giving us
error
we'll see the last word and copy that
and
try to use this
and close the terminal and run it again
it has executed successfully now we will
see the file
whether it has changes or not it has not
ask the chat GPT
what have you done brother
using python Android through all the
Excel files in the duct and replace
electronic accessories with electronic
equipment and home and lifestyle with
lifestyle okay in each Excel file save
the modified
modifies
[Music]
okay
we will ask the same thing once again
to him
and with this electronic accessories oh
sorry
and save the modified file
the output folder and get a folder it
doesn't exist okay
okay
um
[Music]
you haven't seen once again
let's close these files
it's actually rooted successfully now
will open it
and now we can see that it has changed
to electronic equipment
electron equipment
yeah now it has executed successfully
maybe there would be an error
with this while copying it as we have
also created the output folder but we
forgot to see in that photo maybe that
could be the error from our site
now we are done with the
changing of the column names
uh it's the cell names that was
electronic accessories to electron
equipments and home and lifestyle to
Lifestyle
now we'll do the next automation
for that
first we'll open an Excel file
this was in the output folder
you get back to our main directory and
open the file July
inhale
here we will
filter the Excel file or gender
that is we'll select gender as female
and with the unique values in column
City
and we'll extract the data from
column A to q that would be the whole
data
and for each Unique city value we'll
create a new Excel file for each City
and that will contain data only for that
City and for females only
and after that we'll save this file in a
folder named City so we'll give this
command to chatgpt
and here you can also specify the module
you want chat jpd to use for the
particular command
here we will be commanding our chat GPT
to use the pandas module and for that
we'll write the command
command in the natural language I'll
give this command to the chat jbd
and for that we'll write using Python
and pandas
filter the
okay we will just pick a single Excel
file or we can
pick the concatenated file
that is concatenated underscore data
filter the
concatenated
underscore data
Dot
Excel SX
foreign
Excel file
and that would be for gender
female
and by the
unique values in column City
we first will give the command
by the
unique values
in the column
City
and after that we want to extract the
data from column A to q that is the
whole sheet
extract the data
from the column
A2
q and for each Unique city value
foreign
for each unique
City
value
now we will extract the data and now
we'll create a new Excel file so for
that also we'll give the command to chat
jpd and we'll write create a new Excel
file
and that would be for each City
okay
so we will write
create a new
Excel file
or each
City
containing
data
only for
that
City
and four females
okay
and save this file in the
City folder
and if it's
not being there
chargpt can create the folder for that
also
okay
City folder and
naming the
each file with the city name okay
naming each file
after the
course
bonding
City
okay
now
if the
CT folder that is we have written the
small City
ok
if the city folder doesn't exist
then create it
before saving the files
okay
now we have given this command to the
chat GPT and it has responded us with
you can use the pandas Library as we
already mentioned to use that to read in
the concatenated underscore data.xlsx
file and filter the data for gender
female group the data by the unique
values in the city column and extract
the data from the specified columns for
each group and here is an example
so we have Port the code
we'll wait till chat GPD continues
and we can see that the chat GPT has
completed
and
we will copy this code
settings
[Music]
for setting group in female data root
Group by okay City
and you could also use the SN method to
filter the data frame for female gender
okay first
we'll see this
and for
that we will create filter.py
and run the code
it has been executed successfully so now
you'll see that the city folder has been
created or not
I'm not able to see the city folder
okay it's been created
as you can see okay it's been created
man it's still empty
so we'll give time
okay and we quote an error take
everything
okay okay we will pass this error to
chat jpd first
and after that we'll see what's wrong
with this
on your so direct messenger scene isn't
getting that the column name specified
in the list
are not present in the data frame it's
likely that the actual column names in
the data frame are different than the
ones you specified in the list
okay you just see the list
that is concatenated data
and go back
and see that is A2
okay it's still r
okay we made a little mistake here
so we'll just
change our Command
yeah
this is it
and
instead of Q now we'll write r and save
and submit now we'll see what it would
generate for us
I'm going to close this
thank you
okay this one will end up on any friends
in Excel files we'll turn the data for a
few minutes and group the data by the
unique values in the city column great
and extract the data from the column
eight wire for each Unique city name and
then create a new Excel file for each
City containing data only for that City
and for females files will be saved in
the city folder naming each file after
the corresponding setting okay
it's done now we'll copy the score
and paste it here and see
whether this code works for us or not
so it's been executed successfully
now we have moved to the setting okay
it's executing so I will give time
to the code
and it do it so yeah it's been execute
successfully
okay so there were three cities that was
Mandalay
and Yangon
and if I show you the data
you could see
there's the three cities and it has
created the Excel files with the name of
the settings only the unique cities and
it has extracted the data for the gender
female
now we'll see those files
close this
and back
in the city folder
would see them and lay City
and the data is just for the females
so this automation works well with
chatgpt
now moving on we will do one more
automation
and that would be to use Python to
identify what is the count of each
payment mode
so for that
I will just
get you aware of the payment modes in
our sheet and we'll do this automation
on the concatenated data sheet only
so this is the payment column and you
can see the amount of payments that is
evolit cash credit card
and these are repeating so we'll use
Python to identify what is the count of
each payment mode from column m
column entry and that is from this sheet
only and then we'll create a new sheet
and name it as
count.xlsx and write the count against
each payment method
so we'll give this command to our
chatgpt
and ask him to write the code for our
automation
so we are writing use Python to identify
use Python to identify
what is the
count
of
each
payment method
from
column and the column was n from column
n and that was in
concatenated
underscore data dot xlsx sheet
and
create a new sheet
named
count Dot xlsx
and
write the count
against
each payment method
okay
now we have given this command to our
chat jpd and we'll see what it offers to
us you can use the panel library today
okay that's the same value counts
function to get the count of each main
method okay and you can use the 2XL
method to the data frame to write the
count to a new sheet okay that's good
and he has imported the pandas library
and create the DF variable in which he
has read the concatenated file and used
counts function with the payment method
and when we go look okay the column name
is payment
note payment method I think it would
generate
an error for us
so
it's python of each one method from
column
and
and we will specify
column M and that is named
payment
as it has used payment method here you
can see
that it has used the
column name as payment method
so we'll specify this
we have to be very specific with our
commands
for these automations for simple tasks
you can use
simple language
no complex sentences or you have to
mention every detail but for these
automations you have to use them
now our charge Deputy is working with
this and mostly he will deliver us with
the perfect code I hope so
okay uh
test right and the value count and it
has
exported
mode reset
you would also have function to group
the data by the payment method and use
the size version
method okay
okay we'll see this
oh
and here
we will
create a file
as count.py
and in this file we'll paste the code
delivered us by the chatgpt
we have
executed it
s being executed we'll wait for that
it's mean as you would successfully
so we have back to our folder
and we have to look for
well count file now yeah account file
yeah
it is
okay yeah
it's showing us the
mode of payment status ewallet cash
credit card and the number of
usage
you know four four eight thousand three
yeah it's twelve thousand that was the
whole entry of the account candidate
underscore data dot xlsx so we have done
with this Automation and now we'll do
one last automation
and first we'll
close all these files
okay
and moving back to our chat GPT and now
we will do
we will rename all the 12 Excel files
that was January February to December
and we'll add the word
or car sales
just before the month name that would we
will just add the prefix before the
month name
and for that
we will give the command to the chair
GPT in the natural language
and here only we'll change it in the mid
director only as we have the copy of all
these files
so for this we'll write the Quant use
python
rename
all the 12 Excel files
named
January
February
until December
okay
and that is present in my
directory
and what we have to do is we have to
add
the word
will add Car Sales okay
car sales
and
front of
each
in front of
each file name
okay
so what it will do is Car Sales
underscore January Car Sales underscore
February and so on
so we'll wait for the chat GPD you can
use the OS library to iterate through
all the Excel files and indictment then
use the restore training function okay
to rename the files here's an example of
how you could do this
photo s and we have the months
okay
this code will iterate through all the
Excel files in the current directory and
add car sales in front of each file name
and those files would be those only the
months
and good it's using the glow module
and you could also use the global model
okay that's the second chord
it's the easy one okay
but we'll go with OS first
and get back to R
Aid ideally and name the file as rename
Dot py
and here we'll paste the code
and run it
it's been executed will move back yeah
you could see that car sales have been
added to all the files
and with that we have done with our
automations
and if you want you can also submit your
code to chatgpt and ask it to add
commands to your code so that it could
explain you what that line does or what
that function is it would explain very
tediously and
if you want you can also try chat jbd to
automate many office tasks
you can automate PowerPoint for that and
do many more tasks with chat jpd and
with that
we have come to the end of this session

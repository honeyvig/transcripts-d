This is the greatest time in
human history to be blind.
The capacity to access
technology opens up
incredible doors.
I'm one of triplets and
we're all born
three months early,
and the oxygen that was used
to keep us alive
caused our blindness.
It's never been a barrier for
me achieving what I
want to achieve in life.
I work as a law lecturer and
I'm currently undertaking my
Ph.D. And I'm also a Director
with Vision Australia.
>> Remedies of law.
>> When I'm at work,
I spend my life in Office 365,
and I love its
accessibility features.
In Word, I'm constantly
editing documents.
I'm able to use comments to
provide feedback on
student assignments.
In Outlook, I'm always
in the calendar.
The calendar controls my life.
The nature of my job
means I'm often either at
conferences or doing
work on the go.
Surface gives me the flexibility
to do all of those things,
as does Office 365,
because all my files
are stored in the Cloud,
and I can access
them from anywhere.
I absolutely love Seeing AI.
To me, it's an example
of Microsoft taking
a leap forward using some of
their research and
their ability to innovate.
>> Sanitarium peanut butter.
>> If my children hand
me a note from school,
I can use Seeing AI to give me
a very brief instant overview
of what's on the document.
>> Science credit. Jasper roles.
>> The value for me with
accessible technology is it
actually allows me to reach
my full potential
rather than worrying
about whether something's
accessible or not.

hey everyone i'm shambly and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on azure active directory
in this video i will take you through
what is azure active directory
followed by what is the difference
between windows 80 and azure 80
then we will look into the services
audience i.e who uses these services
and at last we will have a quick demo of
azure active directory
so let's get started with the video
first
what is azure active directory
but before getting into the definition
of azure ad let's have a real-life
example of azure ad to understand it in
a better way
there are a lot of pre-created
applications that you can offer
user access to using azure ad
so netflix is one of them
so here's the scenario
you want to share a netflix account with
a dozen people from your organization
giving your netflix username and
password to everyone isn't safe
so how do you give them access
your enters azure ad
the netflix application is available in
the azure ad gallery and can be added to
your azure edit tenant
this adds the application to your
tenancy and allows you to save your
netflix credentials in the secured
credential store
so that users can be assigned to it
the only people who have access are the
ones you give it to unless they have
their own account you're essentially
building a company
wide password vault then assigning
people to the systems
they require access to so they can log
in without
knowing the username and password for
those systems all they need is the azure
ad account or password and azure ad will
handle the rest
so saying in technical terms azure
active directory is a cloud-based
identity and access management
service from microsoft that allows your
employees to sign in and access
resources such as microsoft 365 the
azure portal and thousands of other sas
apps
and internal resources such as apps on
your company's intranet and network as
well as any cloud apps built by a
company
azure ad is required for sign-in and
identity protection in microsoft online
business services such as microsoft 365
and azure
if you sign up for any microsoft online
business
you will be given access to azure ad
which includes all of the free services
but what makes azure 80 so different
from windows 80 that it has become more
popular among people from technical
firm what is windows 80
active directory saves information about
network objects and make it easier for
administrator and users to find and use
their information
it organizes directory information
logically
and hierarchically using a structured
data store
but its supreme drawback is its layers
so let's have a look at its layers and
its functioning
first is adds
windows active directory domain services
active directory domain services is an
example of a directory service that
provides mechanisms for storing
directory data and making it available
to network users and administrators
second is adfs actor directory
federation services
federated identity and access management
is made possible by active directory
federation service
which securely shares digital identity
and entitlements right across security
and corporate boundaries to provide
customers partners and suppliers with a
streamlined user experience while
accessing an organization's web-based
applications
adfs extends the ability to employ
single sign-on capability accessible
within a single security or enterprise
boundary to internet pacing apps
third is
adrms active directory right management
services microsoft's active directory
rights management services safeguard
sensitive documents and emails unlike
traditional security methods like
firewalls and acls a the rms encryption
and protection remain constant
regardless of where file goes or how it
is transferred
but
azure active directory actually combine
these layers and make the whole process
more easier and hassle free
azure ad combines these layers into two
layers waad windows active azure
directory and windows azure access
control service
windows active azure directory combines
all the problems revolving around
identification management
and windows azure access control service
takes care of federating all the
services of an organization
so let's have an example when an
employee joined the premises of an
organization the administrator guides
them towards signing to particular
services they use
and then give access to it and the
employees can access these services
through the credentials like username
and password
now that we know what is azure active
directory and how it functions different
from adds let's have a look at the
service audience of azure active
directory
azure ad is majorly intended to rit
admins app developers and online
subscribers
for it admins you can use azure ad as an
it administrator to limit access to your
apps and app resources based on your
business needs
when accessing critical organizational
resources for example you can utilize
azure ad to enforce multi-factor
authentication
finally azure active directory provides
you with strong features to help you
protect users identities and credentials
while also meeting your access
governance requirements as an app
developer you may utilize azure ad to
add single sign-on to your app using a
standard based method
allowing it to function with the user's
existing credentials
also azure ad
has apis that may be used to create
customized app experiences based on
existing organizational data
for online subscribers
you're already using
azure area as a subscriber
each tenant of microsoft 365 office 365
azure and dynamic crm online is an azure
ad 10 by default
you may begin managing access to your
connected cloud apps right away
so now that we know the basic concept of
azure ada let's have a quick demo of it
so the first thing we need to do is log
in in our azure id account
and then go to azure active directory
sector here you will see add option
where you can
add a user group enterprise application
app registration according to your
choice
and below that
you can search for any intent like for
user
or for any group
so right now it doesn't belongs to any
group
or there is no user
with this name
here you will get basic information
like their name what is their id
what is the license
which groups they belong
and what are devices they use you can
also have an access to
their password as well

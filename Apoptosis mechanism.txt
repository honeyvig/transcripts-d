hi Venus and back here to explain the
detail details of happiness I'm back
here to explain the concept of this epic
process completely in examination point
of view how to handle the questions how
to go the right answer with most of the
questions and everything okay so coming
to this process okay we have already
learned the basics and everything
related to this I'll be focusing more on
the flow chart so it occurs by two ways
one is one is the intrinsic pathway and
the second one is the extrinsic path so
intrinsic pathway means simply it should
be inside the cell okay so intrinsic
pathway is basically in your
mitochondria intrinsic pathway starts
inside the mitochondria because it is
inside the cell whereas your extrinsic
pathway is going to start this is a
normal cell in the cell receptors cell
membrane receptors you can call it as
death receptor sometimes it's called as
death receptor pathway that is outside
the cell inside the cell mitochondria
intrinsic pathway outside the cell that
is death receptor pathway extrinsic okay
so what happens inside the cell okay
inside the cell like during the process
of this
type of ptosis inside the cell there
will be lysis of mitochondria or you can
simply call it as increasing in the
permeability rather than lysis word it
is better to add increasing in the
permeability of mitochondria so whenever
there is increasing in the probability
of mitochondria as we know that there is
something called as cytochrome C which
is present in the mitochondria is now
released into the cytoplasm so
cytochrome C which is present in the
mitochondria is now released in the
cytoplasm
so this cytochrome C which is present in
the mitochondria releasing into the
cytoplasm is going to react with few
genes that is a PF one okay
so this is going to react with the
cytochrome C that is now the cytochrome
C is called as cytoplasmic cytochrome C
okay is going to react with this and
it's going to activate it's going to
activate cap says nine it's going to
activate the cap says so and this nine
is the one which is going to take the
restore process but it's going to
activate the C okay so
or the protein that is the protein that
is present in mitochondria which is
cytochrome C is now going to leak out
and it is going to come into the
cytoplasm this released protein
cytoplasm see now is going to bind with
ap a F a PA a factor that is nothing but
apoptosis activating factor okay so
total me this combination is called as a
pop the pasta so okay this combination
is called as a pop Toso which is going
to activate this caps s name so I from
this this is one mode of activating
capsules
by cytochrome Sims apart from this there
is other mode of occurrence of the
activation of caps a snipe that is there
is something called as because I have
seen questions on this area so that
there's a reason why I'm stressing a lot
so there is something called as SMAC
which is also called as d I a BL want to
blow okay so this is other other protein
okay other mitochondrial protein that is
going to leach out
so apart from cytochrome C the second
modality is even this protein will leech
out and it leach out and it inhibits
anti-apoptotic IPS okay this factor
which is going to come into the
cytoplasm and it's going to stop or it's
going to inhibit IEP this IEP is nothing
but this is nothing but physiological
inhibitor of apoptosis so it's going to
stop it's going to stop the inhibitor of
apoptosis by which it's going to
activate the capsid s9 okay so this is
what the intrinsic pathway is okay this
is what the intrinsic pathway okay i'm
repeating you again so intrinsic means
inside the mitochondria so during this
process mitochondria permeability
increases one factor which is going to
come out from mitochondrial cytochrome C
cytochrome C is going to bond with APA
f1 that is apoptosis activating factor
fun to form a popular song this
apoptosome is going to initiate caps s9
so the second modality is there is other
protein called as SMAC or Taplow which
is going to leak out from mitochondria
and this leak out is going to activate
or inhibit the inhibiting factors by
which activating the caps s9 so cap says
nine is the end product of extrinsic
pathway of apoptosis the next comes is
the sorry we are talking about the
interns
a pathway that is inside the mind inside
the cell that is mitochondria so next
one is the extrinsic pathway extrinsic
pathway as already said it is outside
and it is basically associated with a
dead receptor which is present on the
cell membrane that is death receptor
pathway okay so death receptor pathway
so what what happens with the death
receptor pathway so death receptor
pathway is basically is mainly concerned
with transmembrane protein okay it is
mainly concerned with the transmembrane
protein which is called as F a s okay
this transmembrane protein is coded on
CD 95 receptor a fierce is a
transmembrane protein is basically so to
ligate this to ligate this there is
something called as f SL alpha like it
or you can simply remember it as L for
love means to create a bond okay alpha
like it right
so both these both this FAS and F ASL
they combined together okay they combine
together to activate the capsizes okay
to activate the the capsizes so what
capsules are regularly activated by
extrinsic pathway are capsules eight and
particularly in humans it's going to be
okay eight and ten are mainly concerned
with extrinsic pathway whereas nine is
mainly concerned with the intrinsic
pathway the clear intrinsic is nine
extrinsic is eight and so so end product
is activation of nine here activation of
eight and ten here so both these okay
factors which are going to further
further activate further activate three
and six until now okay factor nine is
from mitochondria sorry capsules nine is
from mitochondria and capsules
eight and ten
the cell that is extrinsic pathway so
both are they're going to activate three
and six so this three and six is going
to activate the endonucleases and
endonucleases causes the damage so this
is a rough flowchart so apart from this
particular flow chart they are other few
things that you have to make a note okay
always there there there will be some
people who will be supporting you if
you're doing if you're doing something
like if you're doing preparation few
people will support you and few people
will oppose you further cell to go with
this process of apoptosis you have
something called as a pop-top genes
another one are active for this and
genes so they will ask your question
which of the following is an tape
approach in which of the following you
have to remember particularly auntie are
more important that is bcl-2 okay most
of your questions will move around PCL
group of our cousins basically what what
is this bcl called as BC BC L is nothing
but it is first detected on the B
lymphocyte it is detected on the b
tselem for send
okay that is b-cell lymphomas it is
called as bcl-2 or bcl-2 family group
okay so apart from the bcl-2 there is
something called as MCL what few people
call it as MC and one it is also the
most common gene that is associated with
the drug resistance to the chemotherapy
this is the most common gene that is
associated with the drug resistance in
the chemo chemotherapy okay
so apart from this the third gene that
you have to make a notice bcl-xl okay
few people they call it as BCL x okay
few people they call it as bcl-xl okay
so these are the four genes that you
have to
and most of your questions will move
around this for genes the next one is a
pop TOEIC chains okay so what are they
okay so coming to this there is
something called as BH group few people
call it as BH 3 group a few people call
it as pH group so the BH group proteins
proteins are called as stress sensors
okay they are called as stress sensors
whenever the whenever whenever the
whenever there is stress or diversion to
the cell they get activated so they are
called as stress sensors sensors and
most of these are named as beam big bad
Puma
knocks ah okay all these are examples of
this BH 3 or BH group of rock regimes so
most of your questions will move around
this area so apart from this it is
better if you make a note about other
genes that is b CL s X and BAC and bak
and p53 okay so these are the there's a
bit of controversy regarding this in few
areas but most of your questions can be
handled by these two these examples are
very very important ok so make a note
about these examples they're going to
ask all of the following belongs to
appropriate genes accept all these are
regularly asked questions I'm just going
to have a quick recap so this is
basically extrinsic and intrinsic
intrinsic means inside the cell that is
mitochondria permeability increases
cytochrome C is released cytochrome C is
going to react with APA f1 to form
apoptosis or which is going to activate
capsaicin and this is one method other
method is cytochrome mitochondrial
permeability increases SMC and dabbler
going to release they're going to
inhibit the inhibiting protein by which
they are going to activate capsaicin and
so ultimate goal of intrinsic inside
pathways activation of not coming to
external SiC pathway which is present
the external surface that is called as
death receptor pathway so basically FS
is the transmembrane chain which is
rotated on CD 95 and this is going to
react with the ligate to form a complex
this complex is going to activate 8 and
10 and specifically in humans
okay so 8 and 10 are going to be the end
product of the extrinsic pathway 9 is
the end product of intrinsic pathway
both are going to activate the next
level that is 3 and 6 capsizes so 3 and
6 capsizes are going to activate
endonucleases endonucleases are going to
damage the cell this is what the process
of apoptosis is so next one just want to
add it add what that is what is the
meaning of capsules this is one recently
asked ok capsules are a series of
proteolytic or protein splitting engines
in a series of protein split in you
house 3 you have 6 you have 7 you have 9
8 and all these are thereby mainly
concerned with 9 in the intrinsic 8 and
10 in the extrinsic and further going to
activate 3 & 6 so there are series of
protein splitting enzymes and if you
break the word capsules okay
C stands for system so C stands for
system protein s c stands for system
protein s ASP stands for aspartic acid
and the last one is a stands for enzymes
just make a note of this because C was
given as a question in one of the
examinations apart from this just to
please do make a note of water antigens
what are normal genes and the examples
are important because they are regularly
asking in this area I think this is more
than sufficient for a from from a dental
student point of view okay my stall will
try to solve secures in rapid fire in
the evening session

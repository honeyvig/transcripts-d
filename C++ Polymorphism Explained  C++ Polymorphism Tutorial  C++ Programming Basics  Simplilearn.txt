hey everyone welcome back to another
video session by simply learn
in this session we will learn about c
plus polymorphism
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
so we'll start with what is polymorphism
in c plus plus then types of
polymorphism in c plus plus that is
compile time and runtime we'll also
study function overloading and operator
overloading under compile time
polymorphism
and under runtime polymorphism we will
learn about
function overriding and virtual function
in c plus but before we begin make sure
to subscribe to our channel and press
the bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
so what is polymorphism in c plus plus
polymorphism is an important topic of c
plus plus oops concept
the word polymorphism is derived from
two words that is poly which means many
and morphs which means forms so
basically it means many forms
polymorphism in c plus plus can be
defined as when the member function or
the object behaves differently in
different situations or circumstances
then it can be called as polymorphism
for example
a mother has different relationships
with different family member inside the
house for example she is a parent to her
child
she is a wife to her husband
she has sister to her brother and she is
also a daughter to her parents
so we can say a mother as a single
entity has different behavior among
different members
and same goes for polymorphism where
functions behave differently in
different situations
now
let's understand the types of
polymorphism
there are two types of polymorphism in c
plus plus that is compile time
polymorphism and runtime polymorphism
so let's start with compile time
polymorphism
as the name suggests
this type of polymorphism occurs during
the compile time and it is achieved by
overloading the function or overloading
the operator
that is by function overloading or
operator overloading
so what is this function overloading
function overloading is a feature in c
plus plus
where the functions having the same name
but different in terms of parameters or
type of parameters can be overloaded
for example as you can see two functions
with same name func differ in the type
of arguments one data type is double
another data type is integer
so when we make a call to the function
with arguments of type double it will
invoke the suitable function and the
same goes for the other one
in example 2 there is a difference in
number of parameters
among functions
so while calling the function if we pass
two arguments it will invoke the first
function and if we will pass three
arguments then it will invoke the second
function
then
next is operator overloading
like functions operators can also be
overloaded
in operator overloading we can redefine
the functionality of the operator
it helps us in redefining the already
existing operator
for example
instead of writing sum equals
s1 dot add
s2 we can easily write
sum equals s1 plus s2
that is we can redefine the plus
operator and use it to add the numbers
in the operator function
and we will discuss the syntax of
operator overloading in the examples
now coming to runtime polymorphism
in this type of polymorphism the
functions are invoked during the
execution of program
that is during runtime
this runtime polymorphism can be
achieved through function overriding
so let's understand this function
overriding
in function overriding the function of
the base class gets a new definition in
the derived class in this more than one
function has the same name and same type
of parameters
the only difference is in the definition
of both the functions
that is functions have different
definitions in the parent class and the
child class
as you can see in the example
void message function has a different
definition in the parent class and in
the child class
both have the same name
but in parent class it is printing hello
there and in child class it is printing
nice to meet you
by using the object of the base class or
derived class we can invoke the suitable
function
so let's move on to our next topic that
is virtual function
virtual function is also used to achieve
runtime polymorphism
it is a function that is defined in the
base class and then is redefined in the
derived class the function is defined
using the word virtual in the base class
and the name of the function is same as
that of the derived class having
different definitions as shown
it tells the compiler to perform the
late binding on the function in derived
class
the function call is resolved at runtime
and in late binding and the compiler
determines the object type at runtime
with the help of virtual function we can
invoke the derived version of the
function in the derived class
so as we have covered the theoretical
aspect of c plus polymorphism so let's
go ahead and cover the practical aspect
of this topic in our code editor that is
vs code if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scale up by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more
so here we will make a new file
and let's name it as
poly1 dot cpp all right
poly1 dot cpp
let's save it so here we will do an
example of function overloading which is
used to achieve compile time
polymorphism and we know function
overloading is a feature in c plus
source in which two functions have saved
name
but differ in terms of parameters or
number of parameters or the type of
parameters can be overloaded so let's
start
first of all we'll write
the header file
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
all right
so now we will create a class king and
inside that class we'll do the
overloading
so
the class name is king
and inside the class first of all
let's make public scope
now we'll create a function
return type is void
and the name of the function would be
pro
inside this function let's say we are
passing two arguments
into a and b
all right now
we'll print both of these
arguments or variables inside this
function
all right and we'll use ndl in the end
okay
after that we'll create another
function and the name of the function is
same that is pro
and but in this case we'll make the
arguments like int a
and b
and
c into d
and int e
so there are five arguments in this
function second function pro
as we know that the name of the function
is same
and
now inside this function
we'll simply add all of these
so a plus b plus c plus d
plus e
all right once we are done with this
we'll use semicolon in the end of the
class
all right now we'll start with the main
function inside the main function
all right inside the main function
we will create
the object of king class king and the
object would be k
with the help of this object k we will
call these
functions
as we know the name of the functions are
same the only difference is in the
number of arguments
so
so i'll call the pro function
which accepts only two arguments
so the first pro
function will be invoked
so i'll pass 10
and 20
so these two arguments will be passed
over here
all right
similarly
now we'll call the pro function again
but
now we'll pass five arguments
so that the second pro function would be
invoked
so let's say i am passing
12
23
20
and 62
6
these are some random numbers
all right now return 0
in the end
now let's try to run this i think we are
done with this
first of all let's save it and now let's
right run this
so this is our output 10 20 let's make
it
let's multiply both of them
it will look good let's save it and run
it again
as you can see 200 and 123 so this is
our output
10 into 20 would become 200 and if we
add all of these we'll get 123. so this
is our correct output so this was the
example of function overloading and
let's start with another example
so now let's create a new file
and name this file as
only 2.cpp
alright we have saved it
now here we will do an example of
operator overloading as we know that in
operator overloading we give definition
to already existing operators
or we can say we can redefine the
functionality of already existing
operators
so let's start
first of all we'll include the header
files as we have done previously
hash include iostream
then the name space standard
so first of all we'll start with the
main function
and inside the main function
we will
write the name of the class that we will
create
and
the object let's say the name of the
object is one
and
will pass
the arguments to the constructor
let's say the argument is six and eight
all right
then i think we can write return 0
and we'll do the rest
afterwards first of all we will create
the class
so as we know that the name of the class
is overload so let's create it
class
overload
and inside this class
inside the private scope
we'll start with
the variables let's say the first
variable is n1
and
let's declare another variable n2
then we will create the public scope
inside this we will create the
parameterized constructor
so
it is of same name as that of the class
that is overload
and now as the constructor is
parameterized
so into num1 and num2 are the parameters
so when we'll create this object oven
and we'll pass these arguments so it
will go here
and
all right inside this in the definition
of this constructor
we will create a we will declare the
variable res
and we will assign
num to n1
we'll assign
num2 to n2
and let's say we'll do the subtraction
all right
n1 minus
n2
all right now we will
display
the result that is res
so
res
and then the variable res
after that we'll use zendell
all right
so
once you're done with this parameterized
constructor then
we will create a operator function
so void is the return type
then we will write
operator keyword
this is the syntax of operator function
then after writing the keyword we'll
write the symbol let's say minus is the
symbol
then the arguments if there are any
arguments then we can put those
then inside the function that is in the
definition we can perform whatever the
functionality we want to perform
so let's say in this case we'll just
make the numbers negative
so we'll do that
all right
now we'll do the calling part of this
we will simply use the symbol and the
operator
and this is how we call the operator
function
this is very simple and after that we
have to display the
digits as well as we have made them
negative in this part
so we'll
create a function display
and inside this function we will display
those
digits or numbers
so we'll write
n1
all right after this we'll write
we'll do same for n2
so
we'll write n2
and 2 then
there is endl in the end
all right so here we are displaying this
so once we are done with this the class
is finished so we can use the semicolon
in the end
and we have to call this void function
as well so
we will write
one dot display
o1 dot
display
all right we are done
let's
see whether it works or not
let's save it
and check it
so as you can see the result is minus 2
that is 6 minus 8 equals minus 2
that is correct and n 1 is minus 6 and n
2 is minus 8 because we have made them
negative inside this operator function
we forgot to add some space in n 2 and n
1 so that is why it is looking like this
but the answer is correct
and this is how we can do the operator
overloading
in this part we have use the return type
then the operator keyword then the
symbol and if there are any arguments
then we can pass those arguments
and if there are not we can put it like
this
so this is our example of operator
overloading let's do another example so
now we'll do an example of function
overriding
so let's name this
poly3.cpp
so in function of writing the function
of base class gets a new definition in
the child class and when we call the
function of the child class using the
object of child class
then the function of base class gets
overridden
so now let's do the example of this
function overriding
i think we have named it wrong
poly3 dot cpp
all right
let's name it four
poly4 dot cpp all right now let's save
it
now
include the header files
using namespace standard
now
we'll start with the class parent
so this is
the base class
and we have named it parent
inside the parent class we will create a
function
for that we will create the public scope
inside
inside the public school we will create
the function print
and
we will display the message
this is the function of parent class or
base class what server
all right
so this is class parent and semicolon in
the end of the class
now we'll clear the child class
child
derived from
parent class
name of the class is parent
similarly we'll do the public scope and
create the function
void
print so it is same function as that of
the above class
and
inside this function will display
this is
the function of
child class
derived class let's say
all right once we are done with this
semicolon in the end and semicolon in
the end of the class as well
then we can create a main function
and inside the main function
we will create the
object of child class child obj
so as we have created the object of
child class or derived class so with the
help of this we will override the
function of the base class
so we'll write obj
dot
print
which is the name of the function so as
you have created the object of child
class so it will call the
derived class or child class function
and in the end let's say return 0
now save it
and try to run this
this is the function of derived class
so as we have expected so it is calling
the child class function
so this function of the parent class
gets overwritten as we have used the
object of child class and call this
function print which is of same name so
this function which is in the child
class gets to print
derived class
so this is our output
so now let's do an example of virtual
function in c plus
virtual functions are defined in the
base class to ensure that
the functions gets overwritten
and
when we use the base class pointer to
hold the derived class object or the
child class object the base class
pointer will always call the base
version of the function and not the
derived version
so to solve this problem we use the
virtual keyword in z plus plus so now
let's start with it
first of all we'll write hash include
iostream
now the namespace standard
now we will create the base class class
base
and then we'll use the public scope
inside the public scope we will create
the virtual
function
use the
virtual
the return type
then the name of the function that is
print
and we have created this virtual
function inside the base class now we'll
print
this is the function inside the base
class as we have done previously in the
previous question
this function
this is the functional base class here
it could be right
all right once you are done with this
we'll close the class by using semicolon
now we'll create the derived class and
we'll name it derived
from the base class whose name is base
itself
now
here we will use the public scope
and we will create the function
of the right class
print function and will print
this is the function of derived class
all right
now we'll use the semicolon
to end the class
now inside the int function int main
function
first of all we will create the pointer
of base class
base
d reference operator b
so we have created the pointer of base
class now we will create the object of
derived class
derived d
so now we will store the address of
derived class object to the pointer of
base class
so let's do that
b which is a pointer of base class
address of operator
the object of derived class
so now we will call the print function
using the pointer of base class and it
will print the derived class function
because
the pointer of base class which we are
using to call the functions points to
the derived class object
so now let's do the calling part
all we need to do is
the pointer and the arrow operator
and the name of the function
that is print
after that we can write return 0
now everything is done let's save this
and
run it
as we can see this is the function of
derived class here we can see
so the derived class function is getting
called which we wanted
so this is an example of virtual
function in c plus
we have used this virtual keyword over
here and
using the
base class pointer
we have code this function
and
and these were some examples of
different topics in polymorphism in c
plus plus you can try some more examples
on these topics it will help you in
understanding this topic in a better way
all right with that we have come to the

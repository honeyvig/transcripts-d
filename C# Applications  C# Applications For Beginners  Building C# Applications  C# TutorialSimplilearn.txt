hey everyone i am vavo kandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel today we will talk about one of
the fascinating topics of c programming
that is c sharp applications
but first let me tell you that we have
daily updates on multiple technologies
so if you are a tech geek looking for a
latest technological advancement then
consider subscribing to our youtube
channel
and don't forget to hit the bell icon so
you never miss an update from simply
launch youtube channel
now to understand this topic we will be
creating a scientific calculator
but before we get into the code for the
scientific calculator we should first
understand what it is and why is it
essential
a scientific calculator is a calculator
that is designed to assist you in
calculating problems in science
engineering and mathematics
it has far more buttons than a standard
calculator which only allows you to
perform the four basic arithmetic
operations like addition subtraction
multiplication and divisor
all these extra buttons enable you to
work with variety of numbers and
problems
such as trigonometric problems
scientific numbers which can be divided
by 10 to the power of 10
pi problems
problems involving logarithmics
the fractional functions
and the probability function
your scientific calculator has some
special buttons that will assist you in
writing your equations for example you
have a special button for scientific
number that automatically adds
multiplication by 10 to a specific
exponent
the exp button is one you are looking
for
you enter your scientific number first
then press the button and enter your
exponent value
you can use these buttons to calculate
the number to any exponent and find the
square root or cube root or any other
root when working with engineering
problems
you also have trigonometric buttons like
sign hatch sine cos edge cos 10 edge and
type
so now without any further ado let's
open visual studio and begin with
scientific calculator code
first let's start with the code we have
added all the necessary namespaces for
this program initially
we are utilizing a system library in our
project as indicated by using the system
statement
this includes classes functions such as
console class and rightline functions
and method
following that we have added
system.collection.generic
which contains the interfaces classes
that define generic groups allowing
users to create strongly typed
calculations
with higher type safety and performance
than non-generic strongly typed arrays
then we have added system dot component
model which provides interfaces for
implementing component runtime and
design time behavior types
that are frequently used to include
system and component model
then we have system.data a dotnet course
namespace is the data namespace
all data providers use these classes
standard classes from this namespace are
data view data view manager data set
data table data row data column and data
relation
next is the system drawing
this class contains methods for drawing
to a display device
then there is system.link
it enables link queries by providing
various types of classes and methods
following that we have incorporated the
dot text
this contains ascii and unicode
character encodings abstract base
classes for converting blocks of
characters to and from blocks of wide
a helper class for manipulating and
formatting the string objects without
generating intermediate string instances
next we have included a
system.threading.tasks
that provides types that simplify
writing concurrent and asynchronous code
finally we have included
system.windows.form library
windows form is a graphical user
interface class library that comes with
dotnet framework
and its primary goal is to provide a
more straightforward interface for
developing desktop tablet or pc
applications
it is also called known as win forms
then there is form 1 a partial class
with the public access specifier
c sharp has a unique feature called
partial classes it has a unique
capability of implementing the
functionality of a single class in
multiple files
which are then combined into a single
class file when the application is
combined
finally a partial keyword is used to
create a partial class
first we have initialized the component
function
in form1 class
in
visualstudio.net c sharp or vb.net the
initialized component method is a method
that is automatically created and
managed by the windows form designer and
defines everything you see on the
form then we have declared four more
variables
first of output and the first number of
double data types
then we have created a choice string
and a casey ptr
of bool data type
which is initially set to false
so for 0 to 9 digits we have event name
as button 1 click
then there is a condition that states
that if a text is equal to zero or
calcium ptr is false then we clear the
text box
then we use variable button of class
button there is another condition if a
text box does not contain a decimal
point then we can text any digit other
than 0 to 9 except the decimal point
otherwise we will add the decimal point
to our text
next we have a backspace button
namely the button 22
which which we use when we had end
integer variable which contains the
length of the text and we decrement end
by one and one removing all the text
written in the text box
if no no text is entered into the text
box the value 0 will be displayed
next in our scientific calculator we
have event name button21 which adds the
text as zero
then we have an event for plus minus
button name button 23
in which we have output variable which
converted double to a string as output
is declared double
initially then if the output is equal to
output multiplication to minus 1 which
means if the output is positive
then it will be negative and if the
output is negative then it will be
positive
then we have event button 24
click
where we convert the first number to
string
then we have choice assigned as a
operator button
and finally calcium ptr is set to true
next we have a button 39 click event
where we have switch case for doing
button operations for plus minus
multiplication and divisor
where the first case it's the number
case 2 defines subtraction which
subtracts a value then multiplication
multiplies the value and division
divides the given number
following that we have a one click event
for the off button which is used to exit
the application
after that we have a button click event
for the logarithmic operation in which
we use the math library to convert our
outputs to log base 10.
following that we have button two three
and four click events for performing
sign edge cos edge and 10h operations in
our scientific calculator with the math
library
the specified angles of hyperbolic sine
cosine and tangent are then written
similarly we have even names as button 7
8 and 9.
these will perform the sine
cosine
and tangent operations
the sine cosine and tan of the specified
angles are then written
the button 10 has a math click event pi
and it represents the circumference to
diameter ratio of a circle
as specified by constant pi
the next button five click event
contains the math dot power
which returns e raised to the power
to a specified number
then we have button 12 click
which has a math dot power of 2
which will give us the square of the
given number
following that
we have a click button 14 to reduce the
given output by 1.
then we have button 13 which has the
math tau of 3 which give us the cube of
the given number
following that we use the button 15
click event to perform the modular
operator which returns the remainder or
signed reminder of the division after
one number is divided by another called
the modulus of the operation
then we have button 17 click event
this event uses the math.log library to
return the logarithmic of a given number
following that we have button 18 click
which will give us the percentile of the
given output divided by the given output
multiplied by 100
and the last but not the least we have
event as button 19 and 20.
click
which has match dot ceiling and math dot
floor library where mat dot ceiling
returns the smallest integral value that
is greater than or equal to the
specified number and math.floor which
returns the most significant essential
value that is less than or equal to the
limited number is returned
now that we are ready to run this code
here is our scientific calculator which
includes the textbook
labels and buttons
now
let's run this code
here's our calculator
let's try to do some calculation
let's add 5 with 4
equals to which is 9
then let's take square root which is 3
then a cube which is 27
now let's try the off button if it will
exit us out of this calculator
and yes
it does
let's get back to our slide
and this was all for today's session

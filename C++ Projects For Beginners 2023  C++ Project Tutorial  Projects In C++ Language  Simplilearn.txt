foreign
in this video tutorial we will be
learning about some C plus plus projects
that would be helpful for you to learn
and grasp C plus programming language in
a practical way
we will not only discuss these projects
but also will make these projects from
scratch using some basic concepts of C
plus
so we will start with the hotel
management project in which we will have
the information of the items or rooms
that we have what food items are ordered
by the customer and how many rooms are
allotted to them Etc
then we will make another project on
registration and login form
in this project we will learn how to
make the complete structure and
functionality of the login and
registration form
first we will learn how to create a
login page in C plus in the menu there
will be different options like
registration login and forgot password
Etc
after that we will make a supermarket
billing project in C plus
in this project there will be various
functions that we will be creating for
this project like add function to add
the goods and products in the market and
delete to delete some products Etc
and at last we will make an airline
registration system in C plus plus this
project on Airline reservation system
will allow a user to book a flight to a
particular country of his choice and he
or she will receive the ticket by
filling in all the important details Etc
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our Channel and press the
Bell icon to never miss an update
now let's go ahead
this project will be a hotel management
project in which we will have the
information of the items or rooms that
we have in the hotel and what are the
food items ordered by the customer
also we have the information that how
many rooms are allotted to them
also this project will tell us about the
sales and the remaining food stocks we
have and the total collection of the day
firstly we'll discuss the first part in
which we will declare some variables and
then initialize them after that we will
enter the quantities of items that we
have in the hotel
then we'll make a list of items or menu
of items and rooms that we have in the
hotel
so let's start
now we'll switch to our code editor that
is Dev C plus plus
so this is a code editor so here first
of all let's make a new file
we'll click on file and now we'll create
a new file
so now let's start with the project so
first of all inside the main function we
have to declare some variables but
before that we will
write the header files that is Hash
include I have stream
and then the namespace standard
foreign
so we have included the header files now
we'll start with the main function
inside the main function
we will declare the variable
so first variable that we'll declare
would be Quant which stands for quantity
and the second variable would be choice
now we will declare those variables that
store the quantity of food items or
rooms
so let's say
the variable which will store the
quantity of rooms would be Q rooms
and
we have to initialize it also
all right so similarly we have to do it
with the food items as well so let us
suppose one of our food item is pasta so
we'll write Q pasta that is quantity
pasta
will initialize it with zero
similarly we'll do with the rest of the
food items
it is Burger
noodles
and Shake
and chicken
a chicken would be let's say chicken
roll
so these are our food items so these
variables will hold the quantity of
these food items
so now we will declare those variables
which will hold the value of the number
of food items that have been sold so for
example Q pasta holds the value of
number of pastas we had in a hotel and
as pasta will hold the value of number
of pastas that have been sold
so let's start
similarly we'll write s rooms that is
sold rooms
we have to initialize it with 0 as well
and as pasta
similarly s Burger
as noodles
as chicken
all right
now we'll create some more variables
that will store the price of the total
price of each of these food items or
rooms so let's do that let's say in
total
underscore rooms this is the variable
name it will store the total price of
the rooms
we'll initialize it with zero similarly
total
pasta
equals zero
total
Burger
all right so these variables holds the
quantity of food we have these variables
holds the quantity of food we sold and
these variables will hold the price the
total price of each of the food items or
rooms so let's
comment it this holds quantity
so that it's easy for you guys
all right so here we have declared these
variables now now we will make a list
kind of a structure in which we will ask
the user to enter the number or
quantities of food items or rooms that
we have in the hotel
so
all right now let's do this
first of all we have to display a
message
but before that we'll use slash in and
slash T So slash N means the next line
and slash T will add a horizontal space
in the output so we need that horizontal
space
so we'll write
foreign
let's say items only quantity of items
we have
we have in a hotel
all right
now
we'll write rooms available
so we'll add slash n and
rooms
available
all right so after this
we will write C in and take the input of
quantity of rooms we have because here
we are asking to enter the number of
rooms we have
so we will write C in
Q rooms because it holds the quantity of
rooms we have
we have initialized it with zero
similarly we'll do it for the rest like
quantity of pasta like this will do
inside the
slash in
now we'll write the quantity of pasta
C in
Q pasta
all right
now similarly
let's copy paste and save some time
so this first was the pasta then Burger
foreign
then there was noodles
shoe noodles
similarly we'll do it for Shake
and then
hit chicken is the chicken roll
so quantity of chicken roll
Q chicken
all right
so
one by one Q room the quantity of rooms
we have to add cue pasta the quantum
pasta we have to add then Quantum Burger
we have
all right now we have to create a menu
to select the pasta Burger room all the
items we have to create a menu like that
and for that let's do this
we'll write C out again we'll use
slash in
slash and then
again slash T slash
D because we want some horizontal space
in that
will display a message saying that
please select from the given menu
options
foreign
so it's a message for the users
or the customers I would say
now again we'll use slashing
because I want to add some new lines
so I'll use two selection
now
foreign
secondly we'll use only one slation
and
here we are creating the menu to select
the food items or rooms
so now we will write
pasta
and similarly we'll copy paste
foreign
chicken roll
we also have to change the numbering
that this is one this is two then this
is three we are doing the numbering
because the customer will press the
number
and then he can order
five
six
and now again we'll
in seventh position We'll add the
details or information
regarding the collection in sales
so
we'll write
press 7 if you want to see the
information
regarding
sales
and collection
this option would be used by the owner
of the hotel to check the total
collection for the day
all right now again
the eighth number
this word
then we want to exit
yeah
so this is done now after that we'll
display a message saying that
please enter your choice
so we'll use slash and slashing and
right
please enter your choice
now I will write C in choice we have
already declared this variable
now based on this Choice your order is
selected like if you press 2 then this
pasta would be selected like let's say
if you want to order noodles then you
have to select four and if you want to
order Chicken Roll then you have to
select six and if you want to check the
total sales and connect collection of
today
that is for a particular day then you
have to click seven and eight for the
exit
so a first part is done now in the
second part we have to add the
functionality to the choice part that is
if a user enters the first number that
is number one then rooms is selected and
then he or she have to add the numbers
of rooms they want
similarly for the other food items as
well like if they want to take two
burgers or three burgers instead of one
and we only have one Burger left then
also we have to display a message saying
that only so and so burgers are left
so now let's start with it
so now we'll write switch case
statements so when the user will select
a particular number
so that particular case would be
executed
so now let's do that
right switch
and
inside the switch statement
we'll write choice
now the choice can be one two three four
five six seven eight
all right so now we have to create eight
cases for that
so case one would be
we'll start with it there's a space
between case and one all right so case
one would be
first of all inside the case one
that is the case when rooms have to be
selected so first of all we'll display a
message saying that enter the number of
rooms you want
so let's do that
use slash n
now
enter the
number of rooms you want
all right
now after that
the user will enter the number of rooms
that is the quantity of rooms
so now we'll take the quantity in the
quantity variable that is Quant variable
so the user will enter the number of
rooms that is the quantity of rooms he
or she wants
now we'll use a if statement and if
statement inside this if statement now
inside this if statement we'll check do
we actually have that many rooms in our
hotel or do we actually have that many
pastas or burgers in our hotel right now
so for that we have to write down a
condition that is
Q rooms minus s rooms
is greater than equal to Quant
that is
Q rooms is the quantity of rooms that we
have and S rooms the number of rooms
that we have sold
so if we minus both of these that is if
you subtract the quantity of room we
have
minus the rooms we have sold we'll get
the remaining rooms now if the remaining
rooms it's greater than equal to the
quantity of rooms that have been ordered
by the customer then we can give the
room to them otherwise we have to
display a message saying that we don't
have that many rooms or something like
that
so let's do that so we'll write s rooms
that is the rooms that we have sold so
initially its value is zero so we have
to add the values of quantity that have
been
entered by the user so we'll add the
Quant variable that is if the user have
entered two rooms he or she wants then
we'll add the add those two values to
this sold rooms
all right after adding the quantity to
the sold rooms now
we will do the total price of the room
or rooms and for that we have the
variable total
room
so we'll add this Quant into the price
of a one room to this total room
so we are simply adding
total room Plus
Quant
into the price of a single room that is
let's say 1200 is the price of a single
room
if a person orders two rooms then it
would be like Quant that is 2 2 into
1200 2400 will be added to this total
room this total room is the total price
of a room
all right
now we also have to display a message
saying that these many rooms have been
allotted to you so for that let's
display a message first of all we'll use
slash n like two times now
we'll add some horizontal space as well
all right now we'll display this Quant
variable
and write a message that these many
rooms
have been
allotted to you
let me let's make it rumor rooms
room or rooms have been allotted to you
so this message will be displayed
all right now this is the if block
now we'll have to make the else block
that
if the
amount or quantity of room entered by
the user is more than the remaining
rooms then we'll display a message
saying that only so and so rooms are
left in the hotel
so we'll use slash n then again slash d
now we'll write
only
Q rooms
minus s rooms that is hit Q root minus s
room is the remaining rooms are the
remaining rooms so subtracting both of
these variables will give us the
remaining rooms
so these were the remaining rooms
and
Hotel
all right
and let's not add this as there's a
single statement
also we have to use break
so we'll use break statement now
similarly we have to create case two
this case was for the room
so whenever a user click on this one
then this case will be executed so
similarly we'll create case two
so let's
we'll copy it now we'll paste it
so
I will case to
so in this case enters the number of
rooms you want to become we can't write
that so we'll write pass the quantity so
let's do that
we'll write
enter
pass the
quantity
all right so in this case the C in would
be same that is quantity variable we
have so now in this case the different
thing would be the Q rooms instead of Q
rooms will use the Q pasta that is the
quantity of pasta
minus sold pastas
it must be greater than quantity of
pasta we have
then only if block will execute
otherwise similarly as that of this
block will display a message
so now the S rooms instead of s rooms
here will use as pasta
which is initially zero
so we'll add the quantity of pasta to
this variable that is We'll add the
quantity of pasta that is ordered by the
customer to this variable
now total pasta that is a total price of
the pasta
so the number of pastas ordered by the
customer into the price of a single
pasta let's say the price of a single
pasta is around 250.
so quantity into 250.
now
rooms instead of rooms let's do here
pasta is the order
so Quant
so Quant will display the
quantity so it will display like if you
have ordered two pastas will it will
display two
pass the
is the
order
and
Q rooms here we have to display the
remaining so we'll do the Q pass the
minus
as pasta
and here we'll do is pass the remaining
in hotel or stock
pass the remaining in hotel
so it will display the remaining pasta
remained in the hotel now
so
else everything is fine now similarly
we'll do for the next
we'll copy it it will save some time
and paste it now this is case three the
case three is of burger
so we will write
Burger
quantity of burger minus
sold burgers
similarly as Burger
now the total price of burger
so let's say the price of a burger is
around 120
and so
the remaining burgers
Q value minus Asperger
the fourth case now
that is the noodles case
so enter noodles quantity
now case five
now case 5 is of shakes
so we'll write enter shakes quantity
now
case six we have to create
in the case six there was chicken rule
so let's do that
Q chicken
minus s chicken
also we have to change the price of each
meal like chicken roll
would be of around 150
and this shake would be
120
noodles
140 let's say
Burger is okay then
pasta is also okay
so we have created six cases as of now
so our second part of the program is
done now we'll start with the third part
of the program
so the third part will contain the case
7 case 8 and the default case that is if
the user enters any other number which
is not in the list that will come under
default case
in case 7 we have to display the
information of sales and collection that
is how many
money we have collected for the day and
the remaining food items Etc
so now let's start with the case seven
so when the user will enter 7 that is
case 7
then he want to see the details of the
information of sales and collection
so we'll display a message saying that
details
of sales
and
collection
all right
so after this message let's add slashing
slash T slash t
all right so after this message
we have to display the number of rooms
we had the number of rooms we gave for
rent and then the remaining rooms that
is minus the quantity of rooms minus the
sold rooms then the total rooms
collection for the day
so similarly we'll do for all the meals
like pasta Burger Noodles Etc so let's
do it
so we'll start
display
first of all We'll add slashing
now
number of rooms we had
we'll display Q rooms that is the
quantity rooms we had
now
similarly
number of rooms
we give for rent
all right
so we'll write
s rooms
now we have to display a message
similarly we'll write slash and slash n
meaning
rooms
so for that we have to Simply subtract Q
rooms with s rooms that will give us the
remaining rooms
after that
the total price that the room has
collected or number of rooms have
collected
so we'll write
total rooms
collection
for the day
now
it is stored at total rooms
this variable is stored in the total
drives of rooms
this is the complete information of
rooms similarly we have to do it for the
burger noodle pasta Etc
so we can copy we'll copy this part
and we'll do
copy and paste
and paste
again we'll paste now number of rooms we
had instead of this we'll simply write
number of pastas we had
number of pastas
we have to change that number of pastas
we
sold
yeah that would be right now remaining
past us
there are few minor changes that we have
to do
total pasta collection
also make sure to change the variables
total hasta
then
Q pasta
all right now
after pasta it was Burger
Burgers we have number of burgers we
sold
all right so it would be Q Burger
and that's Burger
remaining burgers
total Burger collection for the day
all right now we'll do same for
noodles
all right now shakes
number of shakes we had
number of shakes we gave
we sold
remaining shakes
now there is chicken roll
number of chicken rule we had
all right now the case eight the case
eight we have used four this was the
case seven and the case eight we have
used for exit as you can see here
this is the exit case
and for that
we'll simply use
the exit statement the exit statement is
used to terminate the program to shift
the control out of the program or exit
the program
so here we'll use that so case 8 would
be
exit and inside that will use 0 0 will
mean that zero millisecond
and now after that we'll have to use the
default case that if the user enters any
other number that is not present in the
menu list then this default case will be
executed so in this default case we'll
display a message saying that please
select from the numbers that are
mentioned above
so we'll use lesson
please
select the numbers
mentioned above
so this message will be printed
and also one more thing is there
we have to use a go to statement
and we'll have to label a part with m
now I'll explain to you that why have we
used this jump statement that is go to
statement
so after making a choice we again want
to choose another option that is if I
have ordered two pastas then I also want
to order two burgers as well so we will
Mark or label menu with M so this is a
menu please select from the menu options
so here we will label m
and
in the last we have used the go to
statements so the go to statement here
will transfer the control to the menu
after making a choice
so again m is the label we have used for
the menu and we will use a go to
statement to transfer the control to the
menu after making the choice so that we
can make more choices
go to is a jump statement basically that
is used to jump from one part to another
part having a specified label
so we have labeled menu with M and this
go to jump state will help us in jumping
to the menu after every choice
all right so our code is done we have
done all the things that we need now we
need to run it and for that firstly we
need to save it
all right so let's go to files and save
it
and now let's
select the destination folder
let's name it as management
.cpp
foreign
all right
so the program is saved now let's try to
compile and run this program
so there are some errors I can see
Okay so
we have used the semicolon
now this will take care of many errors
now let's try to again compile and run
let's check Q noodles
all right I think uh
Q noodles
so we have two Backspaces now
let's try to
compile and run again
hope it works now
so quantity of items we have as we can
see
so rooms available let's say we have 10
rooms
and quantity of pasta
we have 25 Pastors in our hotel and
around 50 burgers
and 30 noodles
and 30 shakes
Chicken Roll we have 40
so this is the menu please select from
the menu options as we can see First
rooms then pasta Burger noodles Shake
Chicken Roll information regarding sales
and collection and then eight to exit so
first of all let's say I want to order
two rooms so I'll click one
please enter your choice I have clicked
one and I'll press enter now enter the
number of rooms you want and let us
suppose I want two rooms
so as we can see
two room or rooms have been allotted to
you now again the menu is displayed on
the screen now let's say I want
Burgers so I'll click on three
and I want two burgers
and two Burger is the order it is
displayed now again I want uh
pasta let's say
I want six pastas
and six past ID order I want to order
now shakes
let's have something to drink I want to
order nine shakes
nine shakes is the order
and let's say so as we know that we have
only 10 rooms now let's try to enter 11
so first of all we'll enter one that is
rooms now let's try to order 11 rooms
as you can see only eight
eight rooms available or remaining in
hotel so we forgot to add some space
over this part
but we can easily read it now as of now
so it is displaying the message that
only eight rooms are available because
already we have ordered two early it was
10 then now only eight rooms are
available so this is showing that if we
order
more than the quantity then it will
display this message
now let's say I want to
check the information regarding sales
and collection of two days
rooms and as well as meals so I'll
simply click on seven
now as we can see it will simply display
all the
sales and collection
rooms and meals as you can see number of
rooms we had 10 number of rooms we gave
for rent two remaining rooms are eight
so total rooms collection for the race
2400 as one room is of 1200 so similarly
number of pastas we had 25 number of
pastas we sold six remaining pastors we
had 19 so the total pasta collection is
1500 so and so the Burger and then
noodles and then shakes and chicken roll
so this is the total Chicken Roll
collection for the day
that is that is we haven't ordered a
single Chicken Roll also we can do one
more thing we can simply
display the total result of all the
collections of rooms and meals
so let's do that
so now so to display the total
collection of the day all we need to do
is to add all the totals of pastas
burgers and rooms
so for that we have to go to case seven
foreign
three times
so here we'll write total collection for
the day
and after that
total rooms
Plus
total
total burgers
total pasta
this total
Burger
total
chicken
all right after this we will use the
break statement
now let's run the program
so here it is Rooms available
let's write 10
quantity of pasta 30
Burger 50.
quantity of noodles 30.
shakes 30
chicken roll
40.
so first of all I'll book two rooms
click on one and now two rooms
and again if I'll click on
rooms
and then if I try to click
10 rooms because already we have two
sold we sold two rooms and it will
display that only eight rooms remaining
in hotel now I'll
click on two to order pasta let's say I
have ordered five pastas
and
five pasta is the order now let's say if
we click on nine although we know that
only one to eight numbers are available
but if we click on 9
so it will display message please select
the numbers mentioned above
all right now let's say I have I want to
order chicken roll
10 chicken rolls I want
so 10 chicken roll is the order now I
want to check information regarding
sales and connection for the day
right click on 7
and then here I can see
number of rooms we had number of rooms
we gave for rent remaining rooms and
total collection for the day similarly
for the pasta similarly for the burger
similarly for noodles
shakes and
Chicken Roll as well
and this is the total collection for the
day five one five zero exit and if we
click on it we can exit
so as we can see this is our hotel
management project
and this is how it's done
the code is bit long but it's worth it
you can also try this project on your
own this project will be a login and
registration system in C plus plus
in which a user can register login and
also if he or she forgets the password
then also it can be recovered
we will make this project using the
fundamentals of C plus plus like switch
case statements and file handling
operations
Etc
so let's go ahead and understand this C
plus plus project of login and
registration system
in this project first of all we will
make a menu page in which there are
options like login registration for good
password and exit
then we'll ask the user to select anyone
among those options
once the user has selected a particular
option then we have to continue with the
functionality of that
so now let's switch to a code editor and
do its practical implementation
so this is a Dev C plus plus code editor
and now let's create a new file
now first of all we will include the
header files
the hash include iostream
then there is
F stream class or file handling
operation
hash include fstream
then there is string dot Edge
for string
then we will include the namespace
standard
now we will do the forward declaration
for three functions that is login
function registration function and
forgot function
and after that inside the main function
we will make the menu for the login page
so let's start
first of all we are doing the forward
declaration
this is the login function
this is the registration function
and this is the forward function
now inside the int Main
first of all we'll make a variable C
which stands for Choice C for choice
so now
we will make the menu page
so let's create
we'll use
slash t for adding the horizontal space
now in the end we will use slash n
all right similarly we'll do here
welcome to
the login page
now again we'll do the same
slash t
slash T slash t
and now
underscores
menu
slash and slashing
all right now we will make the options
so we'll do the slash t
now after slash T we'll add vertical bar
then
we'll right press one
to login
let's make it capital
press 1 to login
and after making some space then
vertical
drag it again
then handle
similarly
we'll copy it and do for option two
press two
register
all right
let's maintain the symmetry
press three
if you forgot your password all right
press 4 to exit
foreign
so this is done now after that we will
ask the user to enter your choice and
for that we'll display a message saying
that
please enter your choice
but before that we'll use slash in and
some slash D's
all right now we'll ask the user please
enter your choice
all right
now we'll take the input of the choice
that is C that we have already declared
next line now we'll use switch case
statements for example if the user
selects two to register first of all
then inside the switch case statement in
case 2 we will call the registration
function
and if the user enters one then we will
call the login function
so let's do that
let's create a switch statement
and see that is choice
now inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create a case one
inside this case there would be login
we are calling this login function and
then there is break statement
all right similarly now we will
create case two
so case 2 would be registration
here we are calling the registration
function
and then there is break statement
in case three there is forgot function
that is if the user forgets the password
then this function will be implemented
now
there is a default case no now there is
a case for
in case 4 there would be a message
saying that thank you
because ks4 would be exit
so we'll display a message saying that
now we'll also have to make the default
case
that is if the user selects five six or
any other number that is not in the menu
then we will display a message saying
that
please select from the options given
above
so before that we'll add the slash t
please select
from the options
given above
after that we'll use slash n
and L
after that we'll call the main function
so that the control goes back to the
main function and
will also use
system
CLS that is clear screen
it means every time the code is
processed it will clear up the screen
now all we need to do is to create the
login function
so we'll write void
login
and inside this function first of all
we'll create some variables and so let's
do that and count
uh user ID no this user ID would be of
string
right
string
user ID
then there would be password
then ID
then pass
all right so these are the variables
that we have created
now again we'll use this
system CLS
that is clear screen
we have to
write CLS inside the double quotes
all right now we will display a message
that please enter the username and
password
so we'll do that
and we'll write slash T slash T slash d
and
please enter
the username
and password
all right now
will again display a message saying that
username
now we'll take the input
so here user ID is the username that the
user will enter
now again we will display a message
saying that password
let's make it capital
again we'll take the input
now as the user has entered the username
and password now we will check that if
that username and password already exist
in our records
and for that we will use the file
handling operation of if stream class
because if stream is used to read the
data so we will use if strain
and if stream class
this will read the data from the file
input is the object name
and the file name would be records
Dot txt
all right we'll have to
make it inside the double quotes
all right so now this if stream will
check inside the file that if that login
password exists or not
and to check that we will have to use
the while loop
inside the while loop we'll write
input that is the object name
then there would be ID
and there
pass
so this is the ID and password and this
is how we read in file handling
operations here what we are doing is we
are reading that if
that ID and password is there and then
we will match those ID and passwords
with the ID and password that is entered
by the user
so for that we will have to use the if
condition inside the while loop
so let's do that we will write if
ID equals user ID
and
pass equals password
then
count would be
1.
and then we will use system CLS to clear
the screen
here we have assigned 1 to count because
in the next part we will use an if
condition that if the count is 1 then we
will display a message saying that your
login is successful that is the password
or username entered by the user matches
with the record that is the user has
already registered
so now before that we have to close this
file
so
let's do that
we'll to close this file we will use the
object name that is input Dot close this
is how we can close the file
all right now we'll use the if condition
and inside this if condition
as I have said if count equals 1
all right if count equals one
then we will first of all display the
user ID that is the username
and then we will display a message that
your login is successful
so let's do that
your login
is successful
now thanks for logging in
now again we will
shift the control to the main
because there is the main menu
and now
inside the else block
we will display a message
that is if the user and password is not
found inside the file then it means that
the user is not registered so he can't
log in he has to register it first so
we'll display a message
saying that
foreign error
please check your username
now again
main function now we have to create
another function that is the
registration function
that is if the user press 2 then this
registration function
would be called
so let's create this function
void registration
now inside this function we will first
of all create some variables then after
that we'll ask the user to enter the
username and password pretty much the
same as that of the previous function so
first of all string
are for registration user
ID our user ID
then r
password
then our ID and R pass
system CLS again clear screen
all right
now we will display a message saying
that enter the username
again
enter the password
or password
all right so in the previous function we
have used if stream class but in this
function we will use off stream class
because we want to write inside the file
and offstream helps us with that
so for that we will use off stream
and the object name would be F1
and Records user file
and we will use the
app mode this iOS mean the input output
stream and app will open the file and
append the output in the end
so this is our app mode there are
different modes so here we are using
this app mode
so after this we'll put the semicolon in
the end
now we have to write inside the file so
we'll do the F1
and this is how we write inside the file
F1 here is the object name and our user
ID
is the username and after that we'll add
some space
and then
are
password
that is the password
we want some space between the username
and password that is why we have
use the single quotes and
this is how we write inside the file and
after that we'll again use the system
CLS that is the clear screen
all right
now I will display a message that
registration is successful
as we have already written inside the
file so now we can display this message
saying that registration is successful
now again
control back to the main function
so now we will create the forgot
function
this is the last function
void forgot
so this function
would be called when the user forgots
the password or username
so first of all we will create a
variable
option
now we will ask the user that you forgot
your password no worries then we'll ask
the user to press 1 to search your ID by
by your username and press 2 to go back
to the main menu
so let's start
before that we will use system CLS
all right now we'll display the message
saying that
you forget the password
no worries
and then
leave slash in
now press one
to search
your ID
by username
all right now
press 2 to go back to the main menu
all right now after that
we'll use slash d
all right now enter your choice
now we'll take the input C in
option
after that using the switch case
statement
option
now inside the switch case
we will create cases
so case 1
that is when the user selects option one
then
hint
will use bracket over here because there
will be
multiple lines
all right now end count
will initialize it with zero
now some more variables we will declare
this string
s user ID
and
S ID
then s pass
so these are some string variables and
count is the integer variable after that
we'll display a message that enter the
username which you remembered
so let's do it
to the username
if you remembered
all right
now
we will take the input from the user as
user ID
so once the user entered the username
then we will check
that if that username exists in the file
using the if stream object as we know if
stream is used when we want to read from
the file or check from the file so we'll
create the if stream class
and the object name would be F2
and
records.txt is the file
all right now using the while loop
we will check that if
the username is there inside the file or
not
so S ID
and S pass
so now
if
S ID equals
as user ID
then
count equals 1.
so we will assign one to count and
after that we will close the file it is
F2
load close
so here what we are doing is we are
checking inside the file using the
stream object that if that ID or
password is there and if that ID is
there then we'll assign one to the count
as initially it was 0 and then again
we'll do the same as that we have in the
pre as we have done in the previous
function that if count equals to 1 then
we will
print a message that your account is
found
so let's do that
so as we have closed the file now after
that
we'll use an if statement
with a condition that if
count equals 1
then we will print a message saying that
your account is found
foreign
so it will display the password
again the control will be shifted to the
main
where there is the main menu
and inside the else block now
inside the else block will display a
message
saying that
sorry your account is not found
sorry
your account
is not found
so as the case one ends we will use the
break statement
now we will create case two
in case 2 as we have said that it will
simply call the
go back to the main menu so
all we'll do is
call the main function
so that the control will go back to the
main menu
and now also we have to create the
default case
in the default case we'll simply print a
message saying that wrong choice please
try again
so we'll use slash T slash slash t
wrong choice
please try again
foreign
we'll call the forgot function so that
the user can try again with the correct
option
all right so
we forgot to save this
so let's name it as
register
dot CPP
and save it
now let's try to run this
go to execute and compile and run
there is some error
all right so it must I must be capital
as we have declared
let's try again
so as you can see welcome to login page
this is the menu and this is press one
to login press 2 to register press 3 if
you forgot your password press 4 to exit
so now we will enter our choice first of
all we need to register so we'll write 2
and our username as
Sam at the rate email
this is a username
and now our password
sam123 is a password
so as we can see the message
registration is successful
after that we will login
as we have registered now we'll try to
login
Sam Android email is our username
and Sam
one two three other password
so as you can see your login is
successful thanks for logging in
now let's say I forgot my password
so I'll press three as if you forgot
your password you have to press three
so there is a message you forgot the
password nowhere is please press one to
search your ID by your username so I'll
press one
now I'll write my username the last
username I remembered
Sam at the rate
email
so your account is found your password
is this as you can see
so let's say
again if I forgot the password and by
chance I write
Sammy
at the rate email
then sorry your account is not found is
displayed as Sam at the rate email is
the registered customer and not Sammy at
the rate email so it will display this
message that sorry your account is not
found
and let's say
again if we try to press let's say 5
then we can see that please select from
the options given above actually we have
to make it below options given below but
we can do that else everything is
working fine so now we will click on
exit that is four
and this is a message thank you
so as we can see this is our
registration and login
system in C plus plus and this is how we
can do it we have created these three
functions that is login function
then there is registration function
after that there is a forgot function if
you forgot the password and the code is
pretty easy and not that much long so
you can try this code on your own so in
this session we will learn how to create
a supermarket billing project in C plus
we will create this project in small
parts as there are various functions
that we will be creating for this
project like the add function to add the
goods and products in the market and
delete function to delete some products
Etc
also we will create a buyer site where
the buyer can buy the products or food
items of his choice
now we will move to our code editor that
is Dev C plus plus
so now let's create a new file
and we'll start with adding the header
files first of all we'll add hash
include I have stream
then we'll include the app stream file
right hash include fstream because here
we have to do the file handling
operations as well so we'll add the
fstream file
now we'll write the namespace standard
now let's save this one and name it
billing one dot CPP
all right so we have named this file
now first of all we'll create a class
and we will declare some variables and
functions
so let's create a class and name the
class as shopping
inside the class shopping first of all
inside the private scope we will create
or declare some variables
P code
then float type
price
then another variable discount or flow
type
then name which would be string
all right let's name it P name
P stands for product
all right now inside the public scope we
will declare the functions
so
let's name this function as menu
because we have to create the menu then
administrator function
foreign
function
a buyer or customer whatsoever
all right now let's create add function
then the edit function
these definitions of these functions we
will create later first of all here we
are declaring these functions after that
we have to remove some products for that
we will create remove function and then
the list function to display the list
and at last
receipt function
all right so here we have declared the
functions and the variables
so now we'll put semicolon in the end of
the class
and we'll start with the first function
that is the menu function
so we'll write wide class name
then the scope resolution operator
and menu function
foreign
so now inside this function
first of all we will create a
variable
that is choice
and some more variables like let's say
email
and password
because here we will need email as well
as password for the login purpose
so now we have to create this menu and
for that we have to first of all display
Supermarket main menu and after that we
will display that administrator buyer
Etc and
all that so now let's start with that
for that we have to display and you can
display in your own style like I usually
do like this
slash T to add some horizontal space
it's just for formatting and
after that same will do
thank you
to save some time let's just copy and
just paste it
and but now we will here we will write
supermarket
main menu
reduce some space
foreign
[Music]
now let's just copy and paste this part
all right now again some space
stuff
all right now we'll create a menu in
which the user have to select the
customer have to select whether he is an
administrator or a buyer
so let's do that
and for that
right C out
slash T slash T slash D to add some
horizontal space
and
all right now
administrator
now similarly I will do for
we'll add some space over here
just remove this one
in number two we'll write buyer
the person who wants to buy stuff
from the market
all right
no
let's format it
we'll add some space over here
now in number three we'll write exit
all right it's pretty much done
after that again if you want to add some
space we can
add some
it's just for formatting purposes you
can do it in your own way and after that
we have to display a message saying that
please select
so we'll display a message
for good to use semicolon
now we'll take an input from the user
that
whatsoever he wants to click on like if
he is an administrator he'll click on N1
if he's a buyer then he'll click on Two
And if he wants to exit you can click on
three
so we will take an input of choice now
we have to use switch case
and let's create that
switch and inside this will write choice
we all know how switch case works
all right now for case 1 that is
administrator case
we will ask the user to enter the login
credentials if he or she is an
administrator
so let's just do that
so first of all we'll display a message
saying that please login
so slash T slash t
enter email and then
we'll take the input of email we already
declared this variable
email and now we'll take the password
from the user
now I will take the input of the
password
so as we have taken the email and
password from the user now we will set
an email and password that only admin
knows and no other person can enter that
and let's say
for that we have to use if else
statements so if
email
equals
now let's set the email first of all
Robbie at the rate email.com
you can write the email and password as
of your choice
and I'll set the password now as
Robbie at the rate one two three
now inside the if block if the user
enters this that means it is the
administrator
and we will call this administrator
function
all right now in the else block
will simply display a message saying
that invalid username password
invalid username
invalid email password
all right after that we'll use the break
to end the case
now we will create case 2 case 2 is for
the buyer so we'll write case
2 and in this case we'll simply call the
buyer function
so this is the case too and now we have
to create the case three
inside the case three
case three is for exit so we'll do Exit
0
it means successful termination of the
program
Now default case
foreign
so inside the default case we'll simply
display a message saying that
please select from the given options
default case will execute if a person
selects any other option
rather than one two three
so we'll have to instruct him that
please select from the given option
select from the
given options
now after this we'll use a go to
statement
after the switch statement
so go to is a jump statement so it will
help us in jumping to the main menu
again
after the completion of this switch case
and this m is a label we have to put
this label at the starting of this
menu
so let's do that
right m
now coming back to the next function
so this function is done
so we'll close this function
all right so now we will create an
administrator function in which there
will be different options inside the
administrator menu so now let's start
with that
so we will write
void shopping that is the class name
crop resolution operator
administrator
so our function name is admined in
straight up
so inside this function first of all we
will declare a variable choice
now after that we will
create a menu in which there will be
different options
so
let's do that
first of all we'll write slash in
then slash D some horizontal spaces
so that administrator
menu
all right
after that
will be our first option
so first of all we'll write slash and
then slash D's
just to make it bit fancy we can do this
add the product
so the user can select this option if he
wants to
add the product not user the
administrator
now we will add some space in this one
foreign
we'll copy it from here then paste it
so here we will change it to the modify
the product
modify the product and
we have to adjust it as well
all right now again we'll add some space
so we can copy this one
now here we'll be right delete the
product
now here again
three and make this four
four will be off back to main menu
all right
now after that we will ask the user to
please enter your choice
so we'll display a message saying that
please enter your
choice
all right
now the user will enter the choice
now again we have to use the switch case
statements
inside this first case first of all
we'll make and inside this first case
we will call the add function
after that we'll use break statement
now we'll create case 2.
in case 2 we will call the modify
function or the edit function
so we'll write
edit
and again the break
now
we'll create case three
in case three
there would be delete function
so we'll name this function as remove
REM stands for remove
now ks4 would be back to main menu
so for that
we'll simply call the menu function
now after case 4 there would be default
case
so we'll write default
and we'll print a message saying that
invalid choice
all right so after the switch case
statement again as we have done in the
previous function we will mark
M with a go to statement which is a jump
statement and label it over here
all right so administrator function is
done
after this function now we will create
another function let's say buyer
function
so for that
word shopping
scope resolution operator
buyer
all right so inside this buyer function
first of all we'll declare the variables
and choice
now inside this function we'll ask the
user that he or she wants to buy the
product or go back so let's create that
first of all here we'll write
by the product now first of all we'll
write buyer
yeah
after that
no
first with me
login space let's copy it and paste it
over here and
all right selection
okay
go back
so the second option is go Mac
and we're going to the next one
space
[Music]
all right so these were some options
after that we will ask the user to enter
your choice
then the user will enter his choice
so we are taking the input
after that we'll use the switch
statement
and
choice
so inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create case one
inside this case we will call the
receipt function inside the receipt
function all the operations of the buyer
will take place
so this is the receipt function and
after that we'll use break
now we'll create case two
in case 2 will write
or call the menu function as
2 would be go back as we can see Now
default case
we'll write invalid choice
now after this again we'll use the go to
jump statement
and Mark here m
all right so after this function now we
will create the add function
so as we know if the user over here the
administrator over here will click on
this add the product that is the first
case then this add function will be
called so now we'll create this add
function
so we'll write void shopping
add
so inside this function we will use some
file handling operations
so create an object of app stream class
so data is the name of the object now
we'll create some variables like in C
and
token equals zero and
float p
float
d
and
string n
so these are the variables that we have
declared now we have to create a menu
kind of a structure in which we will ask
the user to enter the product code of
product the name of the product price
discount Etc
so let's do that
so let's write
add new
product
all right after that we will write the
product code of product will ask the
user to enter the product code of the
product
so we'll write slash and selection and
on slash d
will
take the input in P code we have already
declared these variables at the top of
our code now we will write another
message saying that name of the product
for that right name
of the product
now we'll take the input in P name
now we'll display
price of the product
we'll take the input and price
now we'll ask to enter the discount
so we'll write
discount of the discount on the product
all right so here we are asking the user
to enter the product code of the product
and the user will enter the product code
then the name of the product then he
will enter the name then the price and
then the discount
so after that now we will have to open a
file because as this add option is being
used by the administrator so we have to
store these product details inside a
particular file so that we can display
to the user that we have these products
in our supermarket
all right so for that
you'll have to use the file handling
operations data is the name of the
object as you can see and with the help
of data dot open
we can open the file
and
the name of the file we can write here
database
Dot txt
all right
after that
we want
to open this file in reading mode
iOS in will open the file in reading
mode and iOS out will open the file in
writing mode
so now
we will use if statement and we'll write
if not
data that is if this file
doesn't exist then
inside this function we'll write
data dot open
database Dot txt
we will open this basically we will open
this file in writing mode if this file
doesn't exist
and if this file exists then in else
block we'll do that
iOS out IOS app stands for append mode
and iOS trunk out stands for right mode
now
in order to write inside the file
will give some space and now we'll write
P code
this is how we can write inside a file
after that pname
then again some space
after that there is price
then again some space
after that
this for Discount
then we'll use slash n
all right so after that we have to close
the file as well
.close
data Dot close after that
in else block
that is if the fight exists then
we will read from the file so this is
how we can read from file
and
p
D these are the variables here we are
initializing the file because after that
we have to use the while loop to iterate
through the file
so let's do that
first of all I'll write this part and
then I'll explain
foreign
statement and if C equals to P code
then
token will be incremented
and
4
initialization
or for iteration
we'll again do that
so here what we are doing is first of
all we are initializing the index of
file here we are initializing the index
because after that we will use the while
loop inside this while loop we have
written
not data.eof this eof is the end of file
function this while loop will make sure
to check every content of the file by
iterating it so one by one each content
of the file is checked if the code
matches with the p code that is if there
is a duplicacy then the token variable
which we have
we can see initialize with 0 will be
incremented
it will become 1 basically after that
for the iteration purpose we are reading
from the file
and after that now
we will close the file data dot Clues
all right
now
we'll use if statement that if token is
1 As We Know
if token gets incremented that is if
there is a duplicacy
then again
it will go back to the menu that is if
the product code entered
by the administrator already exists then
he have to enter another product code
because if
the administrator enters the duplicate
code then it will again go back to this
menu
so this go to m
we have to label it over here
all right now in the else block
that is
if
the token value is not incremented that
is the product code entered by the
administrator is unique and Not
Duplicate then we can enter the product
the product that is its product code its
product name its price
so for that we can just copy paste this
part
it's the same
and
you can paste it over here
so here we are writing inside the file
so this is how we can write inside the
file and here we are opening the file in
append and writing mode
to write inside the file we have to open
the file in writing mode
so after that
we will display a message saying that
record inserted
this bracket error the else block will
close over here
all right
now this add function is done
we have done this part
now we have to create another function
named the edit function
as the add function is used for adding
the products in the market
based on their price
names discounts Etc now edit function
will edit the products like if you want
to edit some product like choose instead
of milk or something like that you can
do it with the help of edit function so
we'll do that functionality in edit
function so let's do that
we'll write void
shopping
edit the name of the function
so inside this function we will create
two objects
of f stream class that is data 1 and
data 2.
it is data and data one
all right so these two are the objects
of a stream class
now we will declare some variables
foreign
all right
now we'll write
a message displaying modified the record
so we'll write slation
now we will ask to enter the product
code
so we'll write
now we will open the file and check if
that file exists or not
yes
now if
that file doesn't exist
then
we'll simply display a message
saying that file doesn't exist
and in else block
we will open the file but not the same
file the other file this file would be
database one and we will open this file
with the help of this object that is
data one
so we'll write
data 1 dot open
the name of the file would be
database
1 Dot txt
and we will open this file
in append mode
and writing mode
so here what we are doing is we will
save our edited data in this file and we
will rename it to the original name that
is database.txt the name of this file is
database one dot txt we will save the
edited data in this file and then we
will rename this file as database.txt
that is the original name of the file
so now we will write data
P code
then P name
price
and then this
so we are initializing this file
basically we want to iterate this file
so
not data dot end of file
it will check each and every content of
the file
all right now
using if statement
we will check if P key equals to P code
P key is the code that is entered by the
administrator
which he wants to edit
so if that matches
then inside the file
right slash n
slash T slash t
and then product
of new code
product new code
here we are asking the administrator to
enter the new code for the product
so
CNC
he or she will enter the code then we
will ask
to enter the name
so let's slash and slash in
name of the
product
P name
and
now the price
so we'll write
foreign
now all the updated details of the
product will be entered with the help of
data one object
again some space
then
n
again some space
and here p
then here D
all right
now we'll write
a message saying that record edited
record edited all right
after that we'll increment the token
that is token plus plus
now this was the if block now in else
block
gain data 1
that is if
the product key would product code
entered by the administrator doesn't
matches with
any of the product code within the file
then
the hold variables that is
P code
B name
price
and after that discount
that is this
all right after that
yeah
we'll do that selection
now outside this else block we'll write
that
e-code P name
just for increment purpose
we want the while loop to iterate so
that is why we will use this one
so that this while loop can I trade
all right after this
we will close both the objects that is
data Dot close we are closing both the
files
and data one
Dot close
now as I already discussed that we have
to rename that database one back to the
original name that is database so we
will use two functions in C plus plus
that is remove function and rename
function with the help of remove
function we will remove the list that is
the database.txt file we will remove the
database.txt file and then with the help
of rename function we will rename
database1.ext to database.txt
so let's do that
remove inside remove we will write the
name of the file
it will basically remove all the list
inside the file
all right now rename function
inside the rename function first of all
we have to write the old name
that is database
1 Dot txt
then the new name
that is database
Dot txt
so now using this function
this name will be changed to
database.txt
all right
now if
token value is not incremented or we can
say is zero
then
it will display a message saying that
record
not
found
sorry
and with that we are done with the edit
function and now we will create remove
function
so we'll write
void
shopping
REM remove
this remove function will be bit similar
to that of the edit function so now
let's start with that
F stream we'll create two objects
data in data one
now
hint P key
and int token
he'll initialize it with zero
now
will display
slash d
delete
product
now we'll display
to enter the product code so we'll write
similar to previous function
and data dot open
database Dot txt
we are opening this file
in reading mode
and then we will check if this file
exists or not
so we'll write
so here we will write
if
not data
then inside will display
file doesn't exist
all right
now in else block
inside the else block we will open the
data one file
and the file name would be database 1
Dot txt
and we will open this file
in append and writing mode
all right now after that
a VSP code to initialize over iterate
the while loop we will write this
this is how we read from the file and
here we will use data because we will
iterate through data.us that is data
file
now inside the while loop
again we'll do the same as that we have
previously done
data Dot eof and file
now use if
P code equals to
P key
then
will simply display the message saying
that
product
deleted
successfully
all right and now we will increment the
token
now in the else block we will write
data one
space
then P code
then P named then price then discount
now we name
then
price
then discount
here the peaky entered by the
administrator will check for the first
product code if it matches the if block
executes
in the second iteration it will not
match an else block will execute and
database 1 file will be displayed
in other words in else block all the
products will be displayed except the
one which you want to remove or delete
so we will show this file database 1 and
then rename it with the previous one
that is database
alright so now let's go ahead
we'll do the same in order to iterate
this while loop
now
as you done previously
data Dot close as we have to close the
files
data one
Dot close
and after that again the remove function
to remove the database file
and rename function
firstly we will write the database one
that is the old name
make sure to put semicolons then
database
then database
dot txt the new name
all right after that if
tokens is not incremented
that is if token is zero then it will
simply display a message
saying that record cannot found
or record not found
so as we have created three major
functions now we will create another
function named list
it will help us in showing the list to
the customer or the buyer right shopping
now we'll write
list
inside this function
we'll write
the data the object of the Upstream
class
then data dot open
will open the database file
Dot txt
in the reading mode
all right after that
we will format it a bit
so after that again
you have to write the product number
name price Etc so we'll write
product number
and then we can use slash t
again name
then
price
and then we'll use slation
please put them inside the double quotes
and now again we'll copy this part
you can design it in your own way
and
now we can do
the Reading part data
P code
then the name as we have done previously
price
this
while loop inside the while loop again
we'll use
not data dot EOS
now inside this file
we'll write the product code product
name and the price we'll start with 2.
code
then product name
that is p name
after that
price
for the iteration purpose we'll write
again P code
P name
price
discount
all right now after that we will close
the file by writing data Dot
close
all right so we are done with this
function as well after this now we will
create the receipt function in which all
the customer operations will take place
so now let's create this receipt
function
so we'll write void shopping
our ecipdrecept
and now inside this function first of
all we'll create the object of app
stream class then we'll declare some
arrays because we have to store multiple
product keys and multiple quantities of
those products so that is why here we
have to use arrays and then we will
declare some variables
so let's start
first of all F stream class the object
of this class is data
now after this we'll create
array
array c means array of codes
so I'll declare it in that way
now after that
now we'll decline another array
array of q that is quantity
now
Choice variable
then there would be
a counter variable let's say
then discount variable
will initialize it with zero
and we'll initialize amount with 0 as
well
all right now
total variable
now we will display a message saying
that receipt
so that the user will know that this is
the receipt
foreign
a file that is data.open will open the
database.txt file and then we'll check
if that file or database exist or not
so
we have done this previously data dot
open
database
Dot txt
will open this file in reading mode
now we'll use
block and inside this if block will
write not data we are checking that if
this filo database exists or not
all right
if it doesn't exist if not data that is
if this file doesn't exist over this
database doesn't exist then we will
print the message saying that empty
database
empty with a p
now as this
now in else block we'll write if that
file exists
then first of all we'll close the file
that we already opened
now in else block we will call this list
function that we have created because if
the file is created then we have to call
the list function and we'll show the
user or the customer that these are the
products available in the supermarket
and for that we are calling this list
function
now we'll
design the structure and ask the user to
place the order
so let's do that
please place the order
now again we'll copy this part
all right so now we'll use do while loop
the purpose of using this do while group
is that we have to run a specific part
of the code every time and the other
part of the code we have to run based on
the choice
so now let's start with that
inside the do block first of all we will
ask the user to enter the product code
and enter the product quantity
so first of all
right
product code
enter product code
we'll take the input in the array
okay
now we'll ask the user
to enter
the quantity
all right now
we'll take the product quantity let us
see in
ARR Q
C
now
we will check that If the product code
entered by the user matches with the
product code that is being already
entered then we will display a message
saying that duplicate product code
please try again
so for that we have to use the for Loop
first of all and inside the for Loop
we'll initialize I with 0 I less than C
we have already initialized C with 0.
now I plus plus
so inside this
for Loop use if condition and check if
the product key or product code entered
by the user matches with the product
code that already exists in the file
then we will display a message saying
that duplicate product code so we'll
write
if
RAC of
C that is entered by the user equals
array of C
I
so I will keep on iterating as we have
used for Loop
so inside this if we will display a
message saying that
duplicate product code
please
try again
all right
now we'll write go to m again jump
statement as we have already discussed
now after this
we will increment C plus plus that is
If the product key is Not Duplicate then
C will increment that is the counter
will increment
all right now
we'll display a message saying that do
you want to buy another product or not
we'll write
all right so as we have displayed this
now we will take the input of the user
see in choice that whether he wants to
buy the product or not
so this is our do Loop now we'll have to
use after this do block we'll have to
use while loop as we are using a do
while loop now here is the condition
that if the user will press yes that is
why
then this Loop will execute
all right now
we'll make a design structure so we'll
write C out
and
slash and Slash and slash d slash T
slash t
and now we'll write receipt
all right now after that
now we'll write product number
Sorry by mistake we write
capital N now we'll write product number
then now we'll write
product quantity
product name sorry
now
product quantity
then the price
now we'll use the for Loop to iterate
through the file so we'll write
4 and I equals 0 I less than c i plus
plus
so now inside this for Loop first of all
because we have to do the iteration we
will open the file data dot open
database
double quotes database Dot txt
and we'll open this file in reading mode
so iOS
in
all right so after that
we will kind of initialize this file
we'll write P code
pname then price after that there was
discount
all right now as we have done previously
while not
data dot eof that is end of file
and inside this while loop we will check
we are actually matching if the code
entered by the user that is
arrci is equal to the code present in
the file and if so then we will do the
calculations and add those file in the
customer basket
so let's do that P code equals array of
C of I
here we are checking
if so then
we'll do the amount amount equals to
price of the product into the quantity
of the product
all right after that we'll have to do
the discount part
so in this part we know that the
discount is calculated by multiplying
amount with discount divided by 100
and then we have to subtract it from the
amount
so let's do that amount minus
amount
into
discount
divided by 100.
all right now after that as we are done
now we'll have to add discount to the
total variable
because in this part the total amount
after getting discount is stored in this
disk variable now we'll add this
variable to the total variable
all right so as this is done now we will
print this part
so in this part we are just printing so
we'll
do the slash in and now then P code
then pname
then array of q05
array of Q
I
all right now after that price
and then amount
and amount after discount or we'll write
discount only
because we have to write the variable
all right now we'll have to add the
slash keys in between them
so let's do that part
all right so we have added the slash T's
in between them for the formatting
purpose now to iterate the file for the
iterating purpose we'll do the same that
P code
P name
price
discount
all right now after this while loop
now we will have to close the data file
so we'll write data dot Clues
so after this data Dot close we have to
print the total amount so let's do that
first of all we will do some
designing part like let's say selection
selection
now
just for design purpose
now we'll simply print the total
variable
we'll write first of all total amount
now the variable
total
all right so everything is done except
the main function now in the main
function
we'll write
so int main now inside this main
function as we know we have created the
class shopping class so we will create
the object of that shopping class and we
will call
the menu function with the help of that
object as we know that is the first
function that must be called so we'll
write shopping
and let's say the object of this is s
and s dot
menu function
so as we know the menu function is the
topmost function
so this menu will display when we run
the file
so now everything is done
and now let's run this file
let's press compile and run
I hope it works
there are some errors
all right so 335 okay
so this is the error and now
57 line
number 57
yeah we have to use double equal to
and one more error is there I think
now let's try to run this
there might be some more errors
as you can
all right after this 386
okay so we haven't labeled this one
we have to label m
now let's try to run this
so here we can see Supermarket main menu
first is administrator then second if
you're a buyer three to exit
so first we'll log in as an
administrator
so as you can see please log in
so now we'll enter the admins email
so we'll write
Robbie at the rate
email
.com
now the password
one two three
now this is the administrator menu as
you can see first is the add product if
you want to add the product second to
modify the product three to delete the
product and four to back to main menu
so now I'll click on
like I want to add the product so I'll
write one I'll press one and enter add
new product so now I have to add product
code of the product
like let's say the product code of
product is one
name of group product let's say juice
and price is 70.
and discount on product is
two percent record inserted
now again I want to add so I'll click on
one product code of product would be two
now name of product would be let's say
bread
price 30
discount again to
record inserted now again
product now would be let's say butter
three
inverter
price of product would be 60.
discount would be four
now fourth product
sorry add product Now product could be
fourth
and this would be
let's say X
price would be 170
discount three percent
record inserted so now we will check
that these records are inserted or not
so we can cross check it by
going here and open this database file
so as we can see one juice
product code one is Juice price is
seventy two is the discount then second
is bread third is butter 4 is egg so
first this is the product code this is
the price and this is the discount on
that product
now let's come back and modify the
product
let's say first product was juice
and we want to modify that product
so what we'll do is We'll add the
product code one and the new product
code would be one only let's say we
don't want to change that and name of
the product would be
chips we'll replace it with chips
price would be
20
and discount would be 2 percent
so record edited as we can see here
record edited and now we can check
so now we'll open this database file so
as you can see
as you can see one Chips
two bread three butter four eggs so the
first product that was used is replaced
by chips
so this function is done now let's try
the delete function
we'll click on 3 for delete
and now we have to enter the product
code of the product which we want to
delete so let's say we want to delete
the fourth product
and we can see product deleted
successfully we can check that
as you can see
there are three products left the fourth
one got deleted
so now let's go back and let's check if
the customer wants to buy the product
how can he or she buy so let's first of
all we click on phone to go back to the
so now let's click onto as a buyer to
buy some products now we'll click on one
to buy the product
so as you can see our products are chips
bread and butter
so product numbers are one two three and
their price are 20 30 60 respectively
and now we'll enter the product code of
the product which we want to buy so I'll
click on one
and the quantity I say to
want to buy another product or not they
are asking if you want to buy another
product if yes then press Y and if no
then press n
so we'll click on why because we want to
buy another product so now I'll click on
2 that is bread
product quantity I'll add product
quantity as four breads
and now butter so for that first of all
why for butter I will click on three
product code of butter is three now
quantity would be two
now I don't want to buy any other
products so I'll click on n
so as you can see
product numbers product name their
quantity price amount and amount with
discount
and the total is there that is 272
and if we wish to buy another product so
we can click on one else we can click on
two to go back
so this is our receipt our total amount
is there
so this is our complete project on
Supermarket billing in C plus plus you
can try it although the code is bit long
approx 400 to 450 lines of code
but it is worth trying this project will
allow a user to book a flight to a
particular country and he or she will
receive the ticket by filling in all the
important details
different concepts of C plus plus will
be used in making this project which
will help you in understanding the
concepts of C plus plus in a practical
manner
so now let's go ahead
so now let's go to our code editor that
is Dev C plus plus
so this is our code editor now let's
create a new file
and let's start with it
so let's add some header files hash
include
iostream
now we will add another header file that
is f stream for file handling operations
now hash include
i o manip
so this header file is used for floating
Point values
so now we'll add the standard namespace
now we'll write the main function
now inside this main function we will
create an object of a class
our class name is management
and
the object name would be m-o-b-j
after that returns 0
now we have to create this class
so we'll write
class
management
and inside this class we will make a
Constructor because we have created the
object of this class so Constructor
would be called and inside that
Constructor we will call the function
so let's do that first of all we'll
write the public scope
now under this public scope we'll write
management
so this is our Constructor management
and inside this Constructor we will call
a function let's say the name of the
function is main menu
all right so now the class ends so we'll
write the semicolon in the end
now inside this function
main menu we have to create a menu that
will display on the screen
and also we have to use this function
many times inside this program so we
have to declare this function globally
so we'll write
void
mean menu
so this is the function prototype
now after that
we can create this function
so let's write void mean menu
and now we'll declare some variables L
choice
int s choice
and another variable let's say back
now we have to create a layout or a
structure for a menu so let's do that
slash t
ail Airlines
you can write any name as of your choice
now we will write main menu we'll write
slash t
foreign
now again we'll add some space for some
lines
let's add slash t
foreign
now we'll create a structure in which
we'll ask the user to press a particular
button to open a particular
functionality like press one to open the
customer details press 2 for flight
registration press C for ticket and
charges
so let's do that
foreign
copy paste
I'll copy this part and paste it over
here
and second one we'll write press 2
for flight registration
foreign
so we are done with the layout now we'll
take the input from the user
so let's do that
foreign
Choice the variable that we have
declared
now for all three of them we'll make a
separate classes that is what customer
details will make a detailed class for
flight registration will make a
registration class for ticket and
charges will make a ticket class
and to to call the functions of these
classes will have to make the object of
these classes so let's do that
so we'll write
details
d d is the object name
registration
r r is the object name
ticket is the class name t is the object
name so we have created these objects D
R and T
now we'll use a switch statement a
switch case statement
and now we'll write
L choice
now inside the switch case first of all
we'll create a case one
now inside this case we'll have to call
a function of detailed class
so let's do that but before that we'll
write
C out
customers
so that it looks nice now we'll call the
function let's say the name of the
function is information
and now
we'll ask the user
to press one to go back to the main menu
like if the user wants to go back to the
main menu
after filling the details or something
like that then he or she can click on
this one button
all right now we'll take the input
back this is the variable that we have
declared now
if
back equals one
then
we'll call the main menu function
that is the main menu will display
and also in else block we'll do the same
we'll call this function only
and here we'll write
press any
key to go back to main menu
now
here we'll do the break
case one ends
now we have to create a case too
case two is for flight registration so
we'll simply
display a message and call the function
we'll write
book a flight
using this system
all right after that we'll use slash n
foreign
all right now we'll call this function r
dot flights R is the name of the object
and flights is the name of the function
that we will create afterwards
now we'll write break
now we'll have to create case three
no case raise for Ticket collection now
all we need to do is to display a
message saying that get your ticket
all right now we'll use slash n
ope now we'll call the function
T is the object name Bill is the name of
the function let's say
now
will display a message saying that your
ticket is printed
you can get it
or you can collect it
foreign
press 1 to display your ticket
we'll take the input and
if back equals to 1
then inside if condition
will call this function display
T is the object name displays a function
now after that we'll display a message
press 1 to go back to main menu
or press any key to go back to main menu
so we'll write
press
Enter key to go
back
to main menu
all right now after that we'll take the
input of this
and if back equals to
1
then we'll write
main menu that is recall this menu
function
foreign
else
we're going
again we will call this menu function
to display the menu
right after this
break to end the case
closing bracket and now here is the
starting bracket
all right so now we have to create a
case for
inside case 4 first of all we'll display
a message saying that see out thank you
because in case 4 as we can see
press 4 to exit so
if a user press 4 will display a message
saying that
legislation installation and then again
a slash d
now thank you message will be displayed
after that and I'll
now we'll write break
and after that
there would be a default case
now in this default case a message would
be displayed like
invalid input or something like that
right
invalid input
please try again
right after that we'll use slash n and
handle
now
to go back to main menu so that the user
can try once again so we'll call this
function main menu
now after that
break
now we have to create classes like first
of all we have to create this
detail class in which we are calling the
information function
so this is the information function and
now let's create its class that is class
detail
so let's do it
class
details
now in the public scope
you will declare some variables and
static
string
name
and let's say gender
both of these would be string
and
now after that let's create the variable
phone number
and
gender
not gender age we have already created
gender now age could be integer then
there is
address we'll write add
then there is another variable
static end
customer ID so let's see ID
now
an array we have to create
let's give it 100
now let's create this function
information
so inside this information function
first of all we'll ask the user to enter
the customer ID
so
slash n
enter the customer
ID
after that
now the user will enter the customer ID
CID
as you can see
now
will ask the user
to enter the name
foreign
then we'll ask the user to enter the
edge
then there is address
foreign
gender
now once the user has entered all these
details then we'll display a message
saying that your details are saved with
us
I will write your details
are saved
this
[Music]
all right so we have to end the class
over here so we'll use semicolon
now we'll create another class
now we will create the registration
class but before that we have to use
some of the variables of the detailed
class in the ticket class
so for that
we'll write in detail
scope resolution operator
C ID
this is the variable that we want to use
then the name variable write string
name
then that variable gender so write
string
all right so now we can create this
class so let's do this right class
registration
and now inside this class first of all
we'll declare some variables under the
public scope we'll write in declare a
static variable choice
foreign
let's say then
another variable back
then
a static float variable
named charges
all right so these are the variables now
we have to create the function flights
that we have called from the mean menu
function
so this is the flight function now
inside this flight function
there is a character array
named flight and
now after that
inside this array we'll put the name of
the countries as the elements so let's
start
first of all is Dubai
after that there is
Canada
then let's say another one is
UK
then there is
USA
after that there would be Australia
then let's say Europe
all right now
using a for Loop
we will display each of these countries
one by one
so we'll write int a equals 0
a less than
six
a plus plus
now inside this for Loop
we'll write
a plus 1
.
Dot
flight
to
so here what we are doing is this a plus
1 that is 0 plus 1 so Dubai will be
displayed then one by one Canada UK US
Australia all of these
will get displayed and now after that
we'll write
flight n
kernel
now
all these countries will be displayed to
the user so now the user have to select
a country so first of all we'll write
welcome
to the
Airlines
then
handle after that
will ask the user to press the number of
the country or which you want to book
the flight
so we'll write
press the number
so we'll take the input from the user
see in choice
now after that we'll use switch
statements we'll write
switch
inside we'll write choice
and now I will make some cases
case one will be of Dubai case tool we
have Canada then UK US Australian then
Euro so let's start with Dubai
so we'll display a message
we'll write welcome to Dubai merits
thank you
all right now selection
now again we'll display a message saying
that
your comfort
is our priority
enjoy the journey
now we'll display following are the
flights
following are
the flights
all right so
now
we'll display first flight so we'll
write
this is the name of the flight and now
and L and now we have to display also
that the timing and the date of the
flight and how many hours will it take
and the price
so let's do that
so here we'll write
slash d
then we'll write
the date
after that the timing
there is 10 hours flight
rupees 14 000 let's say
similarly
let's copy and paste let's say there are
three flights
that are going to Dubai
and
let's change the model numbers
658
and the time and the date also
all right so these are the flights now
we will ask the user to select the
flight
right
select the flight you want to book
[Music]
see in Choice One
now if the user chooses one
then we have to create the condition
you can use the switch case or you can
do if else as well
so let's start if Choice One
equals equals one
that is if the user or the customer
chooses the first flight flight then
charges will assign the flight charges
like 14 000
and
display message
saying that you have successfully booked
the flight
okay
[Music]
you can go back to menu and take the
ticket
will display this message
so this is our if statement
now we have to create else if statement
as well
for the condition we'll write if Choice
1
equals equals to
then what we'll do is
let's just copy and paste to save time
you can copy this part and paste it over
here
charges as we know the charges of this
slide is ten thousand
it will write 10 000.
and its number was
658
all right similarly
for the third flight as well we'll do
the same
the charges was nine thousand
so let's do that
the number was 498
we have to change this one
let's say 508
so that the flight numbers are unique
now in else block
we'll write
invalid input shifting to the previous
menu so we'll simply display that
foreign
function
after that
if the user wants to go back to the main
menu so we'll display a message for that
press any key to go back to the main
menu
[Music]
thank you
if the user chooses one that is if back
equals equals one
then the main menu function would be
called
and same otherwise
similarly we'll create case two
so let's do that
in case two we'll just copy and paste
this one to save some time
all right the changes we have to do is
welcome to Canadian
Airlines
and now your comfort is a priority
it's all right following other flights
so
the model number and number of flights
we have to change let's say
and the timings like
and the dates and time
it's
2 pm
you can change that as per your choice
you can do whatsoever you want
20 hours
foreign
book
then similarly in the first flight was
of 34 000
ca198
and if you choose two then there would
be 29 000
forty thousand
the rest is all good shifting to the
previous menu as we have done previously
and now again
after this else
we can create case three
so inside this case three we'll write
welcome to
UK Airways so we'll write
so now let's say to UK there are only
two flights
let's say there are only one flight
to UK I'll write
UK
and its flight number is 798 let's say
and the timings are
and date is first of all 12. and the
timing is 10 am
it will take around 14 hours
14 hours
and 44 000. rupees select the flight you
want to book this is same and here I
have to change 44 000.
all right so to UK there is only one
flight so we not need to create these
Health statements so we can just cut it
and in else block the rest is same
so now after that we have to create case
three
sorry Case 4
and we can copy and paste this one as
well so our fourth flight was of us that
is U.S Air Base
all right now we will change the name
right
us 567
and the dates
it's a choice
because I need 39 000 here and
there is 42 000.
after this
now case 5 would be of Australian
Airlines so we'll write case five
and copy paste this part
and he will write
Australian
Airlines
foreign
so let's change we'll write
yes
and
698 timing date would be
18
9
44
000.
foreign
[Music]
everything is done in this part
now we'll create case six
in case six
all we need to change is
welcome to Dubai my rates and we'll
change it to European airlines
European airlines then will change its
name to
EU
498 instead of 498.98
and the date let's say to
time is 2 am
18 hours of flight and its price is 36
000.
31
000
.
10 AM and
all right now we have to change its
model number as well
all right so EU
898
and its price is 36 000.
its price is 37 000.
all right rest everything is done in
this part
now let's create the default case
all right
in the default case we will write
invalid input
please
no shifting to the main menu
foreign
menu function
now we'll write break
and close the switch statements
all right so uh this registration
function is done
it's pretty long as we have created six
cases
of all the countries named
Dubai Canada UK US Australia Europe
now only one function is or class is
left that is ticket class
so let's create this ticket class
all right so now after this registration
class we'll have to use the semicolon
so now before this ticket class we need
to know that we have to use some
variables of registration class and the
details class in this ticket class so we
will do the multiple inheritance and
before that let's do the same thing as
we did earlier
float registration because we have to
use these variables so we'll write
the class name then scope resolution
operator
charges
is the variable then another variable
would be
choice
both of these variables is of
registration class so that is why we are
doing this
all right now we will start with the
class ticket
we'll write class
ticket then we have to inherit both of
these classes that is we have to use
multiple inheritance right public
registration
and then details
so here we are using the multiple
inheritance because we have to use the
variables of both of these classes in
this class ticket
now in the public scope
we'll start with the function that is
Bill
void bill
and now inside this function first of
all we'll declare a variable name
destination
and will left it like this because
we have to assign it
a choice that is being made by the
person who wants to travel to the
country
so now off stream as we know is used to
create or write information in the files
the object of is off stream is out f
we have created now
let's say the file is records.txt you
can name it as per your choice
in which the data
of the flights is being stored
now we'll write inside this records.txt
file
so as We Know
to right inside the file the object name
and
then whatsoever we want to show inside
the file
XYZ Airlines
okay
thanks
details that is class name
scope resolution operator CID
then handle
similarly we'll do that for name and
gender as well
foreign
people
now
when it comes to destination as we have
left the empty space now the user if the
user will press one then it will go to
Dubai if if two then Canada 3 then UK 4
then USA so we'll have to do that as
well so we'll write if
registration as the class was
registration
scope resolution operator Choice equals
equals one
then destination variable equals
Dubai
and
let's copy this part because we have to
use else if statements as well you can
just copy and paste all we need to do is
else if
now we can change it to choice 2.
and name to Canada
now after that we'll simply print or
write the destination
so first of all we'll write destination
and then we'll print the variable
let's do slash D to add some horizontal
space
now
destination variable
all right now
foreign
the flight cost
because it is a variable of registration
class
all right now
we have to close this
object or file outf Dot
close
we have closed the file
now
we have to display the receipt as well
so for that we have to create another
function within this class only we'll
create void disk build that is display
bin
so inside this function
we will create an if stream class and
its variable let's say will be ifs we
all know it if stream class is used to
read from the file so we are actually
reading here so
we'll write records.txt file
now we'll use the if condition
inside this so we'll write if
not ifs that if it doesn't exist
then it should show an error that is
let's say
file error
foreign
Loop and we'll check not ifs dot end of
file that is here we are checking the
file till the end that is every content
of the file will check and ifs dot get
line
array
100
here we have used get line to read the
content from the file and while loop
will help us in doing that after that
we'll print
array and then enter
all right after that we have to close
this file as well
so we'll do that ifs Dot close
now we have to close the class as well
semicolon
so yeah our code is pretty much done
after this
there was main menu and
the main function
so now let's try to run this one
before that let's save it
and let's name it as
flight dot CPP
all right now let's try to run this
there are a few errors
all right so
first error is
this one and
let's check them all
flight dot CPP
66 line 66 there's an error
all right function name is wrong flight
we missed the T then line 466
foreign
[Music]
526
this one is associated with the previous
one error that is information error
let's go to 561
T dot display
all right so we wrote the wrong name it
was disp Bill
all right now let's try to run this
again
semicolon we forgot
now
as you can see XYZ Airlines main menu
press 1 to add the customer details
there's a little bit formatting error
you can figure it out yourself
press 1 to add customer details press 2
for flight registration 3 for ticket and
charges and four to exit so let's say a
new customer I am so I'll press one and
I'll write customer ID
1.
now the name of the customer let's say
Raj
of the customer is 23
and address is
Chandigarh
all right
now gender is male
foreign
all right now press any key to go back
to the main menu we can press any key
two three one
then this is the main menu again
now I want to register a flight I'll
press 2.
so these are the flights fly to Dubai
Canada UK USA we forgot to add some
space we must add some space over here
so these are the flights to Dubai Canada
UK US Australia Europe and welcome to
Airlines they are asking us to press the
number of the country of which you want
to book the flight let's say I want to
go to USA
so
4
so these are the flights us 567 us-658
us 508
and these are the timings and these are
the dates let's say I want to go to
658 us 658 then I'll press 2.
so there's a mistake by us we forgot to
change the name of this flight we'll
change this later and now let's go back
to the main menu
now let's say we know that we have
booked this year 658 but there was some
writing error we by mistake forgo to
write us 658 over here instead we write
tub
e now as we know that we have this
flight that is booked so we want to go
for ticket and charges so we'll click on
three
your tickets ticket is printed you can
collect it
all right plus one
to display your ticket
as you can see
customer ID 1 customer name Raj mail
description destination USA flight
course 39 000 as we know this is the 39
000 flight
so this is how
you can build this project and now let's
correct a mistake
let's go to
Australia US flight sorry so here it is
let's change it to
U.S
and now let's save it
so now it will work fine
so this was a project on Airline
reservation system
you can also try this project on your
own
in this video session we will be
creating a c plus project
this project will be a security system
in C plus plus
here we will create a system in which we
can register login and if we wish to
change the password then also we can do
that
we will try to keep things easy and
basic so that each and every one of you
can understand the security system in C
plus project before moving forward let
me ask you a quick question
what was the previous name of C plus
plus option A C option b c with classes
option C C plus or option D C with
objects
please leave your answers in the comment
section below and stay tuned to find the
correct answer
now let's switch to our code editor
which is Dev C plus plus
so this is our code editor now let's
save this file first of all
let's name this file as
system
dot CPP
all right so we have named this file now
we'll start with header files so first
of all we'll add the header files so
we'll write
hash include
IO stream for input output operations
all right now we'll add another header
file which is
hash include fstring
now
the third header file which we will be
adding that would be S string
so this app stream Library the f-stream
library is used because we have to work
on files and this Library allows us to
do so it is used for file handling
operations
now the second one that is the sstream
library this header file provides
templates and types that enable
interoperation between string buffers
and string object
so this was it now we will have to add
another header file
all right and let's do that
hash include
string all right
so iostream app stream as stream and
string we have added the added files Now
using namespace STD
all right now we will create the main
function that is int Main
now inside the main first of all we will
be creating variables so let's do that
int a let's say now we'll initialize I
with 0
now we will be creating some strings
let's say
string text all these variables we will
be using it later in the project so
let's create them
password let's say password one
password to
let's name it pass
name
password 0
age
user
word and
word one
so we will be using these variables
later in our project
all right now
let's create some string array
so
creds that is credentials
will make an array
all right CP
2.
all right
now we'll display
an interface and in that interface we
will show uh four options like register
login change password and end program
so let's just do that
all right
so let's name it security system
handle
so as we are creating a interface so
let's make it look good like
we can do some things like that
and then for extra space now
here we can do one thing like
you can do like this
it's up to you how you want to beautify
your interface that's all upon you
so I'm basically doing that
register
foreign
ly we will do
for others
like we can just copy paste it will save
our time
so basically
first would be register
second would be login
and third would be change password and
fourth would be n program
and we can do one more thing
all right now let's make it two
this would be login
3 would be change password
foreign
would be
end program
all right so register login change
password and end program
so we have created four of these
so we have created the four choices now
after this we will be asking the user to
enter any choice like if you want to
register login or change password or end
the program so he can select one two
three or four for that we have to take
an input from the user
so we will do that first of all to add
some space we can do handle
all right
yeah
so now we will use a do while loop so
inside the do
we will again use handle twice so that
there would be some difference between
this register login interface and the
choice that we will be asking
all right now C out
enter
your choice
so here we are asking the user to enter
one two three or four
as per his or her choice
all right
all right
so C in
here we will be taking the input let's
say a is the input
now we'll use a switch case
right switch and inside the choice that
the user will enter
all right now
case one would be there first of all
case one
and inside case one let's scroll it a
bit all right so inside case one
first of all we will be printing
something like register as as the user
has pressed one so he want to register
first of all so we'll create an
interface over here as well
so let's do that okay see out
like we previously did it's your choice
like how you want to do it
right now we can
write
foreign
all right
after that again
let's leave some space here
or we can do it above as well like
here also we can do this
and let's do this here
foreign
so register here we have created
now we'll use two Vandal because we want
to create some Gap in between enter your
choice and this interface so right
so we will print a message enter your
username it's like please
enter
username
all right so after that the user will
enter the username
so we'll take the input of that
so here we will write name
all right now the user
will have to enter password also so
right please
enter the
password
so after this the user will enter the
password so we will be taking the input
of that
so
we have already created these variables
as you can see name we have created and
password 0 also we have created so we'll
use that password 0.
all right now we'll ask the user to
enter his or her age
so like please
enter
your age and whatever credentials you
want them to enter you can do that you
can also take the input of the address
or something personal that you want to
store you can also do that
so all right
so please enter your age
see in
huge all right this name password 0 and
age we have already created these
variables we have initialized these
variables all right now
now we will store these details that is
now name password 0 and age
into some file and for that we have to
use the file handling operations
so we'll use those like we will create
off stream class we'll create an object
of offstream of one
and
to F1
so we will use of1 as it is the object
of offstream class
and why we have used the offstream class
because it is used to open a file to
write something in it so here we want to
store name password H in that file so
basically we have to use off stream only
and if stream class is used when we want
to open a file for reading purpose but
now we want to open the file for writing
purpose so that because of that we have
used offstream Class
so here we will write of1 that is the
object of Upstream class dot open
so
inside this we will write the name like
that file dot txt it will open the file
all right
now inside the if block we'll write o f
1
dot is
open
underscore open this is a function
all right
whoever this is open it will keep on
moving till
all the details will be entered in the
file so we'll write of1
so here basically we are writing the
details inside the file
we'll use slashing because we want the
username and password in different lines
so that is why we have used slash n here
all right of one
password
all right password zero it was sorry
no
we have stored the name and password
only
now we'll write
registration
successful
all right registration successful
now as we can see break statement we
have already written
all right
so basically everything is done in this
case here we have taken the input of
username password age and stored all
these details in the file
so that we can use it later
now this was the case one registration
is done in case one now we can move on
to case two
similarly we will create a case too
now inside this case two
all right now inside this case two first
of all we will initialize I with 0 why
we are doing this I'll explain that
later
so similarly we will create
the interface that we previously created
in registration so let's do that
foreign
so we have created this
now here we will use if stream because
we want to read
so as I previously told that if steam is
used to read from files open and read
from files so we will create if stream
class and object if stream
if one or let's say of of2
so this is the object of if stream class
Now using this object we will open the
file of2 dot open
now of
sorry here we will write file Dot txt
all right so here we have opened this
file and now
we'll take the input like we'll have to
match it whether it is the same personal
node so we'll take the input we'll write
please
enter the username
see in
user the other variable that we have
created
now see out
please enter the password
all right so
here also we'll take the input from the
user we'll write the other variable that
is pass that's why we have created so
many variables
all right now
let's roll it a bit
now if similarly that we have done
previously of2 dot is underscore open
so it will check all the files basically
is open then
here we will use a while loop
dot o f
2
dot end of file so here we are using the
end file function
from this eof or end of file function we
can detect when the Endo file is reached
it returns non-zero when the end of file
has been reached otherwise it will
return 0.
all right inside it now we will create
another while loop
while
get line
of2 that is the object
and text that is a variable
all right
now inside it we will write
I String
string
ISS
text
all right now I'll explain the part
so here in this part get line part so a
while loop together with the get line
function is used here to read the file
line by line
so using this the getline function the
file will be red line by line and this I
String stream object
so I String stream object is used to
stream the string and store it using the
extraction operator
after this we will be using an
extraction operator where we will store
the string
all right
here we have used the extraction
operator and here we are storing
now in the grids array that we have
created
we will be using
yeah here we were
all right so in credits array
we have already declared this
we will store the word first of all
and then we will increment because one
by one
the in the zeroth position first of all
first username will be stored then
the password will be stored in the
second position so we need to increment
that
all right
now
we will match if the
registered username matches with this
username or not and similarly we will do
for password so we can do like if user
equals to creds at zeroth position that
is the username username the user has
entered first so it must be at the
zeroth position
and the password would be at the first
position
and index one so for that we can use if
password equals to
grid set
index one
then
we can print a message
saying that login
successful
all right
now to add some space we can use handle
now after displaying this login
successful sign we can print the details
like
we can write
details
we can write C out
username
name
handle
all right similarly for the password
will do
foreign
so here we will show the username
password age details to the user
now in the else block so where the
password and login credential will not
match in that case now we'll do
so for that case we will write first of
all let's create some distance
so that it looks nice
all right so first of all we will write
incorrect credentials
all right incorrect credentials
after that we can do one more thing
so
we will write
press
two
let me just do this press 2
to login
press 2 to login
and
here similarly we'll write
change password
so
press three
to change
password
so here we go
so if the details are incorrect so the
user can log in again try or
he or she can try to change the password
now we'll add the break statement also
so here we have added the break
statement now
as you can see our case 3 is also done
so what we have done in case three is
like
we have taken the input of username and
password and then we tried to store it
at credentials that is an array
so at credentials zeroth position that
is index 0 the username will be stored
and at credential first index the
password will be stored then we will try
to match the username that the user has
entered while registering with the creds
at zeroth position and password with the
password
so if it matches the login will be
successful and the details will be shown
and if it will not it if the details are
not matched then it will show an error
in correct credentials and press 2 to
login and press C to change password
so this was the case too
now let's move on to case 3.
from here we will create the case three
foreign
again we will first of all initialize I
with 0
now here let's scroll it a bit
yeah so here we can write like
change password so
let's do this
change
password
so
now after displaying this again we will
open the file using that if stream here
if stream
of0
Now using this object 4 F 0 will open
the file.txt
file Dot txt
all right so here we will write
file Dot txt
after opening this file we will display
a message to enter the old password so
because we are changing the password so
first of all we'll ask them to enter the
old password
so
enter the
old password
now we'll take the input pulled this is
the variable
now we'll use an if condition
that similar to that that we have
previously used os0 dot is open
this file will remain open
now again we'll use end of operation
function
is underscore
end of file
all right now inside this while loop
again second while loop will be used
similarly that we have done previously
get line function again
all right
I String stream
ISS
text
ISS
word one here basically we are storing
the data in word one
then CP another array
so we'll store word one at the zeroth
position
then we'll increment
CP by mistake we wrote Co
all right
now we'll increment so that the password
will also get stored
all right
now
we'll use if condition
if if old password is equal to cp1 as we
know at cp0
the username is there but we have to
compare the password so if old password
is equal to cp1 that is the new password
that the user has entered then
first of all we'll close the previous
file
to free up the memory space
all right now we will open another file
with off stream object of one
because off stream is used when we want
to write something
open and write so now we'll use
of one object
dot is underscore open
now
double actually
all right now C out
enter your new password we are basically
asking them to enter the new password
we will take the input of the password
one
then we again display another message
saying that enter your password again
so enter your password
again
again we'll take the input
saying that password to
now if
password 1
equals to
password to
then
we will overwrite
CP
0
that is we are storing the zeroth index
of CP at of1 we will basically
overwriting this slash and so that the
username and the password
displays in different lines in the file
that is being created
of one
password one here we are basically
overwriting now will display the message
after this that password
changed successfully
all right
now in else block that is if password
one is not equal to password 2 in that
case what we will be doing is of1
CP 0 after CP 0
will again use slash n
all right of one
old that is the
old password
so it doesn't get override here
so now we'll display
password
do not
match
now for the previous if
we'll create else condition
in this else we will print
please enter valid password
that is if the old password entered by
the user is wrong please enter a valid
password
all right once this is done we can use a
break here
all right
now the break statement is already there
now
as we can see there were four
things like four options login change
password and end program fourth one is
end program now we'll have to create
case number four
and inside that case we can do one thing
like we'll
just print one thing and use the break
statement we can write like thank you
a little look nice
all right so the fourth case is also
done
now we can also create a default case
in the default case we can write like
enter a valid Choice like if the user by
chance entered five six seven other than
one two three four then this message
will be displayed
all right now we'll use a while loop
not equals to 4.
so
so this is the while loop of this dude
that we have created as we can see this
do we have used the do while loop so it
keeps on repeating until a that is the
choice is not equal to 4 Once the user
entered 4 that is the end program
then it will not show the options so
that's why we have used
a this while
return
0.
all right our code is done let's try
to run this program
I believe some errors must be there
let's see
so
it is showing some error over here
so we have used
level codes with endl which we can't use
all right now let's save this one
and now let's try to run this
before got to close this one there must
be some errors
again so again we'll have to
make it double equal to
and one more energy is there I figured
that out a not equal to 4. forgot to add
equal to sign
now I'm sure that
I'm pretty sure that all the errors are
resolved let's try to run this again
all right as you can see
one for register two for login three for
change password four four and program
all right so
first of all we will register let's say
we want to register enter your choice
one
let's say AK
one at the red Gmail
so this is the username
let's set the password AK
123
right age 24
registration successful now we have to
press 2 to login
again the username we will have to enter
we will write AK
1 at the rate Gmail
now the password is
ak123 As We Know
so as you can see the details are here
username is this password is this and
age is 24.
now let's say we want to change the
password
we'll click on 3 as it is measured to
change the password you'll have to click
on three
so we have clicked on three
so first we'll have to enter the old
password which was ak12
3.
now the new password
ak321 let's say
for the confirmation we will have to
enter the password again ak321
as you can see password change
successfully now just to check that
if this password is really changed or
not we'll log in again
we'll press 2 to login and enter the
username ak1
at the rate Gmail and try to log in with
the new password which is ak321
as we can see the login is successful
username is this password is ak3221
three to one age is 24.
now let's say
if we try to login with the wrong
password
so let's say AK one at the rate Gmail
this was our username
now the password let's say
ak456 let's try to login with the wrong
password
as you can see incorrect credentials
press 2 to login press 3 to change the
password
so now it's your choice if you want to
login again
then you can do that if you want to
change the password you have to click on
three
and as we know that
we know the right password so will not
do that
password change thing
all right now
we'll click on four to
end program as you can see thank you
message is displayed
now we can also try one more thing like
let's try to run this again
as you can see uh first of all let's
register
let's see
Sam
at the rate Gmail
this is the username the password is
sam123
and the age is 24.
so as you can see the registration is
successful
now we'll try to login
so while logging in we'll put the wrong
password
so let's see
Sam
at the rate
Gmail
Sam
three to one
so as you can see incorrect credentials
again press 2 to login and press C to
change password
so you can click on two or three if you
want to
if you want to login or change password
respectively
I don't want to do that so I'll simply
click on four
to end the program so thank you message
will be displayed
so guys this was about this
security system in C plus plus it is
quite basic topic and all the concepts
that are being used is intermediate
level you can create this on your own
you can add some functionality some more
functionality to this security system
also and uh doing projects like this
will enhance your knowledge in C plus
plus and will give you
or show you the Practical aspect of C
plus plus
you can try this project on your own so
previously a question was asked about
what C plus plus previous name was
the correct option was C with glasses
earlier C plus plus was also known as C
with classes

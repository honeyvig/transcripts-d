- [Narrator] It's lunchtime and
this is Brad Anderson's lunch break.
(playful music)
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus,
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Whenever I can, I try to take advantage
of both of these things and I grab lunch
with some of the tech
industry's best and brightest.
(playful music)
Today I'm talking with Mauricio Guerra,
the Chief Information Security
Officer at Dow Chemical.
(playful music)
(greets in foreign language)
- Hola, Brad. Nice to meet you.
(speaks in foreign language)
- [Brad] Dow Chemical,
one of the biggest chemical
companies in the world,
you make plastic, you purify water,
you're in agriculture, fifty
four thousand employees,
one hundred and twenty year old company,
and you've got to keep
it all secure and safe.
So if someone is watching this and
they've got a set of executives that
really, you know, have
some misunderstandings
or just don't have the awareness of
cyber security and cyber threats,
what advice would you give them
in, you know, an IT professional,
in educating their managers or leaders?
- The most effective way, but of course
is the way that we don't want,
is learning the hard way.
- Yeah.
- Is learning the hard
way, after the fact,
after a couple of incidents,
but what is effective is bringing
an external perspective.
So I myself have a more positive,
constructive way to do it.
Inviting external, well
established companies
to present to the board of directors.
- So we're gonna play a little
game called this or that.
And so I'm gonna give
you two different things
that I'm going to give you a description
and you're gonna tell
me which one of those
matches the description.
- [Mauricio] Okay.
- [Brad] Okay.
Now I want you to tell
me if I'm describing
a blind date or a proof of concept
for some kind of a security offering.
- Okay.
- [Brad] First, you can't believe
you let someone you
trust talk you into this.
- I would say my initial answer was both.
- Yes.
- I mean it can go either way.
Cannot play for both.
- Yeah. Perfect. That's exactly right.
- Okay, more than a few
times you've wondered,
am I better of with
familiar disappointments,
rather than new adventures.
- Oh I'll go for the second one.
(laughing)
The proof-of-concept.
- That's what I thought too.
You get stuck with the bill at the end.
(laughing)
- Okay, okay.
Proof of concept for sure.
Blind date very likely will be as well.
(laughing)
- [Brad] Yeah so one of
these that you've mentioned
that I thought was really interesting was
you know, the move to the cloud,
more and more mobile devices being used,
what you're being asked to protect
is expanding and it's going outside of
the traditional confines of the perimeter
that, you know, we've
all used for security.
Now, you know, Dow,
big user of Office 365,
big user of enterprise
mobility and security,
what kind of a role did you play
as these decisions were being made to move
to these cloud services?
- [Mauricio] We understand
the value of cloud,
we have a vision that in two, three years
eighty percent of our
information will be..
- Eighty percent?
- in the cloud, and we
are moving aggressively
into that direction.
So the way we are approaching cloud,
we said, okay, let's do
it in an organized way,
meaning that we will partner with
enterprise class providers.
- Yup.
- That's kind of the first key topic,
I mean, instead of going here and there,
we pick few cloud suppliers and say, okay,
we will partner with those.
After that, we will look
for industry certifications,
making sure that cloud providers,
like Microsoft, give
us good certification,
industry certifications, SOC reports,
that helps us feeling more comfortable
that our information is in good hands.
After that we need partnership,
that's the type of partnership
that we have established
with Microsoft, meaning that
we have permanent dialogue,
that you keep us updated
on what you're doing,
what is our new roadmap in the cloud,
what is the roadmap in
collaboration tools,
what is the roadmap for
digital transformation.
Understanding that cloud needs to mature.
We are in the early stages of cloud.
The basics are there but there is more
that needs to be done
in the area of security.
Directionally, I do
believe, or we do believe
at Dow, that's the way to go.
And as a matter of fact,
that's what the IT industry
is going to be doing.
- Everyone's gonna head there,
it's just at what pace.
- It's just when.
(playful music)
- [Brad] Next time on Brad
Anderson's lunch break,
- [Mauricio] Cyber security
is not implementing
a couple of firewalls here
and this and that and that.
It's making sure that from
the executive level down
the companies understand and
properly manage their risk.

hi everyone hope you all are following
this 32 series without wasting any
further time let's move on to today's
points we are going to start with crude
resection techniques point number one
ready section
it means removal of only root portion
without removal of Krone number two
Hemme section in this one root and it's
corresponding crown are section and
removed in Hemi section one half will be
removed another half can be written as
shown in the picture above number four
bicuspid ization in this tooth is cut
into two portions without rimmel of any
crowd or road number five in bicuspid
ization both halves can be written now
let's move on to luxation injuries
number six subluxation
it means abnormal loosening of tooth
without any displacement number seven
concussion it means sensitive to
percussion here there is no abnormal
loosening nor displacement of the tooth
number eight extrusion here the tooth is
displaced out of its socket and you can
also observe increased burial space in I
ope
number nine intrusion it means central
dislocation it is the most severe form
of all excisions here the tooth appears
short number ten late relaxation
here the tooth will be displaced in a
direction other than axial
number eleven avulsion also called X
articulation here complete displacement
of tooth out of socket can be seen point
to the remember DS teeth with intrusion
and later luxation has metallic sound
and percussion
now shall start studying about
immunoglobulins number twelve
IgG it is largest in number around 75 to
80 percent and it has placental support
number thirteen I GE it is second most
abundant it is presenting breast milk
saliva and tears number fourteen IgM it
is largest in size first antibody
detected off her injection number
fifteen IgE it is stipend enough
lattices for hypersensitivity or
allergic response number sixteen i GD it
is for differentiation of billion
fascitis coming to immunity point number
seventeen immunities of two types innate
and acquired acquired immunity is of two
types again that is active immunity and
passive immunity
point number nineteen antibodies
produced in person's body is called
active immunity and antibodies from
another organism in the person's body is
called passive immunity these are often
types again that is natural and
artificial
let's slip into that examples number
twenty two active natural immunity it
means pathogen entered the body in
natural manner like catching the coal
number 23 active artificial immunity it
is acquired in form of vaccinations
number 24 passive natural immunity it is
acquired through placenta into uterus
number 25
parcel artificial immunity it is
acquired through anti-tetanus injections
moving on to hypersensitivity reactions
we are going to discuss them as type of
reaction and it's prototyping disorder
number 26
- hypersensitivity reaction or immediate
hypersensitivity reaction the
prototyping disorder seen are enough
Alexis alleges bronchial asthma number
27
type ii reaction or antibody mediated
hypersensitivity reaction the disorders
are autoimmune hemolytic anemia and
goodpasture's syndrome number 28 type 3
or immune complex mediated
hypersensitivity reaction in this the
prototyping disorders are McLucas at the
mitosis some form of glomerulonephritis
serum sickness an adverse reaction
member 29 cell mediated or fight for
hypersensitivity they disorder seen in
this earth contact dermatitis multiple
sclerosis type 1 diabetes rheumatoid
arthritis and tuberculosis you can
remember these reactions as a CID
anaphylaxis cytotoxic immune complex and
delayed type hypersensitivity moving on
to the last part of this video it is
about injection sites point number 30
intramuscular injection and excitement
for preterm neonates and infants
the site is anterolateral type it is the
junction of middle and lower third of
time for toddlers and older children
recite is deltoid or entre later on type
for adults and adults the injection site
is deltoid region
number 31 subcutaneous injections and
excitement for infants it is on type and
for children over 12 months it is on
outer thighs hips
number 32 intradermal injection and its
site for all ages the site is less
deltoid region that's it for today guys
keep on revising these points study hard
and don't waste any time we'll meet soon
with one more new video

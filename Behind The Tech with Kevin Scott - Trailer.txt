>> You're going to
see the future.
>> In these podcasts episodes,
we're going to get
behind the tech.
We're going to talk with some of
the people that have made
our modern technological
world possible,
and understand what motivated
them to do what they did.
They had a great idea.
They had passion about
a particular thing
and they did it,
and it benefited all of us
in this really awesome way,
and shouldn't we care about that?
I think history is valuable
in a ton of different ways,
like helping you
not get too damned
excited over the thing
that you've just
invented that you
really didn't invent
because it's been invented
ten times already,
and if you knew that,
maybe you could have saved
yourself just
a little bit of work.
I'd love for developers
of all ages to listen,
so people who are early
in their career to
learn a little bit about
the history of the industry,
and maybe to get
some insight and perspective
on what it means to be
a really great engineer.
Wow, it's great that I
can see this person who,
in a whole bunch of ways,
is like me and
maybe that inspires
me to go off and do
something awesome.
I think there are also
a bunch of folks like me,
where it's going to be
all kinds of nostalgic.
You know just, "Oh
my God, I remember that."
Like the walk down memory lane.
What I want people to get out
of the show is inspiration.
I want them to be a
little more informed
about the history of computing,
and what's happening now behind
the scenes they might
not otherwise see.
And I think all of that's
important because technology
is such a huge part of
all of our daily lives,
that even those of us who aren't
engineers should understand
a little bit more about
what's going on behind
the tech that is
suffusing our lives.
I'm Kevin Scott, Chief
Technology Officer at Microsoft.
In my new podcast,
I'll be talking with really cool
people who have done and are
still building
really amazing technology.
So sign up and tune in so
we geek out this summer.

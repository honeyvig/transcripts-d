Our vision is to be the foremost
educational air and
space museum in the world.
>> Let me tell you about a B-17.
It was a marvelous airplane.
>> And we were giving tours of
our B-17, but that's just not
possible to keep it preserved and
accessible to visitors.
And so we are working on ways to
interpret the interior of the B-17
through digital technology and
the stories that go along with it.
>> Microsoft has being doing so
much experimentation in VR and
AR in 360-degree photography and
technology.
We could utilize that and
really bring it out onto
the floor here at the museum.
>> To help people and every
organization on the planet achieve
more, we'd love to do hands-on
experiences like this, where people
can touch the technology,
immediately see the value and
do things that they
never imagined possible.
>> We knew that we both had the same
vision about experimenting,
trying out new things.
>> You take this camera, and
you move it along the plane.
And at the end, all this
information comes together into
a 3D model that is being
processed in the cloud.
>> We are able to give
access to aircraft and
artifacts that have never been
seen by the public before.
Then our docents are able to
share their own personal stories,
their own histories with
the aircraft in ways that
have never been done before.
>> It's really about storytelling
to pass on ideas and
concepts to the next generation.
>> And these are the kind of
things that we can then share
around the world.
>> This is a great example of how
technology enables accessibility for
everybody to enjoy displays
on any device at any time.
>> I can have it with
me everywhere I go.
It's like having
the museum in your pocket.
>> We're very proud that Microsoft
can help make the experience
much more immersive and much more
interactive for their visitors.
>> The response that we're getting
from visitors is just, wow.
And this is just
an exciting first step.

hi everyone I am dr. Amrita patnik oral
and maxillofacial surgeon from the team
MDS conquer here is a video of 32 points
on amalgam topic prepared based on eat
as well as aims point of view now we
shall see the first point father of
amalgam is dr. Lewis Ragnar point number
2 ad specification number of amalgam is
one point number three maximum expansion
that can occur in the case of delayed
expansion is 400 micrometers per
centimeter that is four percentage point
number four the self sailing ability of
low corporate algum is better than that
of high copper amalgam as the rate of
corrosion is more in low copper amalgam
the self sealing material is amalgam
where a self-healing material is
composite
point number five what is an amalgam
tattoo it is nothing but a great blue or
black area of discoloration on the
mucous membrane of the mouth typically
on the lower job disclosed you to the
entry of amalgam into the soft tissues
point number six what is an amalgam blue
the heart tissue that is the tooth this
condition is caused by the entry of
corrosive products into the dentinal
tubules which causes tooth discoloration
that is blue discoloration hence it is
called as amalgam blue for number seven
the condensation pressure of amalgam is
three to four pounds point number eight
what is an amalgam crime amalgam should
be hard enough to offer assistance to
carving instrument then a scraping or a
ringing sound should be heard it is
known as amalgam crime point number ten
capo surface angle for amalgam is around
ninety degree that is part point number
eleven
minimum bulk for amalgam restoration is
1.5 mm point number twelve depth of
amalgam restorations be around 1.5 to 2
mm point number thirteen the ideal bit
for amalgam cavity should be around 1/3
to 1/4 of intercoastal distance in
adults whereas in children it should be
around one-fifth of in Turkish pen
distance for number fourteen minimum
amount of marginal tooth structure to be
preserved is around 2 mm in molars and
1.6 mm in premolars
[Music]
for number 15 reverse curve in occlusal
outline is usually created when vzo
facial enamel wall is parallel to enamel
rod direction
point number 16 to avoid pal pal
irritation minimum remaining dentin
thickness should be 2 mm for number 17
the eggs yo pal pal depth of the
proximal box in class 2 cavity is 0.2 to
0.8 mm fine number 18 gingerly the depth
of class 1 cavity is 0.75 to 1 mm point
number 19 the tip diameter of number 2
for five baths is 0.8 mm point number 20
secondary written the features are fins
slots retentive
grooves skirts coves and locks point
number 21 initial depth of an amalgam
restorations should be zero point 2
women into dentin point number 22
thickness of paste in an amalgam
restorations should be 0.5 mm point
number 23 mercury to amalgam ratio
should be 1 is to 1 that is Eames
technique
point number 29 the higher condensation
pressures are required to minimize the
porosity and express mercury from the
late cut amalgam point number 30
increased condensation pressure is
required for late cut amalgam
now here for late cut amalgam we got to
use smaller condenser tip point number
31 decreased condensation pressure is
required for a spherical amalgam for
this larger condenser tip is used for
number 32 faces of amalgam our beta

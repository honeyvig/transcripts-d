collaboration
automation anywhere supports platforms
like javascript python and vbscript as
well as advanced variable capabilities
another key feature is its versatile
architecture that allows for the
addition of new command packages
let's look at the automation anywhere
components
the first component is automation
anywhere robotic interface
aari
it is a user-friendly interface that
allows business users to collaborate
with bots
users can initiate process automation
provide feedback to the bots in order
for process to be resumed and escalate
requests to additional users for
downstream processing
aari that is automation anywhere robotic
interface enables enterprises to unlock
previously unavailable automation
opportunities between humans and the
bots
iqbot an intelligent document processing

bots automatically
discovery bot collaborates with business
workers to identify automation
opportunities that can maximize the
return on your rpa investment
let's look at the architecture of
automation anywhere
automation anywhere platform is built
using a distributed architecture
the enterprise control room a web-based
platform that manages the development
and execution of digital workforce
provides centralized management bot
creators and bot runners are linked to
the enterprise control room
bot creators are software development
platforms for authorizing and
customizing automations
bot runners are runtime system deployed
on the machine that carry out the
automations
bot runners can be installed on desktops
in data centers or in the cloud
let's explore the architecture in detail
what creators a bot is a self-contained
task that requires little to no human
intervention to complete the bot creator
is a customized development client for
automation anywhere that is used to
create bots
task editor event watcher bot player
auto login and local scheduler are all
included
the bot creator also includes the
ability to create boards from a device
utilizing the enterprise client
application the device is registered
with the enterprise control room after
the bot creator user signs in for the
first time and the user can deploy bots
on that device
bought runners
a bot trainer has the ability to run
bots from a device utilizing the
enterprise client application the device
is registered with the enterprise
control room after the bot runner users
log in for the first time and the user
can deploy bots on that device
ports are run by the bot runner which is
a software machine
bot runners can run bots at scale after
they have been developed with bot create
control room
the enterprise control room serves as a
single point of management for all bots
enterprise control room is placed on a
server in the data center and configured
to work with the other data center
components a river proxy is in charge of
listening for request for remote
connections and sending them to the
appropriate specialized
service using a collection of
specialized web service the enterprise
control room manages schedules executes
and configures various bots and bot
runner capabilities
let's look at the types of bots in
automation anywhere
task bot
task bots are used for automating
repetitive tasks based on the rules
these tasks are simple to create and can
reliably complete multi-step procedures
document administration claims
management hr departments i.t and other
areas benefit from task bots they
increase production reduce errors and
save money
metabot metabots are more advanced
version of task bots metabots are
automation building components that help
with next generation integration
scalability these are intended for
scalable complex process on a computer
metabots are used to automate
applications application apis visual
captures and integration flow can all be
used to develop meta bots
iqbot
iq bots are the next generation of
intelligent bots with the ability to
think like humans these bots are
designed to learn on their own and carry
out tasks in accordance with that
learning
users can experience the potential of
automation with iq bots
which use advanced cognitive technology
and advanced artificial technologies
these bots have capabilities such as
self-learning decision making and
subject matter expertise among others
data can be extracted from
semi-structured and unstructured data by
these bots
iq bots also learn to recognize patterns
so that the bot knows exactly what to do
the next time the pattern appears
iq bots also learn to recognize patterns
so that the bot knows exactly what to do
the next time the pattern appears with
each human confirmation it learns and
improves its ability to carry out the
act benefits of using automation
anywhere
time saving an easy to use interface
that allows users of varying skill
levels to easily use the product and
accelerate the learning process with
instant web-based deployment you can get
started with writing bots right away
business adaptability automation
anywhere provides regular updates
ensuring that you are always up to date
on any device anywhere it provides
continuity of operations with high
availability and disaster recovery
low cost of ownership there is no need
for additional infrastructure investment
it gives low cost maintenance
a unified platform for front office back
office and employee applications is
provided
let's look at the demo
so let's see a demo in this demo
we'll create a bot which will
automatically
login inside the simply learn login page
so i'll show you
let's go to the browser i'll go to the
simply learns page
so
this is the simply launch login page
so in this page the bot will
automatically enter the email address
password and it will click on the login
button and it will take you inside the
simply lens page
so we'll create a bot
so i'll show you how the bot works
so i have created it
let's see the output first and then
we'll get started with the
project
so i'll click on the run button
it will download all the dependencies
here you can see it's entering the email
address
it's entering the password and it will
click on the login button
so this is the project this is the
output
so you have seen the output so let's get
started
we'll close this go to the
go to the mail which you received from
the automation anywhere and click on the
control room link and you will open up
here
after coming here
click on create a bot
so enter a name
let's say
we'll enter as login bot
since we are
creating a
project to login
if you want you can give the description
and next click on create and edit
there are three options here flow
list and dual
in the flow it only shows the flowchart
of what activities or actions you are
dragging and dropping it in the list it
shows the in the form of the list all
the actions and in the dual it shows the
flowchart as well as the actions what
actions it is performing
so first we need the browser option
so we'll search for the browser action
so this is the browser action
so the browser package contains actions
that enable you to download file find
broken lines
and launch a website
so this package basically supports
internet explorer microsoft edge and
google chrome browsers
so the browser package includes the
actions like close download file get
source code find broken lines go back
open run javascript
now for us to open the browser to open
the simply learns website we need the
open option so let's click on the open
double click on the open
so what open does is opens the browser
to a specific web page whichever webpage
link we provides it opens that browser
so what we want to open do we want to
open it in the existing tab or a new tab
or a new window so in existing tab it
opens the web page in the currently open
tab
so this existing tab option is only
available in the google chrome browser
and new tab opens the web page in a new
tab like select the tab from the list of
the active tabs in the google chrome
browser or insert a new window variable
and in the new window this opens a
webpage in the new window or office
specific browser whichever browser you
choose it opens a web page in a new
window
so all these options are applicable in
the google chrome browser
so we will select the new window option
and the browser okay you have these
options
internet explorer mozilla firefox chrome
and microsoft edge so we will select
google chrome
and we'll select the link to open
so
we should select the link so we'll go to
the simplylands website page
so this is the page we are logging in so
that is why we need the link of this
page so copy the link of this page
and paste the link here
and we need it in the new window
so save it
and let's run and see if this opens in
the new window
let's click on run
okay so till now
we are going right so we have entered
the link and we have run the bot and the
bot is opening the webpage in the new
window
so we'll close this
so after this we need the recorder
package
so search for the recorder package
so this is the recorder package in this
we have the capture action so the
capture action from the recorder package
is used to capture an interaction with
the user interface object such as a text
box button table menu radio button combo
box check box list view link tree and
package tab the capture action enables
you to add single interaction when
building your bot
so let's double click
on capture option
so let's select dual
so that we can see what action it
triggers
so after selecting the capture option
so select the browser option browser
window then
click on this refresh windows
so it will show a list of uh
so it will show the list of pages that
are open in the browser
so scroll down
and we need learning on simply
so this is the web page
in which we are logging in so select the
web page
go down
and let's click on capture object click
on capture object
so first we need to fill in the email
address so you can see here it's showing
a red color box
so click on email address
so it will capture this object of email
address here you can see recording
capture finalization
so the object is
captured
scroll down and here you can see action
to take on object what action should be
taken on the object which we have
selected
so
we need to
enter the text that is the email address
so select set text
and scroll down
and enter what text you want to enter
that
so i'll enter my email id
now scroll down
you can enter the time how much ever you
want
it is recommended to enter a 9 seconds
or 10 seconds but it's optional so we'll
skip it for now
you can see here it's the object type
user login
page
so we have captured the first object
that is email address so we'll save it
and we'll run and see if it's entering
the email address
here you can see
it's open the web page in the new window
and it has entered the email address
so let's go back to the control room
close this
your bot has run successfully
so now that we have entered the email
address we need to enter the password so
we will
use another capture
action
and this will will select the same
browser window
and will select the same
learning on simply done
website
and we'll click on capture object
but now this time we'll capture the
object
password
select the password
object
and recording capture finalization
so now that the
object is captured we need to
select the action what action should be
performed
so we will select set text
now that we have selected text
since we are entering the password the
password should be credential
and when the password is credentialed
you can't enter the password here you
need to pick the password
you need to pick the password from the
locker room
so
now that
now that i have already created a
credential and entered in the locker
room for me it's showing here i'll show
you how to
create a credential and create a locker
room
so we'll save it till here for now we'll
save here
let's go to the credentials section
here if you go
in the
manage options you can see credentials
so go in the credentials
this is the credentials which i have
already created
go to the create credential options
click on it so enter the credential name
say i'll enter it as username
enter the description if you want any
and scroll down
and enter the attribute name
what attribute are you entering for
first we will enter the email address
so
select email address
and
select the input type as standard
description is optional
and enter the value what is the email
address so i'll enter my email address
scroll down and click on the plus here
to add
so there are two attributes in the login
page right that is the email address and
password so one attribute we have
entered the email address and the other
attribute is the password attribute so
select password
and input type as standard and since we
are entering the password it should be
masked
so that no one could see your password
the password should be encrypted so
enter your password here
after entering the password
so you have created the
you have filled all the credential
details click on create credential
so after clicking on create credential
your credential will be created
so that is how you create a credential
after creating the credential
so since i have already created a
credential i'll click on cancel before
creating
if you want to create the credential
enter all these details and click on the
create page so i'll click on cancel so
this is once you create the credential
you can see
like this a credential whatever you have
created it will be shown here
so this is how you create a credential
now after creating the credential you
need to
go to the locker section
and here you can see
create a locker
click on create a locker
so enter the locker room whatever you
want
so let us enter username
after entering the locker room
go to the credential
and select the credential whatever you
have created
since i have already entered the
credential in the locker that is why it
is
that is why this is disabled for me so
when you are entering the credential in
the locker room for the first time
can come inside the locker and select
this option check this option and click
on this so this will get
this will get deposited in the locker
this owners and managers section is
disabled the community edition so we
can't do any changes in that this will
also be disabled
this will also be disabled
go to the consumers
so enable this
enable this click on the
community edition user and
get deposit this in the locker click on
this
then scroll down so this is the last
then when you go back scroll up when you
finish doing all this this create locker
option will get enabled so when this
option get enabled click on create
locker and your locker will be created
that's how you create a blocker
since i have already created a locker i
did not
so this options are not enabled for me
so this option is also not enabled when
you do all these steps this option gets
enabled
that is how you create a locker i hope
you have understood how to create a
credential and how to create a locker
so let's go back to the bot which we had
created let's go to the automation
so the bot which we had created was a
login bot
so we had selected the recorder
option in this recorder we had selected
the
action
password so we need to enter the
password so
select here go to here
click on pick
and select the locker which we had
created the email address
select the credential that is the email

here you can see we have picked the
password if you want you can enter the
time which is optional
you can see it is of the type user
password
so that's all save it
now we need a one more recorder action
that is to click on the
login button
so we'll select for the search for the
recorder
select the capture option
and we'll select the browser
select the web page
and click on the capture object
so the object which we are capturing now
is the login button so click on the
login button
here you can see recording capture
finalization
so the login button is been captured
so what action should be taken
so we need to click on the login button
here you can see if you have noticed
there is no option to set text
why because this is a login button when
we can't enter the text here so that
option is not here

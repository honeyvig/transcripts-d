hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
Team MDS conquer in this video we are
going to discuss 32 important points
from the topic of fractures point number
one the fracture of tooth bearing
segment of mandible is compound fracture
number two most common complication of
condylar injuries in children ease and
Colossus number three the fracture of
mandible should be immobilized for an
average of six weeks number four the
displaced mandibular fracture in a child
should be managed by early mobilization
number five president wiring is
indicated first symphysis fracture
number six fracture of mandible not
involving the dental arch is treated by
open reduction number seven the splint
which is most commonly used in dental
and a Beulah fracture is caps pin number
eight this filling behind the ear such
as fracture of condyle
number nine direct impact on the bone
will produce a transverse fracture
number ten the optimum length of screw
for fixation of played in mandible is
4mm number eleven Eber nation is seen in
non-union number twelve direct
interdental wiring is known as Gilmer's

open reduction and internal fixation is

if fracture in void dented segment
occlusion acts as guide for reduction
and hence SATCOM and blur wiring with
caps lenses
treatment of choice number 27 if the
fracture does not involve the dented
portion the occlusion cannot act as a

of compression in symphysis region is
located at lower border number 30 a
displaced unfavorable fracture in the
mandibular angle region is a potentially
difficult fracture to treat because of
distraction of fracture signals by
multiple number 31 ideal time period of
immobilization of avulsed to this seven
to ten days whereas for immobilization
of fractured mandible is six weeks
that's it for today's session guys all
the points discussed in this video are
very important from neater names point
of view so keep on revising them all the
best thank you

- [Brad] It's lunch time
and this is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
(upbeat music)
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Wherever I can, I try to take advantage
of both of these things and grab lunch
with some of the tech
industry's best and brightest.
Today I'm talking with veteran
tech journalist Tim Anderson.
(cheerful piano music)
- [Brad] Hey Tim good
afternoon, how are you?
- [Tim] Good to see you!
- [Brad] Good to see you as well.
Tim, you've been covering
technology for a really long time.
What was the first piece you wrote?
- Well I think it was about 1988 or 1989.
- [Brad] Do you remember
what it was about,
your first article?
- It was about the Atari ST.
- Wow okay.
- Which you may remember
as a games machine
but it was quite popular
as a business computer
that was much better
value than a Macintosh
if you wanted to have
a graphical interface.
- Yeah.
- [Tim] Pretty fantastic
machine for its day.
- So you talk about the move to the Cloud
has gone faster than
what you had anticipated.
What are the primary reasons
driving that accelerated move?
- One is that the fear aspect
is diminishing as people see
other organizations moving
to the Cloud successfully
and it's working for them.
There are sectors in which
you cannot afford not to move
to the Cloud because it is
a competitive advantage.
- Yeah.
- If you ignore the competitive advantage
eventually your competitors
get ahead of you.
One of things that we've
seen in recent years
is where the Cloud
solutions have got features
which are effectively
unmatchable on premises
except perhaps with the
very largest enterprises.
- Yep.
- We've seen companies
put features into their
Cloud offerings that are ahead
of and with a higher rate
of improvement than they
achieve for their on-premises.
- Yeah.
- Deployments.
- Yeah.
What are companies that are successfully
modernizing themselves doing differently
than those who are kind of like slow?
- One of the things that
I've always seen in my
technology coverage over
the years has been that
even when the technology is fantastic,
it can't succeed if the
organizational culture is wrong.
The lesson there is that you have to
be willing to change your culture
as well as your computing to
make best use of technology.
- I have seen organizations
who have also tried
to move to a new technology,
to a new way of doing things.
But without changing their culture
it fails or takes longer than it should.
- Cloud is a challenge
here because we have seen
in certain respects the power, if you like
of the IT organization within a business
has in some respects declined.
Because they're no longer
masters of their own kingdom
in terms of everything has to
happen in their base center.
And letting go of some
of those responsibilities
is challenging and difficult.
- That's definitely a
cultural change but would you
also argue that by letting
go of some of those pieces
that were really kind of important
but not necessarily adding
value to their business
does it free time for IT to
be able to add more value?
- Well of course and
there's still a shortage
of the IT contribution,
if you like, to a business
whether that's in terms
of developing applications
or improving applications,
or whether it's in terms
of just enabling users
to make better use of the resources
that are available to them.
It does somewhat break
my heart to see users
with a hugely rich range of resources
that are available in
something like Office 365,
those types of services, but using only
a tiny fraction, using just the email.
- Or you move to a Cloud
service that has so much more
capability but you only do
what you did in the past
and don't take advantage
of the new capabilities.
- Right.
- [Brad] Yeah, that's sad.
- [Tim] Yeah.
- [Brad] Next time on Brad
Anderson's Lunch Break.
- Every organization has
got data that it cares about
and what we care about
most in terms of security
is who has access to that data.
- [Brad] Exactly.
- And also we perhaps care about
who doesn't have access to that data.
- Well said.
- So clearly it's the identity
is at the heart of that.

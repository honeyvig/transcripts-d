in helping you brainstorm and organize

to your Niche That's The Power of
content plan first determine the niche
you're passionate about whether it's
technology Fitness travel or any other

Niche it's time to leverage chart GPT so
as you can see we have login our chat
GPT and you can simply ask chat GPT to
suggest blog post ideas for your chosen
topic for example you could type uh

so I'll just simply type
here and I'll just press enter so as you

post ideas and these are the topics we
can look into so these ideas aren just
random suggestions they are the building
blocks of your content calendar with
these topics in hand you can plan out
your blog post for the upcoming months
ensuring that your content creation is
consistent and targeted the approach not
only keeps your blog organized but also
helps you stay focused on delivering
value to your audience regularly so now
that we have a content planned in place
it's time to move on to the next crucial
part of the blogging process this step
will ensure that your blog post will not
only reach your audience but also rank
highly on search engine so you can pick
any topic you want from here suppose
suppose my topic is cyber security
threats in 2024 all right now the next
step is keyword research in the world of
blogging keywords are like GPS for your
content they guide your readers straight
to your blog so the next step is
conducting keyword research keywords are
essential for search engine optimization
which is SEO because they help your blog
rank higher in search engine result
making it easier for your target
audience to find your content with chat
GPT the process becomes incredibly
efficient you can start by asking chat
gbd to generate a list of potential
keywords for your blog for example uh
let's type here give me short tail and
long tail keywords give me short tail
and long tail keywords for the
particular topic which you have chosen
for example I've chosen this topic which
is cyber security threats in
2024 so I'll just press enter so as you
can see chat GPT will give a list of
short tail keywords and longtail
keywords as well it's important to
validate these keywords using an SEO
tool like Google Keyword Planner so you
can validate these keywords using Google
Keyword Planner so let me show you a
quick demo on how we can search using
Google Keyword Planner so I'll just type
here Google Keyword Planner so as you
can see I'll just simply sign in here so
here this is the interface of Google
Keyword Planner you just have to click
on discover new keywords and you can uh
type anything for example uh the topic
name is cyber
security cyber secur that's it and the
uh language you have selected is English
and we will click on get results so as
you can see that Google has given us a
list of all the keywords related to this
topic the broad level keywords we have
total 658 keywords ideas available you
can also add filter here and uh suppose
low range high range or exclude keywords
in my account anything you want to alter
and suppose I click your brand or
non-brand keyword
suppose you want keywords for your
platform like corsera cod Udi anything
so you can just untick the other brands
and then it will give you the keywords
related to that particular platform and
yes these are the monthly searches and
the
competition status everything you can
just simply see from here so these are
the keywords which are having monthly
searches of around 100K to 1 million all
right so you can pick any keyword from
here suppose this is cyber security I'll
just copy paste you can also download
your keywords so this is how you can
search your keywords using keyword
Google Keyword Planner so we'll go back
to chat gbt as you can see these tools
will provide you the valuable data such
as search volume keyword difficulty and
competition level this ensures that
you're targeting the right keywords that
can bring substantial traffic to your
blog so so by combining the power of
charge GPT with reliable SEO tools you
are setting the foundation for a well
optimized blog that can rank well and
attract the right audience now let's
move on to our next step which is
analyzing content gaps now that we have
understood the content plan and how do
we do the keyword research it's time to
gain a Competitive Edge by analyzing
content Gap so content gaps are
opportunities where your competitors
might be missing out and you can step in
to provide valuable content that fills
those voids so chat GPT can assist you
in this process by helping you to
analyze what top ranking blogs are doing
and how they might be lacking so we can
just simply uh type a prompt here which
is analyze the content gaps suppose

content
gaps and you can just mention the
competitor's blog post so we can simply
uh
search for that keyword which we have
chosen cyber security and you can see
the first blog post which is from Cisco
what is cyber security so we'll just uh
copy this domain I mean the web address
and here we'll just copy paste and just

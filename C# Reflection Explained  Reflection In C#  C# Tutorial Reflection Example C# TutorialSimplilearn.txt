the capacity of a computer program to
evaluate its behavior and code and make
changes is known as reflection for
example in c sharp reflection allows you
to observe and alter data about your
program during runtime
which has immense potential that you may
not be aware of right now
c sharp reflection capabilities
sometimes known as reflection are
tremendously powerful and surprisingly
simple to use
and on that note i'm weber khandelwal
and i welcome you all to our simply
learns youtube channel
today we'll be going over c-sharp
reflection
but first let me remind you that we have
our daily updates on numerous
technologies so if you are a techie
looking for the latest technological
advancement then try subscribing to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon so you never miss an
update from simply learn
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin our session with the
discussion on what is metadata
followed by a brief discussion on c
sharp reflection
then we will have an in-depth discussion
on type class
following that we will implement some of
the methods we have learned during this
session with a simple demo
finally we will conclude this session
with a quick look into the applications
of c-sharp reflection
so now let's get started with the
discussion on what a metadata is
first a metadata is a binary data stored
in a memory or language runtime portable
executive file
data is moved to another file section
when you build code from a portable
executable file
before copying the code to another file
partition it is transferred to msil that
is microsoft and intermediate language
next
the metadata contains all data types and
data members specified and referenced in
the assembly
the information is loaded from memory
when c c-sharp code is executed at
runtime
then the primary goal of c-sharp
metadata is to learn about the class the
data members inheritance and the data
type among other things
the files metadata is made up of tables
and heap data structure
at last
it is essential for a simple programming
paradigm
and eliminates the need of ideas that is
interface definition language files and
header files
next let's discuss what a c sharp
reflection is
first
reflection
is defined in a computer science as the
technique through which the computer
program may view and pictures its
structure and behavior
the system dot reflection namespace
contains the classes that provides
access to running programs metadata
next
the name space system dot reflection
allows you to acquire information about
the loaded assembly and their
constituents
such as classes methods and value types
there are many classes that are found in
system dot reflection name space
let's discuss
repeat
there are many classes that are found in
system dot reflection name space
let's discuss some of them
first up we have assembly
an assembly is a recyclable updatable
and self-describing component of a
common language runtime program
or more commonly known as clr program
and the assembly class will describe it
the assembly name
it describes the assemblies and its
distinguishable name
next we have member info
this one retrieves details about the
members properties and provides members
metadata
[Music]
then we have method info
this one explains the method class and
provides its metadata
next up we have constructor info
it explains the constructor class and
provides its metadata
next we have event info
it explains the event info and provides
its metadata
finally we have property info
this will identify a property's features
and makes its data metadata available
now that we have a good grasp on concept
like metadata and reflection let's have
a look at the most commonly used or
important class the type class
time declaration for class type
interface type enumeration kinds array
type
and value type and so on are represented
by c sharp type class it is found in
system namespace
it is derived from
system.reflection.memberinfo class
type class provides support for various
methods let's have a look at them
first up we have get type
this one give
the present type
then we have a get type with a string as
an argument
this gives the type of a given argument
next up we have
get members
this one returns all the public members
for that type
then we have get members with an
argument as binding flags
this one will gets us a list of all the
members of the type that match the
specified requirement
given by binding flags
then we have get constructor
this one returns all the public
constructors for the type get
constructor
then we have a get constructor with an
argument as binding flags
this will gives gets us a list of all
the constructors of the type that match
the specified requirement
then we have get fields
this one returns all the public fields
for the type
then we have a get field with an
argument as binding flags
this one gets us a list of all the
fields of the type that match the
specified requirement
then we have get method
this one returns all the public methods
for the type
next step we have get methods with an
argument as binding flags
this one gets us a list of all the
methods of the type that matches the
specified requirements specified by
binding flags
finally we have credit get properties
set
this one returns all the public
properties for the type
then we have a get properties with the
binding flags as its argument
this one gets us a list of all the
properties
of the type that matches the specified
requirements now that we are familiar
with some of these methods let's get
let's go to our visual studio and check
them out
let's start by creating a new project
we will create
a console
application
note that we will be using the one which
can use a.net course
so
as well as fisher so we will use this
one
then we will go next
let's name it
as
simply
reflection
demo
then we can choose the location
according to you i'm using simply
project
then i will go click next
then we can use the target frameworks
i am using dotnet 5.0
you can use according to your need you
can also use 3.1
then we will hit create
now this will take some time to create
the project
here now we have
a typical project
now
we will right click on the solution
we will go add
and select
new project
this time we will be creating a class
library
make sure you are using a c sharp one
as well as which one that support dot
net core
then we will hit next
now
let's name this
as
simply
print
database
then we will hit next
we will again prompt us to choose the
framework we will be using the same one
which we used last time
so if you are using a 3.1 then select
3.1 if you are using 6.0 then use 6.0
then we will hit create
and here we have our first class library
now
let's write up some code for the
this simple simply run print database
classwork.cl
so
that's it enter here
we will start
with the private
string
employee
data
repeat
we will start with
private
string
employee
name
we'll enter
then we will have a public
void
simply
print
then in this we will have a console
dot write line
here we will be printing
from
simply print
we will create
another function
public
string
simply
get
named
let's close this to make space
then we will return
this
dot
employee name
then
we will make another
method
which will be public
bold
simply
print
name
this will have console
start
write line
here we will use dollar symbol
then we will write
employee
name
past
as
then we will have curly braces and we
will write
our variable employee name
then we'll get out of this
next
let's write another one of the function
this will be a private method
so private
void
simply
print
private
then
here
we will use console
dot
write line
and return a message
as
printing
from
simply
print
private
after that
we will have
a public
employee
name
arrow
employee name
that was our variable
then
we have
a public
static
string
then we will have a static
employee
name
with an arrow pointing to
a message
static
property
employee
name
then we will have semicolon
now let's save this and go over
to our program folder
which is basically
our simply learn reflection dot demo
program file
now let's write a code for this one
delete this part
but first let's go back here and build
this
we will rebuild solution
we did that because we wanted
this part
simply print database dot dll file we'll
copy this
we'll be needing this
for our next form
so now we are here
let's add some
namespaces so using
[Music]
system
dot
link
also we will be using
system
dot
reflection
so now
let's get started
we will go to our main block
and then we will have
where
which we'll name this as
simply
assembly
equals to
assembly
dot
load
from
then we will have added
and we will copy paste this
path we copy this last time
semicolon
then we will hit enter
then we will have a 4-h
then we will have
bar
type
n
simply
assembly
dot
get
types
then
we will print out
console
start
write line
then we will have a dollar symbol
then in bracket
we will write
as type
colon
then we will have type
dot
name
then we will have
another control line
dot
right
line
here you will add a simple line to make
the transition
next
we will write
a variable
simply
instance
which will be equals to
activator
dot
create
instance
type
basically this activator will help us in
change
in changing the values at runtime
now we will write some for each
statements
so we will have first four each
and this one
will have
var
field
in
type
dot
get
fields
now we will have some binding flags
dot
non-public
then
we will do r
we have
binding flags
dot
instance
then
we have
binding fly
dot
declared only
then
in this
body we will have
a console
dot
right line
we will have a dollar symbol
then
we will write field
then in curly braces
we will have
field
dot
name
now we will be making the similar types
of 4-h statements again and again
let's also
write a command
to set a value to these fields
so
let's have command as field
dot
set
value
then
we will have
simply instant
comma
we can write any name here
let's read write things
then we'll hit enter
now let's get out of this 4-h
and here we will write another one of
console
dot
write line
then
we will have another one of those
dividers
next
we will have another for each let's copy
this
the earlier one so that we don't have to
do that again and again
let's close this
ctrl z
now the next one
will be on method
so we will change
password here
in
type dot get
methods
now
this one
we will also have
a binding flag
dot
public
and for the declared only part
we also have
a bear command
where
this m
should be
not equals to
m
dot
is
special
name
then
in the body we will have
our first data as method
then we will have
method name
as per
let's clear this one up
now
let's have f block
method
dot
get
parameters
dot
length
is
greater than zero
then
we will invoke
method
dot
invoke
simply instance
comma
new
array
then in curly braces
you will give it the name as beta
else
if
method
dot return
type
dot
name
is not equals to
void
then
we will have
bad
return
value
equals to
method
dot invoke
then we will have
simply instance
comma
null
then we will have an else block
in the address block we will have
method
start
[Music]
then we will have
simply
instant
comma
null
then we have this console.writelinelife
similarly
we will write a code for the property
so
let's write a fully for reach
with that argument as where
type
in
type
dot
get
properties
then we will have
console
start
write line
then we will have dollar symbol
and we will print out property
curly braces
property
dot
name
in the next line
we will have a var
with
with that variable name as
property
[Music]
value
equals to
property
dot get
value
and it will take the property value from
simply instance
then
we will have another print statement
console
dot
write line
we have total assemble
then we will have property
value
then
in the curly braces
you will have
property
value
sample then
outside we will have console
dot write line
then we will have divider
now
let's save this
and run it
make sure to save this one as well
let's run them
now as you can see
it has first
print the type
as class 1
which was the name of our class library
then we have method
then we have field which was our
employee name
then we have created a method which was
simply print which was printing printing
from simply print then we also have
another method as simply get name
we have method as simply print name
then employee name was passed as team
then we have we also have simply print
private
which we are printing printing from
simply print private
now if you notice
in the
binding flags
for our methods i used a non-public and
a public
so
a non-public is responsible for printing
out the private method and for the
public
is responsible for printing out the
others
then
we have properties
for properties we have employee name
then
its value was changed because we passed
james as the new name
then we have a static employee since
it's a static employee name so
when we
changed the name to peter it didn't get
changed
and the property value was printed as
static property employment
now let's close this and get back to our
slides
finally let's discuss some of the
applications of c-sharp reflection
first it permits the creation of new
types
during runtime and executes various
actions utilizing those kinds
then we have attribute information that
can be seen during a runtime
following that we also have lead binding
which
two functions and attributes are
permitted
at last it also enables instantiating
inspecting numerous kinds within an
assembly

- Special Olympics USA Games and Microsoft
teamed up with KUOW to host
Ask A Special Olympics Athlete,
a person-to-person conversation
bringing together members
of the Puget Sound community
with Special Olympics athletes.
(people murmuring)
- [Ben] You're Devon?
- Yes.
- I'm Ben.
- Nice to meet you.
- So what do you think people
should know about the Special Olympics?
- Put it this way, just
'cause we have a disability
doesn't mean we can't
compete like everyone else.
- Come to a competition and watch.
See for yourself what people can do.
- And I get excited when they cheer me on.
- It's changed my life for the better,
and I am so thankful
that I'm a part of it.
- [Woman] What was your life like before?
- It's always been a little uncertain,
trying to navigate the waters of life,
and so now with it I have
much more confidence,
and I've been able to branch out
and just really be able
to show what I offer,
not just from sports but from life.
- My coach gave my mom a phone call
that by the way, Rebekah
was chosen for nationals.
- Yeah!
- Like yeah!
Yes!
I like it when people actually
take time to listen to me, you know?
- What do you want people to learn
from having USA Games in Seattle?
- Acceptance and also
that Special Olympics is
for all sorts of people with
all sorts of disabilities,
and all sorts of abilities too.
It's not just one thing.
- I feel like I'm part of a team,
and that they see me for who
I am and not my disability.
Growing up, I felt like an outsider,
and that no one wanted to sit by me
'cause I have Down syndrome.
But I kept all those negative vibes
and put it into this big
motivation for myself,
so I can keep moving forward
and to change their view of what I was.
And then all of a sudden,
Special Olympics came in,
and that gave me a real boost
of confidence within myself,
and it became a family of
friends, which I needed,
and that truly just changed
my whole entire life.
- Look at us and what we can
do, not by what we can't do.
Don't just jump to assumptions
or conclusions just
because somebody has autism
or Down syndrome or whatever.
- [Photographer] Awesome, thank you all.
(crew claps)
- [Rebekah] Look at what they can do
if you give 'em a chance.
- [Narrator] Come and
cheer on the athletes
July first through the sixth
as they compete in the
Special Olympics USA Games.

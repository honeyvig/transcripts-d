foreign
and I welcome you all to Simply learns
YouTube channel
today we will be going over the assembly
in C sharp
but first let me remind you that we have
a daily update on numerous Technologies
so if you are a tech geek looking for
the latest technological innovation then
try subscribing to our YouTube channel
and don't forget to hit that Bell icon
so you never miss an update on simply
run
so now without any further Ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session we will begin our session with
the discussion on what is assembly
we will also go over the content of the
assembly
after that we will discuss what an
assembly cache is
then we will have a look at the types of
assembly along with the global assembly
cache
finally we will write wrap this session
with the demo on private assembly
so
without without further let's get
started with the simple trivia
so now what is a metadata is it a data
about data creation a data about author
a data about the data type or all of the
above
make sure to comment down below
to answer your response
so now let's get started with the
discussion on what is c-sharp assembly
first an assembly is a combination of
types and resources intended to work
together to form a coherent block of
capabilities
based on the scope an assembly can be a
dll or an EXE
next for dotnet based application
assemblies are the primary components of
implementation versioning repurpose in
slash
installation scoping and privacy
authorization
reflection can be used to obtain
information about an assembly
programmatically
at last assembly provides the necessary
information for the common language
runtime that is CLR to be informed of
type implementation
a type does not exist anywhere except
the context of an assembly according to
the runtime
next let's go over the content of
assembly an assembly comprises of
seventh content first up manifest the
Manifest contains the data about all of
the parts that are considered to be the
part of the assembly itself
the data in the Manifest
is also referred to as a metadata
next up we have assembly name
now it helps inversion control and
visibility scope then we have version
information
the assembly's identity
it includes the version number
next type next is types the types Define
the scope and the boundary of methods
class six
properties events and attributes after
that we have locate which defines the
information about the language or the
culture
then we have cryptographic hash
it is the public key encoded hash acting
as the version security check
finally we have security permissions
the permissions that can be permitted
for all facets of the assembly's content
are determined by the Privileges within
the assembly
next up we have assembly cache
now when you install the dotnet SDK the
framework creates a repository on your
system
the assembly cache is the term coin for
this Repository
also the cache is divided into two
sections the private and global now
shared assemblies
are stored in the global cache
the private section may be may contain
restricted files for an application so
the files are downloaded by our
application during runtime are also
saved in this cache by private section
finally all assemblies in the global
cache must be shared and have distinct
name spaces
the folder name holds the information
about the assembly's distinct identity
the assembly Cache can be identified in
your windows directory in the assembly
subfolder
next let's go over the types of assembly
now there are two types of assembly in
dotnet
the process assembly
and the library assembly
process assembly hash dot exe files
while the library assemblies has dot dll
files
the library assemblies are of two types
we have a private assembly and shared
assembly or a public assembly
first up private assembly
private assemblies must be copied
separately in all applications folder
where the assembly's functionality are
to be used without copying
we cannot access the private assembly's
features and Power
now when we have a private assembly we
can only copy into the bin folder of
each application folder
next we have shared a public assembly
now it is not necessary to copy into
each application folder separately
the shared assembly is another name for
a public assembly
at the system level only one copy is
required there is no need to copy the
assembly into the application folder
next we have Global assembly cache when
an assembly is needed for more than one
project our application then we must
create it with the strong manager and
keep it in GSE or the assembly folder by
installating installing it within the
GSE util command
finally lets us understand the
assemblies by a demo
so we will move over
to our Visual Studio now here let's
create a new project
we will create a class Library
make sure it is of the C sharp type not
the F sharp
we will click next let's name this
a private Library
private assembly
then we will hit next
we will use the dotnet code 3.1 the long
term support
and we will hit create
first we will be creating some using
statement so we will be including some
libraries using using command
first we will have
system dot collection
dot generic
then we will have using
system
dot link
then we have using
system
dot text
next up
let's write up the code for this class
but first let's rename this class
to make it easier for us to understand
for the latest Regis let's name it
private assembly
this will ask us to change the class as
well so we will go ahead and click yes
and this will change the class as well
now let's write up some functions for
this private assemblies
so let's first have a public function
public and
let's have it an addition function
let's have argument here as well end and
one
comma and
N2
now
let's introduce a variable address to
store the result
N1 Plus
N2
next we will return
this rest
let's write another function similar to
this let's have a subtraction function
so public and
subtraction
so end
N1 comma
and and do
similarly we will introduce rest
function plus variable to store the
result
N1 minus N2
and we will return
dress
let's save this
now we will add another project
this will be a web application
so we'll head next
let's name this one as
private assembly web application
let's use the framework as 4.7.2
and hit create we will use the web form
so
let's click create
foreign
the web application
now let's
build both of these
okay so first what we will do is we will
right click this and go on open folder
in File Explorer
this is the folder
we will go into this bin folder
now what we are looking for here is the
privateassembly.dll which signifies that
the private assembly is now present
in our web application as well
so we have private assembly web
application.dll but not the private
assembly.dll so to do that we will go
back to our Visual Studio
laughs
so now what we will do is we will right
click on private assembly web
application
we will add
a reference
now
you might first see this assemblies
we will go to the project
the solution and we will see we have a
private assembly so we will right click
on it and click ok
now we will right click on this and go
back to that folder
then we will go to bin and here now we
have the private assembly.dll present
now let's go back to our slides
and this was all for today's session

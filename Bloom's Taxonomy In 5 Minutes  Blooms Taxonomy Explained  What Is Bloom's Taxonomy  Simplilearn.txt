meet ms rosa a form tutor
her students have recently completed
learning a module on human evolution
she wants to assess them on their
knowledge and understanding of the
concepts
it's her firm belief that a fish cannot
be assessed for its ability to climb a
tree
she understands that every student is an
individual learner and has different
skill sets and abilities
hence she wants to devise an assessment
that can do justice to all her students
that's when she came across bloom's
taxonomy a model to classify learning
objectives with appropriate verbs
it is a hierarchical framework for
categorizing educational learning
objectives according to their complexity
it was created by benjamin bloom who was
an american psychiatrist who made
several contributions to education
talent development and mastery learning
so
let's have a look at how ms rosa
assesses her students based on bloom's
taxonomy
currently bloom's taxonomy has six
levels of cognitive domains
the lowest level of bloom's taxonomy is
to remember
here ms rosa checks if her students are
able to recall the different stages of
human evolution
few of the verbs used to identify this
level are retrieve recognize and recall
the next stage is to understand
it is also known as comprehension
here ms rosa students are assessed on
their ability to summarize the different
stages of human evolution in their own
words
the students who are able to meet this
level exhibit a deeper understanding of
the concepts as compared to the previous
stage few of the verbs used to identify
this level are classify explain and
express
the third stage is to apply
this is the application stage where
students use their knowledge gained in a
new situation
here ms rosa students need to be able to
use their knowledge gained about human
evolution to predict the future of the
human race
use predict and demonstrate are a few of
the verbs used to identify this level
the fourth level of bloom's taxonomy is
to analyze wherein the concepts are
examined in detail and broken down into
parts
at this level ms rosa students need to
be able to investigate the stages of
human evolution and find evidence to
support the same
few of the verbs used to identify this
level are research establish and
appraise
the next level is to evaluate that is to
make a judgment
at this stage ms rosa students should be
able to present defend and justify their
viewpoints on human evolution
they should also be able to critique the
same
verbs like persuade validate and support
are used to identify this level
bloom's taxonomy's last level of
learning is to create where the students
possess the ability to build on what
they learned
at this stage ms rosa students should be
able to transform their knowledge of
human evolution to design relevant
projects
an example of this could be creating a
virtual museum with relevant artifacts
few of the verbs used to identify this
level are develop compose and formulate
those were the six levels of bloom's
taxonomy
with the help of this assessment tool ms
rosa was able to correctly assess her
students understanding of the human
evolution module
on that note here's a question for you
from the given options recognize the
correct order of bloom's taxonomy
1.
apply
remember analysis create
two
remember
analysis understand apply
three
remember understand apply
analyze
four
analyze understand evaluate create

as we saw how ms rosa's assessment was
made easier with bloom's taxonomy
the technique or concept is widely used
by psychologists curriculum theorists
and researchers to name a few
bloom's taxonomy provides a common
assessment language for a variety of
cognitive levels and transcends
different domains
an example of its application would be
in a scenario where a company is looking
to train its employees on customer
relations with the objective of
improving customer feedback
this school as stated is pretty
ambiguous and doesn't define what the
employees should specifically do
in such a scenario following bloom's
taxonomy ensures that the participants
are given lucid and measurable goals at
every level
the levels of bloom's taxonomy were
revised in 2001 and they are featured in

hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn
in this video we will discuss about
arduino and raspberry pi
the arduino and raspberry pi platforms
have grown in popularity among those
just getting started with electronics
and making real time projects
watch the video till the end we will
look at in-depth comparison between them
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simplyla so without
any further ado let's get started what
is arduino
arduino is an open source electronic
gadget that treats input such as light
on a sensor a finger on a button or a
tweet and generates output based on
those inputs such as turning on an led
or activating a motor
arduino was created at the design
institute as a simple tool for students
with no clear experience with
electronics or programming
arduino boards are microcontrollers not
entire computers with operating system
of their own like the raspberry pi
arduino just run c or c plus plus code
that is stored in the firmware
the arduino ide is free software that
allows you to create and upload code on
an arduino board
why arduino
arduino has been used in millions of
projects and applications due to its
simple and accessible user interface
the arduino software is simple to use
for beginners but it is customizable for
advanced users
it works on mac windows and linux
systems
arduino is a valuable tool for learning
new skills anyone including youngsters
amateurs artists and programmers can
begin tinkering by simply following the
step-by-step instructions
it can be used by teachers and students
to create low-cost scientific equipments
to demonstrate chemistry and physics
principles and to begin learning
programming and robotics
designers and architects create
interactive prototypes
while musicians and artists create
installations and try out new
instruments
features of arduino
arduino has microcontroller of omega 328
and the operating voltage is 5 volts
whereas the input voltage is recommended
to be from 7 to 12 volts and input
voltage limits from 6 to 20 volts
we have digital input output pins
that is we have 14 pins
and we have analog input six pins and we
have dc current per input output pin 40
milliampere
and dc current for 3.3 volt pin is 50
milliamperes and we have flash memory of
32 kilobytes
and we have sram of 2 kb
and eep rom of 1 kb
and we have block speed of 16 megahertz
now let us look at the different types
of arduino boards present
firstly we have arduino uno
arduino uno includes everything you will
need to get started it has 14 digital
input output pins 6 analog input a usb
port a power jack and a reset button
among other features it comes with
everything you will need to get started
with the microcontroller plug into a
computer with usb cable or power it with
an ac to dc adapter or battery
next we have lilypad arduino lillypad is
variable e-textile device created by lee
and designed in collaboration with
sparkfun each lily pad was cleverly
constructed with large connection pads
and a flat back to sew conductive thread
into garments
in addition the delhi pad features its
own set of input output power and sensor
boards designed exclusively for e-text
styles and can even be washed
arduino mega the arduino mega is the
larger brother of arduino uno it
contains many digital input output pins
that is 54
and 16 analog inputs a usb connection a
power jack and a reset button it comes
with everything you will need to get
started with microcontroller plug it
into a computer with usb cable or power
it with ac to dc adapter or a battery
red board arduino
the arduino ide can program the red
board over the use of mini b connector
it will run on windows 8 without
requiring changes to your security
settings
because of the usb chip we used it's
more sturdy and it's fully flat on the
back making it easier to integrate into
your projects
and we have arduino leonardo
the leonardo is arduino's initial
development board with a single
microcontroller and usb port
as a result it may be less expensive and
easier additionally because the board
handles usb directly code libraries are
available that allow the board to
imitate a computer keyboard mouse and
other components
now let us look at the advantages of
arduino
in comparison to the other
microcontroller system arduino boards
are comparatively affordable the
arduino's module is cheapest version can
be assembled by hand and even pre-made
arduino module cost less than 50 dollars
for windows macintosh os x and linux the
arduino software ide is provided the
vast majority of microcontroller systems
are windows only compatible
the arduino software is simple for
beginners but it's also flexible enough
for advanced users
for experienced programmers the arduino
software is available as an open source
tool to extend
people who want to learn more about the
language can use c plus libraries and
those who want to learn more about
technicals specifics can switch from
arduino to avrc programming language
the arduino is an open source and has
hardware that can be expanded the
arduino board blueprints are made
available under creative common license
allowing experienced circuits designers
to create their module version extending
and upgrading it
at last we will look at the
disadvantages of arduino
arduino cannot run multiple programs at
a time
no memory safety checks expensive for
cpu power and memory
it has lack of built-in communications
lack of built-in peripherals
the limited number of programming
languages
and a limited number of ides
the raspberry pi is a small low-cost
computer the size of a credit card that
connects to a computer monitor or
television and utilizes a conventional
keyboard and mouse
raspberry pi can do everything a desktop
computer does including accessing the
internet
using raspberry pi we can watch high
definition videos access spreadsheets
word processing and play games
the raspberry pi can communicate with
the outside world and has been used in
variety of digital maker projects
raspberry pi is also used in music
machines and parent detectors as well as
weather stations and tweeting bird
houses with infrared cameras
raspberry pi use cases
raspberry pi is using computer desktop a
simple desktop can be built using a
raspberry pi a micro sd card and a power
source an hdmi cable and a suitable
display such as an old monitor are also
required you will also need a usb
keyboard and a mouse
robotics controller there are numerous
raspberry pi robot controller projects a
specific robotics package for pi is
available which is powered by the device
battery and can be used to interface
with and control robots
printing using a raspberry pi with the
raspberry pi we can print anything all
we need is raspberry pi that's connected
to your home network as well as some
print server software this is
accomplished by first installing the
samba file sharing program then cups cup
stands for common unix printing system
includes printer drivers as well as
management console
game server
the basic operating system for raspberry
pi has a special version of minicraft
game pre-installed the raspberry pi
applications can be used as a game
server it's fantastic minicraft game
server a wonderful gaming experience can
be created by using many raspberry pi
game machine
as a retro gaming machine the raspberry
pi is perfect it is one of the machine's
lightest components the raspberry pi
zero in particular is a variant that can
fit into small locations and be used for
gaming projects the raspberry pi may
also be used to restore many popular
16-bit game systems
now let us look at the types of
raspberry pi
the different types of raspberry pi are
raspberry pi model b
raspberry pi model a
raspberry pi model b plus raspberry pi
model a plus raspberry pi zero raspberry
pi 2 raspberry pi 3 model b and
raspberry pi 0w
the different applications of raspberry
pi are it is used as media streamer
tablet computer internet radio
home automation
robotics command
arcade devices
cosmic computer
and different raspberry pi projects
now let us look at the advantages of
raspberry pi
raspberry pi is about the size of a
credit card
the raspberry pi is inexpensive
using raspberry pi to function as a
server is more efficient than using a
regular server
the raspberry pi is ideal for adaptive
technology because it can display
visuals as well as play movies
the micro computer can be used by small
businesses on a tight budget to use
their product or build new technology
that integrates the product
now let us look at the disadvantages of
raspberry pi
raspberry pi is not a computer
replacement and the processor is not as
fast downloading and installing software
takes time
so you won't be able to do any intricate
multitasking
other operating systems such as windows
are
incompatible this product will not be
beneficial for large-scale businesses
that already have large servers which
can perform all the tasks that raspberry
pi can
as a result it would not be worth it and
putting everything together it would
take time
so with that we have reached the end of

hi I'm Donovan Brown DevOps manager for
Microsoft I'd like to introduce you to
Azure test plans manual testing can be a
key testing technique to delivering a
great user experience as your test plan
offers the features you need to manage
your testing effort from manual and
exploratory testing to load and stress
testing let's jump right in and let me
show you how you can get started to
begin with manual testing I'm going to
start right here on the landing page of
dev Asia calm I know which project I
want to start testing with so from here
I can click on the test link this is
going to take me to my test plans before
you can add test cases you have to
create a test plan simply click this
link and enter a name a test plan is
made up of configurations test Suites
and test cases which can be broken down
into shared test steps and use
parameters let's begin by adding
configurations upon which we intend to
run our tests to add a configuration
click the configurations link and the
left navigation here you can review all
your configurations and configuration
variables we're going to be testing a
web application using Chrome and edge
both from Windows 10 we can edit the
existing windows configuration and add
the browser configuration variable and
set it to Chrome
now save the changes and let's add a
second configuration for Windows 10 and
edge
you
if we need to track additional
attributes of our configurations we
could add additional configuration
variables and the valid list of values
we can then add them to our
configurations but for now OS and
browser are all we need test
configurations can be assigned to the
entire test plan or individual test
Suites and even test cases assigning a
test configuration to the entire test
plan will ensure all test cases added
are automatically assign to those
configurations setting up your
configurations first and associating
them with your test plan makes creating
your test matrix snap with our
configuration set we can now start
adding test Suites which are collections
of test cases there are three different
types of test Suites static requirement
based and query based a static suite is
a logical container where you can add
any test cases you like when creating a
static test suite you just add a name
a requirement based test suite is where
you associate your test cases to a work
item to define its acceptance criteria
this linkage will be visible even
outside of your test plan
the final type is a query based suite
where you create a work item query to
select which test cases to include any
test cases that meet these criteria will
automatically be added to the test suite
let's edit a test case to see what they
are made of you have the steps to
execute in any expected results steps
that are repeated often can be extracted
as shared steps to ease with tests
maintenance lets associate the new
configuration to our test case once we
do you will notice our test case is now
listed twice once for each configuration
now we can run our test case and collect
the results notice that we can test web
applications and desktop applications as
well with the test runner being
web-based we can execute our test
anywhere including on a mobile device
now we simply follow the steps and pass
or fail them based on what we observe
the first step instructs the tester to
open the admin page
then open the security page and finally
click members to see if Stephen is shown
as we can see my name is the only one
listed so therefore this test step has
failed I'm able to leave a comment and
even follow bug
notice that the bug already has the
steps to repo filled in from the test
case
once I stopped testing my test status is
updated and I can continue with
additional testing
from the runs page I can review all my
previous test runs
before I go I want to encourage you to

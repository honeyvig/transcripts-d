kind of courses professionals should be
taking along with many other topic I
definitely recommend this course to
everyone after all when it comes to new
skills to advance your career there
should be no compromise you should
always learn from the band
in this introduction to python video we
will learn what is python the features
of python and where python is used
we will also look at the popular python
Frameworks and libraries and get an idea
about the best python Ides
then we will see the top companies using
Python Programming and get some hands-on
experience by learning the basics of
python on a Jupiter notebook
so let's get started with what is python
python is a high level object oriented
programming language developed by Guido
van Rossum in 1989 and was first
released in 1991.
python is often called A batteries
included language due to its
comprehensive standard Library
a fun fact about python is that the name
python was actually taken from the
popular BBC comedy show of that time
Monty Python's Flying Circus now let's
look at the top features of python
first so python has a simple structure
and a clearly defined syntax this allows
the Learners to pick up the language
quickly so it is easy to learn and use
python can run on different operating
systems such as Windows Linux and Mac
making it a portable language it enables
programmers to develop the software for
several competing platforms by writing
the program only once
third python is freely available at the
official website since it is open source
this means that source code is also
available to the public
a python uses an object-oriented
approach that encapsulates code within
objects
python provides a collection of
libraries for various tasks such as
machine learning web development and
data analysis
and finally
in Python you don't need to assign the
data type of the variable when you
assign some value to the variable it
automatically allocates the memory to
the variable at runtime
with that
let's move on to the uses of Python
programming
so Python programming language is used
to develop desktop applications and
build web applications too
it is properly used in the field of data
science machine learning and artificial
intelligence to analyze data build
predictive models and make business
decisions python is also widely used in
game development now
let's see some of the popular python
Frameworks and libraries
python can be used for web development
using Frameworks like xango flask
pyramid and cherry pie
now you can build graphical user
interfaces using libraries and
Frameworks such as tkinter or just
kinter
you can also use Pi gtk by qt or pygs or
python JavaScript
now python is also used to perform
machine learning tasks using libraries
such as tensorflow by torch scikit-learn
matplotlib and scipy
you can also perform mathematical
computations using numpy and pandas
now let's look at the best IDs that you
can use to write programs in Python and
perform specific tasks
so we have jupyter notebook which is
part of the Anaconda distribution that
is widely used these days even for our
demo in this video we'll be using
jupyter notebook I'll show you in a
while then we have the visual code
editor from Microsoft this is also one
of the preferred
Ides by Learners and companies
then we also have the popular text
editor called Sublime Text Editor
then we also have pycharm followed by
python ideally and spider as our top
Ides now let's look at the top companies
that are using python in our day-to-day
work
so we have Google quora Facebook even
Netflix Spotify and Instagram now there
are other top product based service
based and startups that also use Python
programming
so let's start as you all know python is
an interpreted language so you need to
install a python interpreter so for that
we'll go to the browser and search for
python.org
now we will move to the downloads page
and choose the latest version of python
to download and the latest version is
python 3.9.5
will click on the download
once the installer has downloaded open
it
now you can see the installation window
for python
you have to double check both the boxes
add python 3.9 to path
and click on install now
as the installation completes you can
see a screen that says the setup was
successful now click on close
now to check whether the python has been
installed successfully on the system or
not we will run a command on the command
prompt let's open the command prompt
click on start and write CMD
now to check whether the python is
installed or not we will run the command
python minus minus version
python space minus minus version and
press enter so here we can see that
python 3.9.5 version is installed in the
system so yeah python is working in the
system now we'll run some commands for
python so for that first we will type py
and press enter
and now we will write the basic command
that is
print
kit
hello world
semicolon and press enter
as you can see hello world is printed
here so yeah python is started working
in our system
now we will install libraries of python
we will be using pip to install numpy
sci-fi matplotlib and pandas library and
before installing the libraries make
sure the latest version of pip is
installed in your system so to check
that we will run a command in command
prompt
we will open the command prompt
and write a Command Web space minus
minus version
and press enter
as you can see the PIP version is 21.1.1
and it's being downloaded with the
python 3.9 so it's the latest version we
have downloaded
so now
we have to keep one thing in mind before
installing scipy matte protlip and
pandas Library first we need to install
numpy Library
so for that we will run a command
pip space
install
numpy and press enter
depending on your internet speed it will
get installed
as you can see the numpy library has
been installed and there's a warning
that our pip version is 21.1.1 and we
should upgrade it to 21.1.2 that is the
latest version available so we'll
upgrade the PIP version for that we'll
write a command python
space minus m space pip space install
space minus
upgrade space whip enter
okay so we made a mistake here in the
command so the mistake is we have
written only one minus sign before the
upgrade we have to write 2 minus signs
before the upgrade so we'll write the
command again python
space minus m space WIP space install
space minus minus upgrade
space pip and then press enter
and now depending on your internet speed
the PIP version the latest version will
be installed on your system
as you can see they have uninstalled the
paper version 21.1 and they have
installed
the latest version that is 21.1.2
we have installed the first library that
is numpy and that's the basic
requirement
for the installation of scipy Library so
now we will install the scipy library
so for that we will write the command
pip install scipy
with space
install
space sci-fi and press enter
and depending on your internet speed it
will be downloaded
now you can see that the Sci-Fi library
has been installed successfully and here
you can see that the requirement already
satisfied numpy so we have firstly
downloaded the numpy library so that we
can easily run the scipy library now we
will download and install pandas library
for that we will write the command
fifth space install
pandas
and press enter
and this will also install depending on
your internet speed
we can see that the pandas library has
been successfully installed now we are
left with matplot lib Library so now we
will install that for that we'll write
the command
pip space install
met
float live and press enter
as we can see the matplotlib liability
has been successfully installed
now we have installed all the four
libraries
so if you want to check whether the
library is installed on your system or
not
you can write a command to check that
first you have to write Python and press
enter
first we will check for numpy library
and for that we will create a array
for that we'll write the command
import
numpy
S and P and press enter
if you don't get any error it means that
the library has been installed
successfully so now we'll create an
array
a equal to NP Dot
array
1 comma 2 comma four
comma
5 comma 7 comma 9.
coma
D type
equal to we'll set it for float
press enter and we want to print this
array
right print
array
created
comma a
and press enter
you can see the output array created one
to four and five seven nine
so the numpy library is working fine so
we will check for other libraries for
that
we will write
import
space
mat.lib and press enter
if you don't get any error it means that
the library has been installed
successfully
so for the rest also we can
write the same commands import
pandas and press enter we do not get any
error so the library has been installed
successfully and we are left with sci-fi
so we'll write import space sci-fi and
press enter so here also we didn't get
any error so the library has also been
installed successfully
now we'll see what Anaconda is
Anaconda is a free and open source
distribution of python and our language
here we have conda which is a package
manager system similar to Pepin python
so now we will see how to download
Anaconda and then we will explore its
features
to download Anaconda first we will open
the browser
and search for the keyword Anaconda
we have to visit the official website
that is www dot anaconda.com
and now we will click on the product
section and choose the individual
Edition as it is open source Edition and
it is free of post
now we'll scroll down
here is the toolkit for the individual
Edition and will click on the download
on clicking the download we are directed
to the bottom of the web page and here
we can see the different versions
available for Windows that is 32 bit and
64-bit
we will download the 64-bit and it is of
size 477 MB so it will take ample amount
of time to download
we will download it
as the download completes click on the
application file
now click on next
the license agreement will appear now
click on I agree
then you have to select the installation
type if you want to install for a single
user click on just me and select for all
users and click on next I am installing
for me so I will click next
then it will ask for installation
location
after selecting location click on the
next
my from me the location is fine so I
will click next
then Advanced installation options will
appear if you have already installed
python on your system as we have
installed already so we do not have to
click on this section
you will only click on this section and
press install
it will take time to install
to the installation is complete click on
next
then click on next
and uncheck both these options and click
on finish
as you can see the installation has been
completed
now
we'll go to start and type Anaconda
we can see that Anaconda prompt and
Anaconda Navigator are visible
first we will open Anaconda Navigator
it's initializing and adding features
here you can see some pre-installed
applications and tools that are already
installed in the Anaconda and if you
want to install any other tool you can
like you can install ask Studio python
professional Orange 3 blue is in the
Anaconda
and you already have spider 2D console
Powershell from Jupiter notebook
Jupiter lab IBM motion Studio cloud data
lore cmd.exe prompt
so now we will open and open the prompt
now we'll see which version of conda is
installed in the system for that we'll
write a command conda space info
and press enter
here we can see that the Honda version
is 4.10.1
now we will launch Jupiter notebook for
that we will write the command
jupyter notebook
and press enter
you can see that the jupyter notebook
has initiated now create a folder where
you want to store the projects and
rename accordingly
so to create folder we'll create the
folder in OneDrive
sorry
I will create the folder on desktop
new
folder
we will click the Untitled folder and
rename it
and rename it as python one
now minimize the window
and
open the desktop
you can see that the python One
Directory is created and now we will
click on the python 1 folder
and
create a Python 3 notebook
as we have created a Python 3 file in
the jupyter notebook now we can run the
python commands on it
so we will run some commands and first
we'll run a basic command that would be
print
India
and we'll run this command window is
printed here now I'm going to run some
operators
like we will
print
7 into
8.
and then run so it's 56
and we'll also run an exponential
operator
print
to
exponent four
all right
so you can see 16 the result comes out
so now to save this file first we will
rename it
demo one
rename
and you will save it save and checkpoint
now you can check in the directory you
have created python one
that it is being saved as demo one
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to now miss an update
as you all know python is an interpreted
language so we require a python
interpreter to work up on while
installing python in our system we also
get python ideally automatically
installed but before writing a program
in Python ideally we will write a
program on command Pro
so for that first we will open command
prompt
we'll click on start and write CMD and
click enter
now the command prompt appears
first we will check the python version
pip space minus minus version
and press enter
you will see the python version 3.9
now
we'll start writing the Python program
for that first we have to write the
command py and press enter now we can
start writing a program we will write a
basic program on Division
for that we will assign a value 5
to a variable a
and
value 10 to the variable B
and we will divide B by a and we'll
print the value
of C
press enter
as you can see we have got an output 2.0
now we have run a program on command
prompt successfully now we will write a
program in Python ideally
so to write a program in Python idid we
will see some steps
first you have to open the python
ideally then click on file menu and
choose the new file and after writing
the program we have to save the program
with DOT py extension and then we can
click on the Run menu and then we will
see a run module and we have to click on
that
now we'll see it practically for that
we'll click on start
and search for idle
and now we'll click on python IDE
now we will follow the steps as we have
seen now
we'll click on file menu and choose new
file a new window will appear here we
will type the program to get two numbers
inserted by user and add them but before
writing this program let's understand
this program
so Python program on adding two numbers
first we have to get an end value
inserted in variably for that we will
write the command a equal to int around
brackets input around bracket started
for the message we have to put it in
inverted commas and first number colon
around bracket close and another round
bracket close
now we will insert an INT value in
variable B for that we will write the
command b equal to int round bracket
started input around bracket started for
the message we'll put the message in
inverted commas and the second number
colon
and then we will close this message by
round bracket and another round bracket
closing then we will assign a variable C
and add the operation a plus b for that
now we'll print
a message that would be addition of two
numbers equal to that would be an
inverted commas comma C as C variable
will store the result of a plus b
all the statements in the program will
get executed line by line now we will
execute this program on python ideally
for that we will write a program here
that would be a equal to
and
round bracket start input
round bracket
inverted commas
enter first number
inverted commas close
around bracket close
b equal to
end
input
round bracket started inverted commas go
message
enter second number
inverted commas round bracket goes
now we will assign the operation a plus
b in variable C for that we will write c
equal to a plus b
and now we'll print C
before executing this program we will
save this program file
save as
we will save it as demo one
and we will write the extension p y
and press save
as the program is saved now we will run
this program by click on this run menu
and then click on run module
you can see the program has been
executed now we will write the first
number that would be 10 press enter and
second number will write 6 and press
enter we will get 16 as an output
so we have executed the program on
python ideally
now we will see some best python IDs in
the market
for that
the best python IDs in the market are
Jupiter notebook Visual Studio code
Sublime Text pycharm
python ideally and spider notebook among
all these IDs we have worked with python
ideally now we will write a program in
jupyter Notebook
for that you have to install Jupiter
notebook I have installed Anaconda
distribution and it has python ID
already installed if you want to know
how to install Anaconda distribution go
and check the video in Python playlist
so let's open jupyter notebook for that
first we'll click on start
and write Jupiter notebook
and click on the jupyter notebook
Anaconda 3.
and will wait to get it started in a
browser
now we'll select the location where we
want to store the program
we will select the location in OneDrive
desktop
and I've created a python 1 folder there
so here we'll create a new Python 3
notebook
and name it as
first python
program
and now here we can start writing a
program
here we will write a program to multiply
three numbers
so for that we will get all the three
integers inserted by the users in three
variables and then we will operate the
operation multiplication
so for that we will write the command a
equal to end round bracket started
input round bracket and here we will
print the message
enter first number
colon
and then nautical Mass close and the
round bracket close now we will enter
another integer in variable B
for that we will write the command equal
to end
round bracket
input
down bracket started inverted commas
enter second number
colon
and then we'll close the inverted commas
and the round brackets
and now we will get the third interior
inputted by the user in variable C for
that we'll write the command c equal to
int round brackets input round brackets
inverted commas
enter
third number
colon inverted commas close and round
Bucket close now we will assign the
operation of multiplication in variable
d that would be by the command D equal
to
a
into B into C
now we'll print the variability
and for that we'll also print the
message
multiplication of three numbers
and close the inverted commas and then
we will insert a comma and then write
the variable d as D contains the output
of a into B into C now we'll click on
the Run command
and now we will
enter a first number that would be 5
and press enter then the second number
four then the third number six and then
press enter
and then we will get the output of
multiplication of three numbers as 120.
now we have successfully run the program
on jupyter Notebook
so in Python every value
has a certain data type
the variables in Python hold an object
of a particular data type since
everything is an object in Python data
types are actually classes and variables
and instances of these classes
now there are various data types in
Python
first we have the numeric types which
are essentially numbers so under numeric
types we have integers floating Point
numbers and complex numbers
then we have text type data which are in
the form of strings
the third type of data that is available
in Python are called as sequence types
which consists of less tuples and range
we have already seen about lists and
tuples in our previous video
and in Python we also have dictionary
objects as mapping data types in the
previous video you saw how to map key
value pairs using dictionaries
next
we have set data type now sets are
unordered collection of unique items
python also supports Boolean data types
and finally we have binary types of data
which include bytes byte array and
memory View
now let's head over to the jupyter
notebook where we will learn about these
data types in detail so here I am on my
jupyter notebook and I have titled my
notebook as data types in Python Recs
for recording so let's first start with
numeric data types
I'll give a comment using
a hashtag
I'll write
numeric data type
okay
let me Define a variable called num
in which I'll store a value of 7.
now
let me go ahead and print
the data type of
my variable num so for that I'm using my
function as type
if I
run this using shift plus enter you can
see here it tells me that
num variable is holding a value of type
integer
now you can also
use a print statement
I can write something like print
num
comma
I can give a message as ease of
type
I'll give another comma and then I'll
use my function type of
num
let's see the output
you can see it here
it
first
gets the value that is stored in the
variable num so 7
is of type and then it prints the
classes of type class integer
all right
I've just increased my
size of the notebook
next
let's declare
the same variable num and this time
we'll store the value as let's say 10.8
now you can see here there's a point
which means this is a decimal
or a floating value if you can check the
type of num it gives us
num is holding a value of type float
now let's say
I'll take a negative number let's say
minus 10.8 and we'll see the
type of
num
again minus 10.8 is also of type float
now let's say I'll declare
a complex variable let's say 8 plus 6 J
now this is the complex number
which is again of type
numeric data type
if I want to check the
data type of num it gives me complex
because 8 plus 6 J is of
complex data type
okay
now if you want to extract the real and
the imaginary parts of a complex number
you can do it something like this you
need to pass in the variable name
followed by a DOT and
the attribute name is real to extract
the
real part of the complex number if I run
this you can see here it has written the
real part of the complex number which is
8. now if you want to print the
imaginary part you can use num Dot
imeg which is for Imaginary if I run
this there you go it gives us the
imaginary part which is 6.
okay
now in Python you can also perform
conversion of data types so you can
convert between different data types by
using type conversion functions such as
end float Str
Etc
so let me Define a variable called num
which has a value 7.8
now
what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a variable called B
which is going to store the
integer part of num which means
initially I had defined number 7.8 which
is a floating Point number I want to
convert this num to integer type now
and
let me go ahead and
print
my B and I also print
the type of num
and
I'll then print
the type
B
let's run this and see the result okay
so if you see here clearly
when I see
print P it has written me 7 which is of
type integer so it has truncated the
decimal part
present in 7.8
again if I print type of num so num is
holding 7.8 it is of type float now
after converting the float value into
integer it has given me int
okay
similarly
let's say we have another number
minus 90.5
and
if I were to check the
type
I would write print type of num
then
let's convert
this to integer
so I'll write print in top num let's see
the results okay so initially minus 90.5
is of type float after we converted
our num to integer it gives us minus 90
so it has truncated the decimal point
part
all right
now let's see I'll create another
variable let's say c equal to
let's say I'll write float
of
B
now if you remember
our B holds a value of 7 if I were to
convert B to float again
I can use the float type conversion
function
and let's go ahead and print C
if I run this you can see here
previously B was holding an integer of 7
now it has converted that integer into a
float value so it is 7.0 now
okay
now moving ahead
let's see
about
Boolean data types
so if I have a variable let's say
r equal to
let's say it has a value called true
which is a type of Boolean value
and let me go ahead and print
the type of r
it gives me Boolean
now let's say I'll write num greater
than C
let's
go to the Top If you see here
num is holding a value of minus 90.5
and my C is holding a value of 7.0 I am
checking if num is greater than C if I
run this it gives me false because
minus 90.5 is less than 7.0 and not
greater than 7.0
suppose
I create a variable Boolean or B Double
L
and I'll store that value num greater
than C
and let's
print
the type of Boolean
I'll use type
of my variable That is bull
let's run it you can see it here it
tells us that
this particular operation is now holding
a data type of Boolean
if you are getting confused we can
change the
variable here let's see I'll write
B underscore bull
and similarly I'll write here B
underscore Bool let's run it
you get the same thing
all right
now moving ahead
let's explore how
string data types work in Python
I'll give a comment as
string data types
scroll down okay
so string data types or string values in
Python are
passed Within quotations suppose I have
a string called str1 and it has a value
let's say
Python Programming so this is a text
value
I have another string let's say str2
which has a value
let's say simply learn
now
let's run this
okay
now if I were to check
the type of str1
it should give me string so Str here is
a string
now you can also perform extraction
operations from the stream suppose you
want to extract
the value that is present in my first
ring that is str1 at index number 5.
let's run it
okay there is some error here okay so
this should be str1 and not strl
let's run it again
it returns us n
now let's count what is present at the
fifth index so from our previous
introduction to python video you might
be aware that in Python the index number
starts with 0 so if you count
p is at index 0
y is at index 1 T is at index 2 H is at
index 3
o is at index 4 and then
n is at index 5 so hence Str one of five
returns and
similarly if you can
check for
other string that is string two let's
say I want to see the value that is
present
at minus 4.
let's run it
it gives us e
now if you use a negative indexing
operation it will start counting from
the backward position so here n is at
minus 1 R is at minus 2 then you have a
at minus 3 and E is present at minus
four so hence str2 of minus 4 returns e
cool
now you can also perform slicing
operation suppose
I write str1
I want everything that is present
between the zeroth index to
the fifth index
I'll run it
it gives me
pytho so if you check
in string 1
it will start counting from the zeroth
index and go up to
the fourth index and exclude the fifth
index so in my string one if I start
counting from the zeroth index so it is
0 1 2 3 and 4 so it will
print from P till o
and that's the result
okay
now you can also use some inbuilt
functions with string suppose I write
str2
Dot
find
so I want to find the index where my
m is in simply learn
so I'll
write M within quotations and print it
it returns me 2.
if you check again
so s is at zeroth index 1 is at the
first index and M is present at the
second index
okay
moving ahead
let's explore a few sequence data types
so we'll start with
list data type
okay
now
first of all let me go ahead and
declare a variable called split one
equal to
and this will have some
text let's say this
is
Orange
then
I'm going to create another variable
called L1
equal to
I am going to
split
my variable or my string that is split
one using the split function
and I am going to split using the comma
so you can see here my string has comma
I'm going to separate each of these
words with a comma
and let's print L1
if I run this you can see it here
initially my split one was of type
string
and now we have converted split 1 to a
list you can see this this is a list and
it is present inside square brackets
verify you can use the type function so
I'll write type of
split one
it should return string you can see it
here SDR and now if I write
type of L1
it gives me a list
okay
now let's see a few more examples I'll
create another list called list one and
let's see it has some values
the alphabet a
we have
the number one which is in terms of
string again because I have passed in in
quotes
let's say I have India
let's make it consistent with single
quotations
and
let me
print what is inside list one
if I run it I get my list
now you can check the data type
if I write type of list one it gives me
it is a type list
now you can also perform certain
operations on list suppose you want to
add a few elements to your original list
for that I'm going to create another
variable called list two
and let's say list 2 has some values
let's say B comma 2
now
if I write
list 1
Plus
equal to
list 2.
and let me go ahead and
print
list one
let's see the result
there you go so our initial list had
three elements A1 and India and now we
have merged or concatenated two more
elements B and 2 and hence this becomes
our final list
okay
now moving ahead let's see one more
sequence data type that is Tuple or
Tuple
Now list 10 tuples we have already
covered in our previous video on
introduction to python if you need to
brush up what list and tuples are you
can check the previous video
so I'm going to create a tuple that is
top one and I'm going to
store some values
Tuple you can create using braces
I have some value let's say e b
C
d
and let's say e
or let's just restrict it to D
now you can check the type of top one
you can see here top one is of type
Tuple
now
I'll create another Tuple let's say tup2
and
it has some values let's say e
f
and let's say G
now
if I write
tup1
Plus
equal to dup2
and if I print
my tup1
I get the result
of a merged
Tuple
which has values of both qp1 and tup2
you can see here our original Tuple had
ABCD and then we merged the second Tuple
and it has
and it has given us EFG as well and
hence this becomes the final Tuple
you can also perform some basic
operations on Tuple let's see I'll write
dup1 multiplied by 2.
you can see the result here
it has printed
my original Tuple twice
okay
now moving ahead
let's see our mapping data type
that is dictionary
again dictionary is also covered
in our previous
introduction to python video
you can also have a look at that video
now the way to declare a dictionary
is
I'll create a variable dict one
and dictionaries are
written using curly braces and have key
value peers
so I'll write my first key as 1 and
let's say
this dictionary is about animals
and I have let's say lion
as my first animal in the dictionary
then I'll create my second key
let's see the second Animal I Have Is
tiger
and let's say
my third element
is
a dog
let me run it
and print
my dictionary you can see this
we have the dictionary printed
now if you want to check the type you
can write type of
dict1
it returns us dict which means
dictionary
you can also print the length of
dict1
and it gives us 3 which means our
dictionary has three elements
okay
now moving ahead
we'll explore
our set data type
now as we understood that sets are
unordered collections of
values
and these values are always unique
so I'll write set one let me give a
space
equal to
again sets are written within curly
braces
I'll create a set
let's say it has some duplicate entries
as well
and I'll print my set one
it returns only the unique values so it
has dropped
this 5 which was duplicated
you can check the type of set one
it gives us it is of type or the object
is of type set
now suppose
I have
another set called set 2
which has values let's say
a
comma
p
and let's say we have some numbers 3 and
4.
I'll tell you the operation that I'm
going to do
I'm actually going to
do an R operation
so I am going to print
set one
or
set
2 so this is an R operator in Python
let's print the results you can see here
it has printed
all the values that are present inside
set 1 or set 2. so in set 1 we have one
two three four and five and in set 2 We
Have A and P
so it has dropped 3 and 4 because these
are not unique and
3 and 4 are also presented set one
suppose I were to perform an and
operation
I'll write set one
Ampersand set 2.
if I run this
you can see here it has only printed
the unique values that are present in
both set 1 and set two so three and four
are the unique values and hence it has
printed three and four
let's say
I'll write set 1 minus set tool
let's see the results
it gives us only those values that are
present
in set 1
and are not present in set 2 which is
this
let's see the result if I write set 2
minus set 1.
so this will return the unique values
that are present in set 2 and are not
present in set one
so A and B are the unique values that
are present in set to hence it has
printed as a comma B
okay
now
another data type we had discussed was
range
so range is basically a function if I
write x equal to
range
4
and I'll print X it gives us from 0 till
4 because in Python the first index
starts from 0 and goes till 4 so the
range is from 0 to 4.
now you can also print that type of x
it returns us range
now
we'll see some binary data types
binary data types are not very often
used in Python but it is better if you
know
binary data types can be written as x
equal to B let's say I have a string
I'll write within double quotations
hello world
and let me go ahead and
print
my variable X
you see here
we have hello world
and now
let's print the type of X you see here
this is a binary type which is bytes
I'll show you another operation let's
say you want to extract a specific
value
from a particular index
from this binary data
so again you can use the indexing
operation
suppose I write print
I want to extract the value present at
the fourth index
it gives me one one one now this is very
interesting let's
deep dive into this
let's check
what is present at the fourth index of
my string
so H is present at the zeroth index E is
at the first index L is at the second
index the second L is at the third index
and we have o
at the fourth index
so
when we are trying to print the index
position it is actually returning us the
ASCII value of small o now here I have a
dock open which is from IBM
documentation if you see
the
ASCII value of small o or lowercase o
you will find that the ASCII value is
one one one and hence it has written
does one one
let's try for
another
index number let's say I want to find
the value which is present at index
number
minus
2 and if I run it it gives me 108
so minus 2 means it will start from the
last index
so minus 1 is D and minus 2 is L let's
see what is the ASCII value of L
if you see it here the ASCII value of L
is 108.
and hence it has written as 108
so this is how the binary data types
work in Python
now let's convert some
sequence objects to other type of
objects let's say I have a string
called s which has
something like
messy is from
Argentina
now you can check
the type of s fair enough it tells us
that Messi is from Argentina is of type
string
now
what I'm going to do is I'll use my list
function and pass in my variable that is
s so that it converts s to a list and
let me go ahead and print my l
you can see here my string s has now
been converted into a list and this is
the result
see here these are all
list elements present inside square
brackets
now if you want you can check the type
of file
it should return us
list
and you can see it here
now suppose
I have
another list let's say L1 which has
some
numbers let's say
1 15 3 6 0 8 4 and 3.
Let's see we also have one
okay so this is a list you can check
type of L1
fair enough it tells us that this is a
list
now I want to convert this list L1 to a
set
now as we know that set only contains
unordered unique elements
so if I write s equal to
I'll use the set function and then I'll
pass in my list variable that is L1
and let's print as
it only returns me the unique values
present in the list so it has dropped
the duplicate elements such as 3 and 1.
I can check the type
of s it gives us set
okay so that brings us to the end of
this demo session on
data types in Python let me go to the
top and
I'll brief you what we did in this demo
so first we looked at the different
numeric data types so we saw integer
data type then we saw floating data type
we also had complex data types we saw
how to extract a real part in imaginary
part from a complex number
then we used
some type conversion functions to
convert the numeric data types from one
data type to another so here we
converted a floating type data to an
integer type data
similarly
we saw how to use Boolean data types
then we saw about string data types we
also performed some basic operations of
using indexing method to extract
different values
we also saw how you can use slicing to
extract a range of values from your
string use the find function to find the
index of a particular
character in the string
then we learned the important sequence
data types like list
then we had tuples
and then we learned about mapping data
types such as dictionary
we also looked at set data type
now
later on we explored about range data
type and we looked at binary data types
we saw how binary data type returns
ASCII value of a certain character
finally we converted strings to list and
then we saw how to convert
list of sets if you're an aspiring
machine learning engineer looking for
online training and certifications from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simplyness professional
certification program in Ai and machine
learning from Purdue University that is
in collaboration with IBM should be a
right choice for more details you can
use the link provided in the description
box below in this video we will learn
about variables in Python but before I
begin make sure to subscribe to the
simply learn channel for interesting
Tech videos now let's get started
so in this video
we will learn what is a variable in
Python then
will understand what are object
references
we'll also see the different rules for
python variables and finally
will understand variables in detail with
Hands-On demonstration on The jupyter
Notebook
so variables in Python hold an object of
a particular data type
python variables are continuous for
storing data values we do not need to
declare variables before using them or
declare that data type like we do in
other programming languages such as Java
or C plus
python is not statically typed a
variable is created the moment we assign
a value to it
a variable is a name given to a memory
location
so here we can see
we have a variable called car and it has
a value called BMW now this value is of
type string since it is written within
double quotes
variables can have values of multiple
data types
now python also allows you to assign
values to multiple variables in one line
so here you can see I have assigned x y
z to Audi BMW and Mercedes in one single
line
all right
now let's look at object references in
Python
a python variable is a symbolic name
that is a reference or pointer to an
object
once an object is assigned to a variable
you can refer to the object by that name
so here we are assigning an integer
value of 50 to the variable a so
assignment creates an integer object
with a value of 50 and assigns the
variable A to point to that object as
you can see here so a is the variable
and it is pointing to the object that
has 50 value
now let's see another example so in this
case we have assigned
a variable a which has a value of 50 and
then we have created another variable
called B that has the value stored in a
python does not create another object in
this case it creates a new symbolic name
or reference called P which points to
the same object that a points to so here
you can see
both A and B are pointing to the same
object that is 50.
okay now
in this example
python creates a new integer object with
a value of 100 and B becomes a reference
to it we will explore all of these in
our demo
now
there are some rules for python
variables let me just read all the and
we will explore all these rules in our
demo session
so first a variable name must start with
a letter or the underscore character
a variable name cannot start with a
number
a variable name can contain only
alphanumeric characters or underscores
so you can see from A to Z 0 to 9 or
just underscore
the variable names are case sensitive so
here you can see I have written date
in three different types and these
are read as different variables and not
the same variable
and then there are several techniques to
write multi-word variables you have the
camel case you have the Pascal case and
we have the snake case don't worry about
it we'll explore these in the demo now
let me take you to my jupyter notebook
where we will understand variables in
detail
okay so I am on my jupyter notebook and
I have my title as variables in Python
so let's start
with my first variable let's say I have
a variable called a
and I'm assigning
50 to it
now you must be aware fifties of type
integer
so this a variable is now
holding an integer value
now if you want you can just print a
if I hit shift enter it will give me the
value of 50
now to check the data type of a you can
use the type function now if you have
covered data types and Detail in our
previous video if you want you can have
a look at it
so I will write type of a if I hit shift
enter it gives me the integer type
okay
now
let me show you another function called
ID if I write ID of a
let's run it it gives me a number this
is a long number now the ID function in
Python returns a unique ID for the
specified object so here object is a
so all objects in Python have its own
unique ID the ID is assigned to the
object when it is created
now what if
I assign
100 to e this time and let's see
the ID of a
if I run it you can see here the values
are different than the previous one
so every time the ID function will
return a unique ID for the specified
object
all right
now we learned in our Theory section
that you can assign multiple variables
in a single line now let me show you how
to do it
suppose
I'll write X comma y commas C so these
are the three variables and I want to
assign
three values to them so let's say x will
have 50
in y I want to store let's say 100 and
68.6
and
my Z
will have
a string or a text value let's say
simply learn
all right
let's run it okay now you can print them
one by one you can see here x has 50
y has 168.6 and Z has simply learn of
type
text you can check the
data types if you want let's say I want
to check the data type of Y
it gives me a float because
68.6 is a float
you can check the data type of
Z it is of type string
okay now you can also perform the same
operation of assigning multiple
variables in a single line in another
way let me show you how to do it
suppose I want to assign
the same
value to three different variables let's
say I want to assign the value of 10 to
X Y and Z so I'll write
x equal to y equal to Z equal to
I'll write 10.
if I run it
and let me print them one by one you can
see here x is 10 Y is 10 and Z is also
10.
now there is another way to do it that
is
I'll pass in my variables X comma y
comma Z
and then
I can write 10 comma 10 comma 10.
this will return the same result
okay
now let's look at the
rules for writing variable names
so these rules we had discussed in the
PPT section
now we'll explore them one by one
so the first rule is a variable name
must start with a letter or the
underscore character
so
let me just give a comment first rules
for
variable
naming
so the first rule says a variable name
must start with a letter or the
underscore character so if I write let's
say
some random variable in ABC equal to 100
this is valid you can print it
ABC it gives me hundred
now
you can also write the variable Limas e
followed by any number
it should be integer number if I write 1
0 2 equal to let's say this time I'll
give a string let's say India
and let me print it
it works perfectly fine
now we also said the name must start
with an underscore
I can start with an underscore and then
write let's say one two three
is equal to 70.5
now let me print it
now this works as well so you can start
your variable name with an underscore
followed by a letter or numbers
let me show you another example this
time I follow the underscore with
letters let's say
dog
I'll just give
any random dog name let's say I have a
dog called puppy
and let's say I'll print it
this also works okay
now you can have multiple underscores in
your name as well suppose I'll write
underscore
name underscore each
this is my variable name I'll write
let's say
Stuart
36
and let me print it
I wrote underscore name underscore each
this is also a valid variable name so
you can have multiple underscores in
your variable name
now
the next rule is a variable name cannot
start with a number
so if I write
let's say 4
name equal to
okay
and if I try to print it
it will throw an error so you cannot
have a variable name starting with a
number
all right
now
let me scroll down
the next rule is a variable name can
only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores so if I write at the rate
then let's say
each
equal to
40. if I run this it throws me an error
because at the rate is not recognized
and it is not a valid variable name
similarly let's say I'll write name
dollar
each
equal to let's say 40.
again this is not recognized dollar you
cannot use it in a variable name
the next rule is
variable names are case sensitive
so suppose I have a variable called car
which is all in lower case and
my car has a value let's say BMW
now if I were to print car it gives me
BMW
suppose I have another variable which
starts with a capital letter C followed
by lowercase ER
if I were to assign
CR 2 let's say Tata
and I printed
it returns me Tata and not BMW so you
should keep in mind that variable names
are case sensitive
similarly I can also have a variable in
all Upper Keys let's say
my
car is of Toyota brand
I made a spelling mistake
okay now if I print car
it gives me Toyota
so
these are the different
types of using case sensitive variables
now another important thing to note is
in Python Reserve words cannot be used
as a variable name
so let me open a new tab and here you
will search for
Reserve
keywords
in Python
let me open this link
or any other link for your reference
you see here
these are all
your keywords in Python and these cannot
be used as variable names let's try
using a few of them let's say I use
break
let's assign
a value to variable break equal to let's
say
60 if I run it it gives me an error
invalid syntax break you can't use
similarly let's use
another keyword let's say I'll use for
this time we have a keyword
called for you can see it here
suppose I write
for
equal to
I have let's say Virat
if I run this it throws me an error
again
let's try one more keyword
do we have try as a keyword yes we have
you can see here try is a keyword
if I write try equal to
any random value I'll pick this time I
am giving a floating number let's say
140.5 if I run it again it throws me a
error but you can use
an underscore and then
you can give that keyword let's say try
I'll assign the same value
and let's say we'll print it this will
work fine since
the variable name is no more a keyword
because we have an underscore
in the beginning
okay
now let me show you some
basic operations that you can perform
on python variables let's say we have a
equal to 100 and let's say b equal to
200
you can assign
an operation to another variable called
result let's say I want
the operation to be an addition
operation
and let's go ahead and print result
you can see it has given us 300 because
in result we are storing the addition of
A and B so 100 plus 200 is 300.
now similarly
you can perform
many operations like let's say this time
will perform a subtraction operation
so this time I am storing
a minus p in result and let's go ahead
and print result you can see here 100
minus 200 is minus 100.
then you can also have
let's say result equal to a by B
and let's print it
fair enough we have 0.5 because 100
divided by 200 is 0.5 similarly you can
also have integer division suppose I
write 100
divided by
say 40
and I'll print the result you see here
it has given us 2.5 but what if I want
to perform an integer division so I'll
add one more forward slash here and
let's run it it gives me only two so it
has truncated the 0.5
okay
now moving ahead
let's say I have a variable called
country
and
I have
India in it
so country is my
variable name and it is pointing to the
object that has
India has the value
I can print the
variable
you see here I have India and now if you
want you can perform some
extraction operation
suppose if I write country
within square brackets if I write
3
it gives me the character that is
present at the third index so I is
present at the zeroth index n is at the
first index D is at the second index and
I is at the third index let's say I want
everything that is present
until the third index it gives me IND
so this 3 is exclusive it will only
return us
the values present at the zeroth index
the first index and the second index
okay
now let me show you another interesting
example suppose I have a list that is
called cars and I have a list of
car names
let's say I have
BMW
then I have
Ferrari
and let's say
I have Toyota
I'll run it and I'll print my list that
is cars you can see here there are three
car names
and now what if I want to
put each of these car names in different
variables so I can write X comma y comma
Z and
I'll write equal to cars if I run this
now what it will do is it will assign
each of these values to
X Y and Z respectively now if you want
to print X you can see here x has BMW
then y has Ferrari and Z has Toyota
so this is another way to assign
values to variables
from a list
okay
no
you can also
use variables in the print
function or the print statement suppose
I write X
equal to let's say it has simply loan
now
I can print a message let's say
welcome
to
give a space
close the quotations
do a plus sign and I'll give the
variable name
if I
run it you can see here the message is
printed welcome to and the X which has
the value of Simply loan so welcome to
Simply loan
okay
now another thing to note in Python is
that you cannot add an integer and a
string suppose I have X as the variable
and it has a value let's say 20. and
then I have Y which has
the string simply learn
now string can be put in double quotes
or in single quotes you can use
whichever way you want
suppose I print
X Plus y
let's see the result it gives us an
error so you cannot
print
or add an integer and a string so you
need to convert one of these values
now there are several techniques to
write multi-words variables you can use
the camel keys to write multiple
variables
so here each word except the first
starts with a capital letter
so I'll just give a comment here and
write
camel case
and
the way to write is
apart from the
first word
all the words
start with the capital letter
suppose I write my department equal to
marketing
so here
the first word my
the M starts with a small letter while
the second word Department the D starts
in a capital letter so this is an
example of a camel keys
Phi
want to print it I can write my
department
run it it gives me marketing let's see
another example I have let's say car
brand
so you see here
car brand are two words
but
the first word starts with a
small letter while the second word has
an uppercase B
let's say my car brand is Hyundai
you can print it
there you go all right
moving ahead
we also have Pascal case where each word
starts with a capital letter
suppose I have a variable called my name
is
let's say Nathan here you can see my and
Nema two different words and both the
words start with a capital letter so
this is an example of Pascal case
if I run it
let me just print it first okay you see
here I have my name similarly let's say
we have another Pascal case multi-word
variable which is each now where age has
a caps and now has n caps so this is
also an example of a pascal case
variable let's say my age now equal to
30 I'll print each now
it returns me
30. now one thing to note here is if I
write let's say each now
if I do this it gives me an error
because your variables names are case
sensitive so we haven't created any
variable which has small a and small n
in each now
okay
now the third way to write a multi-word
variable is called as snake case
so if you want I can
give a comment saying sneak case
so here each word is separated by an
underscore character
so let's say I have a multi-word
variable which is City underscore
address
and let's say the city is
New York
now if I print it
you have New York so this is an example
of a snake case where
each word has a underscore in between
you can have multiple underscore between
each word suppose I write my
current
each
equal to 35 let's say
so I have
my current each
I run it
okay there is some mistake here I have
missed an R you see here it says 35 so
this is also an example of a snake case
where each word is separated by an
underscore so here we have two
underscores
all right now let me go to the top and
let me brief you what we did so first we
so and
integer value variable
we saw how you can check the
data type of the variable using the type
function then we explore about the ID
function
we saw how you can
pass in
variables or multiple variables in a
single line
then
we saw how you can assign the same value
to three variables in one line
now this is another method to do the
same operation
now then we looked at the
different rules for naming variables
your variables can start only with a
letter or an underscore
and that letter can be followed up with
numbers as well and you can have
similarly numbers after
underscore you can also have characters
after underscore
you can have multiple underscores
but your variable name cannot start with
a number
and it cannot have special characters
like at the rate or
dollar symbol
these will throw an error
you can see your variable names are case
sensitive so here we defined car in
three different ways
and all the three
give us different results
another important thing we saw was
you cannot use
keywords python keywords as variable
names we saw brick for and try
now we perform some
basic mathematical operations we also
saw how you can perform some extraction
operation using string values in Python
then we saw another way to assign the
values of a list to different variables
we saw how you can use the variable name
in a print statement
then we saw how
you cannot add an integer
with a string
we explored the camel case then we saw
how you can
write multi-word variable using Pascal
case and finally we looked at
snake case
in this video we will look at python
object types and type conversion
objects are the most fundamental Concept
in Python Programming so we are going to
learn the built-in objects that python
provides
so now let's see the agenda for today so
we are going to talk about object types
in Python then we'll see the different
type conversion functions that are
available in Python
then we see the different types of type
conversion
all right
now let's look at the different types of
objects in Python
so we have list you have tuples numbers
strings dictionaries sets you even have
file objects then you can see we also
have other code types such as Boolean
and none
then we have program unit types like
functions modules and classes
now we will touch upon most of them in
the demo section of this tutorial then
we also have implemented related types
all right
now let's see how you can convert one
data type to another using type
conversion
so python provides two types of data
conversion techniques one is called the
implicit type conversion and the other
is called the explicit type conversion
now in implicit data type conversion
python can automatically convert one
data type to another data type this
process does not need any user
involvement
while in external conversions
users convert the data type of an object
to require data type by using predefined
functions that are listed here so you
can see here we have the different
functions so if you want to convert a
specific value to an integer you can use
the int function we have the float
function
now we have something called this ORD so
the ORD function accepts a string of
unit length as an argument and Returns
the Unicode equivalence of the past
argument now we also have hex and OCT so
the hex function
is used to convert an integer number to
its corresponding hexadecimal value
similarly the oct function will convert
the corresponding
or let's say We'll convert an integer
number to its corresponding OCTA decimal
value
we have double list set dictionary Str
is for string you can convert a number
into a complex number by providing its
real and imaginary part now we also have
this CHR or the character function
now this is how the basic General syntax
looks like you have the required data
type followed by the expression
okay
so let's head over to our jupyter
notebook and learn the different types
of objects as well as look at the type
conversions in Python
okay so here I am on my jupyter notebook
let's first look at
number objects so I'm giving a
comment
as number objects all right let's see I
have a variable called num
which is equal to let's say 2.
now
is very simple that 2 is an integer
so if you want to check the type
you can just use the type function and
it gives us int which means integer so
here 2 is of
a type called number object
let's say you want to pass a floating
value
let's say 2.2
see the results
2.0 is of type float and again
2.0 or 2.0 is a number object
you can perform various operations on
number objects suppose you want to add a
few numbers
so let's say 321 Plus 365.
and I'll say add
it gives us the addition of these two
numbers which is 686.
now let's see
you want to
perform a multiplication operation
let's say 62 multiplied by 2.5
if I hit shift enter it gives me the
multiplication of the product of these
two numbers that is 55.0
now python by default will
convert the result to a floating Point
number if there is one integer and this
one float
if you want to return the exponent of a
number let's say I want to know 2 raised
to the power 4
so I'm using double asterisks to
represent the exponent operator
if I hit shift enter it gives us 16 so
it's basically
2 multiplied 4 times
now you can also
import specific libraries so let's say I
want to import the math library and I
want to print
the value of pi so here I have written
import math and then using the module
math I am
trying to find the value of pi let's run
it you see here it says 3.141 so on and
so forth
so you can also
import the random module let's say I'll
write input
random and then let's say I want to
print a random number
you can use the random Dot
random function let's run it you see
here this is a random value that python
has generated if I run it again this
value changes let's run it again again
this value changes
okay
now we'll shift our Focus to
understanding string objects in Python
so I'll give a comment string objects
let's say I have a string
a is equal to and let's say the string
has India
okay
now if you want you can print a it says
India
now suppose I want to
extract
the value that is present at the zeroth
index of the string so the way to do is
I'll pass in my variable name that is a
and within square brackets I'll give the
index value that is 0. now one thing to
remember in Python the index value
starts with 0 and not one so if I do
a of 0 it gives me I because I is
present at the 0th index now let's say I
want
the last value
in this string India so I need to return
a for that I can use negative indexing
by using minus 1. if I do minus 1 it
gives me a which is the element present
at the last index
now let's say
I'll write a 1 and colon
let's run it you see the result here it
says n d i a which means python has
returned everything starting from the
first index
till the last index so here colon means
you need to return everything that comes
after the first index
now let's say
I'll write
print
a
and I'll add
let's say x y z
let's run it
you see here this XYZ has been
concatenated with the value that was
present inside a that is India so the
result is India followed by XYZ
okay
now
if I write e multiplied by 7
it will print India seven times without
a space you can see it here
cool
now let's say you want to replace
certain values in the string you can use
the replace function so if I write a DOT
replace let's say I want to replace ie
that is present in India
with let's say
x y z
let's run it you see here
IND is fine after that we have I a and
that I a has been replaced by XYZ
now let's move on and understand
list objects in Python so I'll write
list objects
okay
let's go ahead and declare a list L1
within square brackets
let's say we have
values like 1 0 1
let's say America
and then let's say we have another
floating value let's say 2.05
okay
this is my list if you want to print the
list you can use
L1 to print it you see here this is my
list L1 now if you want to find the
length of L1 you can use the Len
function
if I run it
you get 3 which means there are three
elements in the list 101 America and
2.05
now if you want to extract certain
values from the list for that you can
use the indexing method let's say I'll
write
L1 of
1.
that gives me America because
at index position 1 we have America so
101 is at the zeroth index America is at
the first index and 2.05 is at the
second index
next
let's say I write L1
and then
I give colon -1 let's print it so that
gives me
101 in America so what it does is this
colon -1 will exclude the last index and
print the other two
elements in the list
okay
now if you want to append
some elements to the list you can use
the append method so I write L1 dot
append within brackets I'll give my
value let's say
USA
now let's go ahead and print L1
if I run it you can see the difference
earlier my list had three elements 101
America and 2.05 now we have added the
fourth element that is USA
cool
now you can also use the pop function in
python let's see what it does
so I write L1 dot pop and I'll give
let's say three
if I run it it returns me
USA because USA is present at the third
index of my list
if I write pop one
it gives me America because
America is present at the first index
all right now you can also reverse the
elements in a list if I write L1 Dot
reverse function
if I run this and then I'll
print L1
you see the result here we have 2.05 and
101 which is printed in reverse order
the reason being
we have already popped America and USA
out and we are only left with 101 and
205 and if we reverse the current list
it will be printed as follows so 2.05
comes at the beginning and then we have
one zero one
let me just
read on my list again to show you the
difference
I have run my L1
let's run this append query
and now let's use the reverse function
there you go so now our original list
has been reversed so you have USA at the
beginning and 101 towards the end
okay
now moving ahead let's see
the next type of object in Python that
is dictionaries
okay
let's say I'll create a dictionary
called dict1
and you might be aware that dictionaries
are created using the curly braces
so I'll have my key value pairs let's
say my key is 1 and the value it whole
says let's say
the names of animals
tiger
comma
will have the second key and that second
key will have the value let's say lion
and let's say we have another element
with the third key
and let's see we have
Mouse
okay
now
let's print our dictionary
so this is how
my dictionary looks like
now
you can display the keys
by using the keys function
so this will return all the keys present
in the dictionary you see here one two
and three are my keys similarly
you can display the values in the
dictionary
you need to change this keys to values
if I run it you see here tiger lion and
mouse are the three values
now suppose you want to add another
element to your dictionary for that you
can write dict1
and give the fourth key
equal to the value let's say that
now let's run
dict1 and see the difference
there you go so here we have added
another element to the dictionary which
is cat
now moving ahead let's explore
double objects
okay so we'll create a tuple called T1
equal to
we'll have the values 1 comma 2 comma 3
comma four
and let's say you want to print the
length of Tuple T1 it gives you 4
because we have four elements in the
Tuple T1
now let's say I'll declare
one more Tuple called T2 and this time
we'll have two more elements in the
Tuple so I'll write T1 Plus
followed by the two elements that I want
let's say seven comma 9 and I'll print
T2
if I run it you can see here we have
added 7 and 9 to our original Tuple that
had one comma 2 comma 3 comma four
now you can also use the indexing method
or the slicing technique to extract
values from the Tuple let's say I write
T2 of 3 it will return the third element
that is present in Tuple
T2 so if you see here
my
third index has the element 4 hence it
has returned 4.
cool
now moving ahead
let's see
how file objects work in Python
all right
Now using python you can create files
let's say I want to create a text file
in Python using the jupyter notebook for
that I can write F1 equal to
I'll use a function called open
and inside this open function I want to
create a text file and first
I'll write something into that file
let me show you so this is a folder that
I have
the folder name is called object types
and it is present in my desktop so I'll
use this location
and here you can see now this folder
contains no files as of now but we are
going to create text file using python
let's see how to do it
so here I'll paste my
location that I've just copied
now one thing to note is you need to
convert everything to
forward slash or you can use
double backslash also
I'll give another forward slash and
let's say I want to
create a file in the name of data.txt so
it is going to be a text file make sure
everything is
inside single quotation
and I want to open the file in
right mode so I'll write w here let's
run it and see the difference now if we
check our folder you see here earlier
there was no data file now we have
created a text file in the name of data
you see here there are no
information or data inside this text
file next we are going to add some data
to this text file
let's
go back to our jupyter notebook okay
so we'll write some data to that file so
I'll write F1 Dot
after that I'll use the write function
and within single quotations I'll write
let's say hello
simply learn
and then
I'll give backslash n to go to the next
line
I'll write again F1 dot right
and I'll pass in another message let's
say welcome to
python
programming
and we'll give another backslash
followed by n
and then finally we'll close the file so
I'll write F1 Dot
close function
let's run this
and we'll see the difference now
if I open this there you go we have some
data in this text file that is hello
simply loan welcome to Python
programming
so this is how file objects work in
python
all right
now moving ahead we'll see how
sets work in Python
suppose I create a set called s
and I'll use the set function
and I will pass in
India
so this is a string
and I want to convert the string to a
set
let's say I have another
set called S1
and here I have
a list of values let's say U
s
and let's say a
now if I write s comma
S1
so what set does is it will return only
the unique values that are present
inside each set so here if you see India
all the elements are unique except I
because I is repeated twice so it will
return I only once in the result but USA
has all the elements present only once
so
set will return all the elements
now what if I'll
write let's say s
am percent
S1
so
this will give me only the
common element that is present in both
the sets so if you see here in India and
in U S and E
only a is repeating in both the sets so
it gives me a
suppose I write
s
is the or operator and I'll write S1
if I run it it gives me
all the elements that are present inside
set s and S1
excluding the repeating elements so here
I is repeating so it has printed only
once
similarly you can write
s minus S1
so you get
only those elements that are present
inside
s and are not present in set S1
now in set s e is present as well as is
present in set S1 so it has excluded E
from the result
okay
now we'll see some operations let's say
I'll write equal to 7 and be equal to
let's say 2.2
I'll
add e and B and store the result in
my variable R which stands for result
let's see
the output if I write print
are
it gives me 9.0 and if I check
type of R it gives me
there's a spelling mistake I'll write
type of R it gives me float so here
python is performing implicit
type conversion so if you add an integer
with a floating Point number the result
will be a floating Point number and not
an integer
now if you
see equal to 7 and let's say b equal to
C 2.0
and this time I am explicitly defining
my result to be an integer so I am using
an integer function so if I write a
Plus
B
and if I print r you see the result it
has given me an integer which is 9. now
to verify you can also use
type of r
it gives me integer but earlier
it returned us float
so this is how
implicit and explicit conversion work in
Python
now this example was for numbers
similarly you can
also
perform for Strings
and for less tuples and sets
now moving ahead
one thing I wanted to tell you was you
cannot add a string and an integer
suppose
I'll give a comment string and integer
Edition
suppose I have a variable called e which
has a value of a 7 so 7 is an integer
here then I have a variable called P
which has a value 2 but this time I'll
assign this 2 Within
quotes So this becomes of type string
now if you want you can check that as
well if I write type of 2
rather type of P it will give us Str
which means string
now let's see
I'll write R which stands for result
equal to
a plus b
now if I print r
it will give us an error because you
cannot add a string with an integer so
it says unsupported operand
the way to fix this is you need to
convert this string into an integer
explicitly
so this time we'll say equal to 7
B
equal to
2 so it is a string
now I'll write r equal to
a plus I'm going to use the integer
function or the int function to convert
my B to an integer
and then I'll print R again let's do
this there you go so here we have
converted my string value to
a numeric value
of 2 and this time it works fine so 7
plus 2 is 9.
okay
now let's see how you can convert a
float value or a floating number into an
integer number let's say I have a
variable called a which has a value
let's say 77.9
and I'm going to create another variable
called int underscore e and I'll pass
this to my integer function
so it has int of a now let's print
int underscore e
so you have 77 so my integer function
has truncated the decimal point value
that had 0.9
if you want to check the type you can
use
type function I'll write type of
int underscore e
so it gives us integer
now you can also convert an integer to a
floating point value
so if I have a variable called a that
has a value of let's say
50
and if I write
float underscore a equal to I'll use the
float function to convert the variable e
to a floating point value
and let's print float underscore a so it
gives us
50.0 instead of 50. you can also check
the type
of float a
it gives you float
okay
now you can also convert an integer to a
complex number
let's say I'll take the same value equal
to 50 I'll write com P underscore e
which stands for complex e I'll use the
complex function
and pass in my
variable that is e
now let's print
comp underscore a
so it gives us
50.0 J so 50 is the real part and 0 J is
the imaginary part
you can also convert an
integer to a string
I'll take the same value let's say 50
I'll write Str underscore a equal to
Str of a so I'm using the string
function to convert my integer to a
string
let's print Str underscore e
it should be an underscore and not in
hyphen
let's run it there you go you have 50
within single quotes
you can also check the type of a
HTR underscore a it gives you string
cool
now
we learn how to convert a string to a
tuple
so let's say I have a string that has
India as its value
if I write TS equal to
I'll use the Tuple function and pass in
my variable that is s
and then we'll print TS
you can see here
python has converted my string s which
had India into a tuple of individual
elements and my Tuple is present inside
brackets
cool
now similarly you can convert a string
to a list
I'll use the same string as equal to
India
and then let's say I want to convert it
to a list I'll use L1 equal to
followed by the list function and inside
the list function I'll pass in my
variable that is s
and let's print L1 and see the
difference
you see here my string has now be
converted into a list you can also check
the data type of L1 or the object type
of L1 it returns you list
similarly you can also check the type of
TS
it gives you Tuple because we converted
that string to a tuple
now let's explore how you can convert a
tuple to a list let's say you have a
tuple called T and it has a list of
names let's say John
we have Mary
then we have let's say mark
now to convert into a list we'll use the
list function again let's say L2
equal to list of
t
and let's print L2
so this is a list because it is present
inside
square brackets
you can check the type of
t
so T is a tuple you see here if I change
this to L2
it gives you list
cool
now
moving to the next section where we'll
see how to convert
integer to binary
suppose I have a variable called a equal
to 10. and then
I have P equal to bin off a
let's say we have another variable which
is C
and here I want to convert my integer
into a
hexadecimal value or a octa decimal
value for that you can write D equal to
use the oct function for
OCTA decimal value
okay now we are going to print them one
by one so I'll write print of B
print of C
and then we'll print what is there
inside d
will run it and you can see the results
here
so binary of 10 you see here
hexadecimal of 10 you see the value here
this is an extra decimal value
then you have the OCTA decimal value of
a
okay
now moving to the final section of this
demo
you can convert a number to its
corresponding ASCII character
let me show you how to do it suppose I
have
N1 equal to
76.
now if I write
CHR of
N1 and run it it gives me l
now let's see our ASCII table so this is
my ASCII table and
for 76 you can see here the character is
l
so this CHR of N1 will return
the corresponding ASCII character for
that particular number so here 76
belongs to l let's say we have another
number N2 equal to let's say 100. now if
I write CHR of N2
and run it it gives me
lowercase D we'll see the table again
and if you see for 100 we have lowercase
D now here you have a list of characters
these are special characters you have
uppercase characters you have at the
rate you have numbers each of them have
their own ASCII values
cool
now
you can convert string character into
Unicode values now let me tell you what
Unicode value is so computers on a basic
level deal with numbers so letters that
appear on computers are stored by
computers as a list of numbers so the
Unicode standard provides a unique
number for every character and supports
multiple languages and all special
characters
so let's see I have a string s which has
the value of capital A or uppercase E if
I write R which stands for result equal
to ord so this is the function which
converts a string to a Unicode value
I'll write ORD of s and we'll print our
if I run it it gives me 65 so
65 is the Unicode value of a
you can also have digits let's say I
have seven
I'll run it so 55 is the unique code
value of the string 7.
let's try for any other letter let's see
V and run it you have 86 okay
so that brings us to the end of this
demo session if you are an inspiring
machine learning engineer looking for
online training and certification so
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simplyness professional
certification program in Ai and machine
learning from Purdue University that is
in collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details you can
use the link provided in the description
box below let's have a look at the
agenda for today
so we'll understand what is the string
in Python and how to create strings in
Python then we look at the different
string Methods and how to perform string
indexing and all these we'll see with
the help of Hands-On demonstrations on
The jupyter Notebook
so let's understand what is a string
so a string in Python is an object that
represents a sequence of characters
in Python we have Str as the data type
of string
now you can create strings
using single quotes or double quotes so
here is an example
where we have used a single code to
write a string so our string is hello
India which is inside a single code
below if you see we have the same string
written within double quotes so these
are the two methods in which you can
create strings in Python now you can
also use triple quotes which are
generally for multi-line Strings or dog
strings so here is an example we have a
string called str3 and the content it
has is human psychology is an
interesting subject now if you print the
string it will be printed in two lines
and not in a single line
now we'll be exploring much more in
detail in our demo session so please
wait for a while next we have string
indexing so if you want to extract a few
characters from your string you can use
the indexing method so in Python
a string starts with the index number 0
so here we have a string which is
healthy
and
the first element is present at the
zeroth index so at the bottom you see
the forward index on the top you have
the reverse index or the negative
indexes
so in python as I said the first index
is at the zeroth position so H is at 0 E
is at the first index a is at the second
index so on and so forth
now similarly if you look at negative
indexing it starts with minus 1 in
reverse order so we have minus 1
for y minus 2 for H minus 3 for T and so
on and so forth now let's head over to
our jupyter notebook where we'll learn
about strings in Python in detail
okay so I am on my jupyter notebook
first I'll create a
new notebook I'll click on new and then
select python 3.
okay
so here let me
rename my notebook as
strings in Python demo
I'll click on rename
okay
now let's start with our first example
I'll create a variable called str1 that
will have a string
you can see here I am using single
quotes now I'll write hi
Sam
so here
str1 is holding a string called high Sam
and let's go ahead and print the string
str1
I'll hit shift enter to run it you see
here I have my string print at high Sam
now if you want to check the
data type
that str1 holds you can use the type
function
and inside the type function I'll pass
in my variable str1 if I run it you see
here it gives us Str which means
it is of type string
now let's create another string str2
using double quotes this time so I'll
write let's say
hello
Angela
I can give exclamation mark
okay now let's just print the second
string you see here this is my second
string which is hello Angela if you want
you can also use the print function here
and run it you get hello Angela
now let's
write a multi-line string using triple
quotes so I'll write str3 equal to
I'll use triple quotes
and then
I'll say
hi everyone
go to the next line I'll write today
we will
learn about
I'll go to the next line and I'll write
strings in Python
then I'll again give triple quotes to
close my string
and let's just print this str3
if I run it you can see it here I have
now written a multi-line string hi
everyone today we will learn about
strings in Python let me just add a s
the Hugo okay
now coming to the next topic we'll learn
about indexing
all right
let me declare a string str1
which has
value as simply loan
now
to use indexing and extract certain
items in a string or values in a string
you can use square brackets and inside
the square brackets you can give the
index position
for example if I write str1
and in the square bracket I'll give
let's say I want to
find the element or the value present at
the zeroth index let's run it it gives
me S because as we learned in the slides
the first index in a string starts with
the zeroth number so I have S in my
zeroth index so hence it has printed s
let's explore a few more if I write str1
of let's say I want to know what is
present at the third index if I run it
it gives me P you can check now so s is
at the zeroth index I is at the first
index m is at the second index and P is
at the third index
let's see I'll write str1 of
let's say 12.
we can see the difference now it gives
us an error it says string index out of
range the reason being simply learn
does not have any value at the 12th
index so it's printing an error saying
string index out of range
now let's change this to
6 and see what we have at the sixth
index we have L if you count here
s is at the zeroth index I is at the
first index m is at the second Index P
is at the third index
the first L is at the fourth index again
I is at the fifth index and then we have
the second L at the sixth index so we
have L printed here
now let's see how to use
a slicing operator using colon I'll
write
slicing operator
okay
I'll use the same string str1 let me
print it once again we have simply learn
suppose I write str1
within brackets I'll use the slicing
technique now I want everything starting
from the zeroth index
I get simply learn so here I am printing
everything that starts with the zeroth
index
next let's see what we have if I print
my string str1
and write 1 is to 6. I'll run it it
gives me impli so if you notice here
I want to extract whatever is present
from the first index till the sixth
index but excluding the sixth index so
in Python
the indexing method or the slicing
method will exclude the last index so
here if you see I is at the first index
m is at the second Index P is at the
third index
L is at the fourth index and then we
have i at the fifth index and we have
excluded the sixth index that is the
second l so hence it has written us i m
p l i
now similarly let's say
we'll see another example I'll write
str1 this time I'll use colon 6.
if I run it you get
simply so it has printed everything
starting from the zeroth index till
the sixth index but excluding the cyst
index so you have all these values
from zeroth index till the fifth index
okay
now you can also reverse a string for
that you can use negative slicing using
two colons
if I write print
str1
and within square brackets I'll give
colon colon
-1
let's run and see the result
there you go if you see this it has
printed my original string which is
simply learning reverse order now
so this is a very simple method if
someone asks you to reverse a string or
print something in reverse order you can
use the negative slicing method
now let's explore a few more example if
I write str1
and within brackets I'll give
-1 and run it it returns me n because in
my original string if I go on the top I
have n at the last index which is here
minus 1.
similarly let's see what we have at
minus
3
we have a here if I go to the top
you see here
n is at minus 1 R is at minus 2 and a is
at minus 3 and hence it has given us a
thank you
now let's see I'll write str1
I want to print
-2
colon and let's see the result it has
given us R and n so here we are printing
only the
last two elements in the Stream hence we
have used minus 2.
okay
now
python does not allow you to reassign
values in a declared string let me show
you what I mean
I'll give a comment here
reassign
strings
suppose
I have the same string str1 which is
simply learn
say I write Str
and I want to replace
the value
present at the third index with let's
say
o
and
if I were to print
str1 now
python will throw an error saying Str
object does not support item assignment
so it is immutable like tuples where you
cannot reassign any values
you can also delete a string
say I have another string called str2
which has a value of
let's say Python programming
you can use the DL keyword
and write str2
and now let's print str2
you will see that it says name str2 is
not defined because we have already
deleted str2
the above step
okay
now let's go ahead and see some of the
important string operations
okay
say I have str1
which has python the one thing to note I
am using either single code or double
quote you can use whatever you want
let's say I have another string which
has programming
so these are my two strings
let's
perform a few operations on these
strings
see I write
str1
multiplied by 3.
and I'll run it
you can see here it has printed python
Thrice because I have said str1
multiplied by 3 so in str1 we have
Python and multiplying three returns
python three times
now let's see I'll write str1 Plus str1
it has merged python twice so I have
Python and python repeated
let's say I write str1 Plus str2
we'll see the result it gives us Python
Programming so basically
if you use
plus operator with two strings python
will perform a concatenation operation
which means it will merge both the
strings
now if you want to find if a specific
character is present in a string or not
you can use the in operator for this
let's say I'll print
whether
W is
present in
Str
1
to run it it gives us false because in
str1 we have Python and if you see here
we do not have the letter W in Python
and hence it has given us false let's
now let me copy this
I'll paste it here
let's try whether o is there in string 1
or not it gives us true because we have
an O here
you can see here we have an o
similarly
let's say I want to find whether
l e
is there in string 2 or not
but run it it gives us false because in
string 2 we have programming and we
don't have any l a
present in programming
let's say we'll see whether Ro is
present in string 2 or not
this time it returns us true because if
you see here we have Ro in programming
and hence it has given us
true
now you can also
print a raw string using the
R alphabet
so the way to write this I'll write r
give a
single quote
let's say I'll give a location C drive
to forward slash and let's say I'll
write
python 3.7
and run it it gives me a raw string
now
let's see some formatting methods I'll
write
a comment saying
format methods
okay
I'll write a print statement
I'll give double quotes and here
let's see the first example where I'm
using curly braces I'll write
and I'll give another curly braces
you'll get to know what I'm doing once I
finish this
let's say I have a message both are
best
friends
then I'm going to use my format
method
and inside this I'll pass in my two
values for these braces
so these curly braces will be replaced
by
the words that I pass in or the values
that I pass in within the format method
so here I'll write let's say
James
and my second person would be
Brad
now let me run it you see here
what python does is it replaces
the curly braces with
the names that I have passed within the
format method so it takes the first
argument for the first curly brace
and the second argument for the second
curly base
so my statement becomes
James and Brad
both are best friends
now let me just copy this I'll show you
another example
this time I'll
give one and zero inside the curly
braces
now if I run this
there you go
so here
James is at the zeroth index so this is
basically a list where James is at the
zeroth index and Brad is at the first
index so if I write 1 and 0 it will take
Brad here and then
for 0 it will take James so now my
message becomes Brad and James both are
best friends
now let's try out another example I'll
paste it here
I'll use
two variables let's say A and B
and inside my format method
I'll write a equal to James
and I'll assign b as Brad
let's run it there you go we have our
message printed James and Brad Buddha
best friends so here e refers to James
and P refers to bread
cool
let's explore another example
I have a variable called name and that
has a value
Angela
and then I have another variable
let's say salary
of
hundred thousand dollars
I'll use a print statement
I'll print a message her
name
is
I'll use
percentage s for string
give
a backslash n for next line and I'll
write
her
salary is
then I'll write
percentage T this is for numbers
and then I'll give another percentage
and let's see I'll write
my two variables Neiman salary
let's
see what we have in the result
I need to close my double quotes here
I'll exclude it from here let's run it
there you go
so I have my message here her name is
Angela her salary is
hundred thousand dollars
I'll just delete this piece here we'll
run it again okay
now this percentage s refers to the name
and we have declared her name is Angela
so my first statement or the message
Becomes Her name is Angela and the next
message is her salary is percentage T So
percentage T here refers to the salary
where we have hundred thousand
so the next message is her salary is
hundred thousand
so these are the very basic and
important print methods or formats that
you can use
while working with strings
now we'll explore a few
functions that are readily available in
Python to operate with strings
I'll take my same string str1 as simply
loan
and then
I'll create another variable called str2
I'll write str1 Dot I'm going to use the
capitalize method
okay
let me make one correction I'm going to
write everything in lower case so that
we can see the difference how we can
capitalize the string
so I'll write my print statement print
old value
this is going to my message
I'll give a colon
followed by my double quotes and I'll
pass in my variable str1
okay
now I'll copy this
in the next line we have
a new value as str2
let's run it and see the difference
there you go so here my old value has
simply learned in all lower case but
when I used the capitalize method
so python has converted my first letter
in simply learn to Upper Keys or Capital
keys
cool
now let me copy this
I'm going to use the same example for
the next three methods
let me show you how the case fold method
works this time I'm going to pass my
input string in all upper case I'll
write simply learn in upper case
and instead of capitalize I'll write
case fold
let's run it and see the difference
there you go
initially we had simply learn in
Upper Keys and now we have converted
into case fold so all the letters are in
lowercase
now moving ahead
you can also use the
upper method to convert a string into
Upper Keys let's say I have a string
where
few of the letters are in Upper Keys and
few of the letters are in lowercase
this time I am going to convert
everything into uppercase so I'll use
the upper function instead of case fold
let's run and see the result there you
go so this time
python has converted my original string
into upper case
and likewise you can also use the lower
case
instead of upper if I write lower you
see here everything has been converted
to lower case
cool
okay
now I'll show you how the title method
works so in title method all the words
basically the first letter of all the
words will be in uppercase so suppose I
have
a string which is simply learn
company so I'll write
let's say
this is my string and I'll
I'll convert my str1 to title keys
let me run it so this is the difference
you can see
the first letter of the first word is
uppercase
again
the first letter of the second word is
also in upper case so this is how the
title case works
you can also count the occurrences of a
particular element in a string suppose I
have string 1
that has Python programming
in str2
I'll write str1 Dot
and use the count function to count how
many times let's say n the letter N is
present
then I'll print
saying
occurrences
give a colon here
and then I'll pass in my variable that
is str2 so this will count the number of
times n is present in my original string
so if you see here in Python Programming
we have n present twice
similarly let's check for
G
the letter G is also present twice
let's see for y
now Y is present only once which you can
see here
okay
next
let's see how the replace function Works
in
python
and giving a comment as replace
so let's say I have a string str1
which has
Hamburg
is
located in France
so Hamburg is a city which is actually
located in Germany and not in France so
using the replace method we are going to
replace France with Germany so what I'll
do is I'll create another string str2
equal to I'll write str1 Dot and then
I'll
use the replace function
and I'll say replace
my string friends with
country Germany
and then we'll print str2 and see the
result
there you go
so we have changed
Hamburg is located in France too Hamburg
is located in Germany
now coming to the final method that we
are going to explore in this
python strings demo which is using the
split function
okay
so you can split the values or each word
in a string as separate words and store
it in the form of a list
so I
write str1
I'll just copy this
I'll paste it here and I'll change
France to Germany because Hamburg is
actually present in Germany and not in
France
and then I'll create another variable
called str2
I'll write sdr1 Dot and then use the
split function
now let me print both the strings first
I'll print str1
and then I'll print
str2
if I run it you see my original string
was Hamburg is located in Germany and
then using the split function we have
segregated or divided
each of the words present in the
original string into separate words and
this time it is present in the form of a
list
like any other programming language
python also supports various types of
operators so we'll understand each of
them with the help of examples
let's see what operators are in Python
The Operators are generally used to
perform operations on values and
variables in Python
these are standard symbols used for
logical and arithmetic operations
the value that the operator operates on
is called the operand
so here on your screens you can see the
different types of operators available
in Python
first we have arithmetic operators so
arithmetic operators are used to perform
mathematical operations because it
returns either true or false according
to the condition
so these are the comparison operators
you have less than greater than less
than equal to greater than equal to we
have not equal to and we have equal to
equal to third we have assignment
operators so assignment operators are
used in Python to assign values to
variables so these are the assignment
operators you have equal to you have
plus equal to so for example you have a
variable called X and if you say X Plus
equal to 7 this means
it is x equal to X plus 7
. similarly if you say x minus equal to
7 this means x equal to x minus 7 and
similarly you can see the other
assignment operators here
next up we have the logical operators so
logical operators are used in
the expression evaluation to make a
decision
if both the expressions are true then
the condition will be true for an and
operator
for an or operator if one of the
Expressions is true then the or
condition will be true
now for not
if an expression a is true then not e
will be false
we also have bitwise operators so
bitwise operators act on operants as if
they were strings of binary digits it
acts on bits and performs bit by bit
operation so hence it is called bitwise
operator
so here each value is evaluated as zeros
and ones
then we have identity operators so
identity operators are used to check if
two values are located on the same part
of the memory
two variables that are equal does not
imply that they are identical will
understand each of these operators in
the demonstration on the jupyter
notebook and finally we have membership
operators so membership operators are
used to test whether a value or variable
is in a sequence so you have is
and is not as identity operators in
membership operators we have in and not
in
now let's head over to our jupyter
notebook and we'll see
and explore all these operators one by
one
so I am on my Jupiter notebook operators
in Python
so let's first start with arithmetic
operators
I'll just
give a comment here saying arithmetic
operators
okay
first up we'll see the addition operator
for that let me assign
two variables so I have assigned a
variable X to a value 10 and let's say
we have the second variable y equal to
4.
now
if I say print
X Plus y
it will perform an arithmetic operation
that is addition and will sum the result
of X and Y N gives me 14 because 10 plus
4 is 14.
now let's say
I'll write print x minus y
that gives me 6 because 10 minus 4 is 6.
similarly you can have
multiplication as well so I'll write X
Asterix y that gives me 40 because 10
multiplied by 4 is 40. similarly let's
say x divided by y
it gives me 2.5 which is basically the
quotient
of these two operands
all right
now
if you were to find the remainder you
can use the modulus operator so I'll
write x modulo y
it gives me 2. so you divide 10 by 4 the
remainder is 2.
now you can use the
double asterisk operator which is
basically known as power
so the left operand is raised to the
power of right
I'll write print X
give two asterisks and then say y
it gives me 10 000 so what basically
python does is it will raise 10 to the
power of 4 so 10 is Multiplied 4 times
and the result is 10 000.
you can also try out another example
let's say 2 raised to the power of 4
this gives me 16.
if I say 2 raised to the power of 3
that is 2 Cube and the result is 8.
you can also perform flow division
so flow division results into whole
number adjusted to the left in the
number line so if I write print
X and flow division is
given by 2
forward slash
then I'll write y
that gives me 2 so it returns a whole
number
a generic division gives me 2.5
that has the floating point value but a
flow division will give me a whole
number
adjusted to the left on the number line
all right so these are some of the basic
arithmetic operators that are very
popular in Python
next we'll move on to assignment
operators
I'll give a comment as
ignment operators
okay
let's assign a value x equal to 7. so
here we are assigning the value of
7 to X
and you're equal to is an example of
assignment operator
now if I print X it will give me 7.
let's see I'll again write x equal to 7.
and in the next line I'll write X
plus equal to 3.
and will print X
so what python does is
it adds 3 to my original value that X
holds that is 7 so here X Plus equal to
3 means x equal to X Plus 3.
so
x equal to X plus 3 can be written as X
Plus equal to 3.
similarly
you can also
write x minus equal to something say x
equal to 7 and then I write x minus
equal to
3.
then we'll print X
this gives me 4
because
we are subtracting the original value of
x by 3.
so here x minus equal to 3 means x equal
to x minus 3. okay
similarly let's say I'll write X
asterisks equal to 3. if I run it
and print the value of x it gives me 12
because our previous x value was 4 and
now we have multiplied X by 3 so X
value now becomes 12.
let's say I will write X
divided by 3.
and I'll print X it gives me 4.0 this is
a floating Point number
so we are dividing 12 by 3 and the
result is 4.0
cool
if you want you can also perform
an exponent operation or a power
operation so let's say I have x equal to
7
and then I write X
double asterisks equal to
C2
and then we'll print X
okay there is an error here let's debug
the error
I have put a space here let's delete
that space you have to keep this in mind
now let's run it there you go so 7
raised to the power of 2 which is
basically 7 square is 49. you can change
the values and
run other examples let's say 10 raised
to the power of
3 we have 1000 as the result
okay
now moving ahead
now we'll understand about
comparison operators so I'll give a
comment
as comparison operators
okay
let's say I have x equal to 7 and then I
have y equal to 3.
if I print
x equal to equal to y
it will give me false the reason being
the value that X holds is not equal to
the value present in y these are two
different values that X and Y hold so X
is not equal to y
and if we print x equal to equal to Y it
will give us false
now
I'll just copy this code
I print it here
and instead of equal to I'll give not
equal to so not equal to is represented
by an exclamation mark followed by n
equal to if I write X not equal to y
this gives us true because X and Y are
two different values and they are not
equal
I'll print
my code again and this time let's say
I'll write
X
greater than
y
it gives us true because 7 is greater
than 3
if I write X less than y and hit shift
enter that gives me false because 7 is
not less than 3.
I'll print the code again this time
we'll see
if x is greater than equal to 3
if I run it it is true because 7 is
greater than equal to 3.
and
now let's check for less than equal to
this is false because
7 is not less than equal to 3.
okay so these are some of the basic
comparison operators that are available
in Python
now moving ahead we'll see
how logical operators work in Python
okay
first we look at the and operator
in Python
suppose I have a value
of 7 store in x
and then I have a value of 12 student by
if I write print
X
greater than
2
and Y
less than 10
let's run it and see the result it gives
us false now
and logical operators
will return true
if both the conditions are true
and it will return false even if one of
the condition is false
so here
X is greater than 2 which means 7 is
greater than 2 is true
but
y less than 10 which is 12 less than 10
is false and hence our entire expression
becomes false
next let's say I have x equal to 5
and then
I'll print
X greater than 3 or X
less than 10 if I run this
it returns us true the reason being
X greater than 3 is true which means 5
is greater than 3 that is true
but 5 is not less than 10 but since one
of the conditions is true so the or
operation in Python returns us true
now
let's see another example
I'll write x equal to 5 and
y equal to
10.
I'll print
X greater than 10 or
by
less than 20.
if I run this it returns true
so let's see our expression
X greater than 10 that is
5 greater than 10 is false but y less
than 20 so 10 is less than 20 is true so
our or operation will give us true since
one of the condition is true
now moving to the next logical operator
we have not
I'll given
comment here as R and now we'll see not
let's say I have x equal to 5 and then
I'll
print
X
greater than 3 and X less than 10 this
would ideally give us true the reason
being X is greater than 3 and X is less
than 10 let's run and verify okay so
this is true now let me copy this and
I'll paste it in the next cell
now I'll replace
my above print statement with a not
operator
and we'll close our print function with
another bracket now let's run it
so this will give us false because
my expression evaluates to true but not
true is false
okay
now moving ahead
let's discuss
identity operators in Python
all right
so we'll start by assigning a value of
let's say
505 to X
and then in y I will have
500 plus 5
so which is also 505
so X and Y hold the same value of 505
I'll print
comma y
so you can see here both the values are
same 505
for X and Y
now I'll use the
logical operator that is
double equal to or equal to equal to
I'll write x equal to equal to Y this
will give us true because X and Y hold
the
same value of 505 but
let's check with the identity operator
so I'll write X is y
if I run this it gives me false the
reason being
X and Y both refer to objects whose
value is
505
they are equal but they are not
referencing to this same object
now this you can verify using the ID
function in Python if I write ID of x
this will give me the memory location
that X has you can see this is the
memory location of x if I write ID of Y
there you go so this is a separate
memory location in which
Y is holding the value of 505 and hence
X is y is different and hence it is
false
now suppose I write x equal to 100 and I
have y equal to 200
if I write X is not y
this gives us true the reason being
X and Y both are holding different
values so X is not Y is true
let's see another example this time
we'll Define
2 less
so I have a list called a that has value
let's say
5 comma
6 comma
3 comma 7
comma 1 comma let's say 9.
and then
I'll have
another list
that will also have the same elements
I'll copy this and I'll paste it here
okay
if I write
c equal to a
and then we'll print
a is C
if I run this it gives us true because
we are assigning
the variable a to c and hence
the memory locations are the same for
both and hence
AC gives us true
what if I write e is B
now this gives us false
so here e and B are both less they are
equal but not identical it is because
The Interpreter in Python allocates them
separately in memory although they are
equal
okay now let's talk about
membership operators in Python I'll give
a comment as
membership
operators
okay
let's say I have a list
e that has
the above values five six three seven
one and nine I'll copy this and I'll
paste it here
okay I have
another list B that has different types
of elements we have four
next element is python
then we have
two
comma 7 comma let's see
simply load
and then I have 9
I'll run this first so I have my to list
e and B I have printed them
let's explore how the membership
operator works so we saw in the slides
in and not in our two membership
operators
if I write 5 in a and run it it returns
me true because you see here
5 is present in a and hence 5 enable it
on true
what if I write 55 in a
this gives us false because you see here
in the list a we don't have an item 55
in e
so it gives us false
modify right 4
in
p
the skips me true
you see here in B we have the element 4
so 4 and B is true
one thing I wanted to show you is what
if I write python
in b
you see here
it gives us false
though we have python
in our list B
but
the python I'm trying to check is not
present in B the reason being here
python is written in lower case
but
I am checking
python p is in uppercase
so it is case sensitive and hence this
gives me false
let's see
I'll declare a dictionary by equal to
and within curly braces I'll
give my key a
and I'll assign the value of India
let's say I have another
key B
and that has a value let's say USA
now if I check e in y
it gives me true because your key a is
present in y
now what if I check
India
in
y
now this gives me false so here
the membership operator won't work on
the values it only works on keys in a
dictionary
now let me go ahead and change the keys
to numbers I'll give one
that has India and the second key I'll
have 2.
now
if I change a to 1
it will work fine it gives me India
but if I write
USC in y it gives me false as I said
the membership operator won't work on
the
values it only works on the keys in a
dictionary
cool
now coming to the final section of our
demo
we'll explore about bitwise operator
okay
so Python bitwise and operator returns 1
if both the bits are 1 otherwise it will
return 0. so first let's see 7
ampersand 2.
if I run it it gives me the value of 2.
so what python does is it will first
convert the numbers 7 and
2 to their binary equivalence that is in
the form of zeros and ones and then it
will perform the bitwise and operation
so 7 Ampersand 2 the value is 2
if I write 3 ampersand
5
the value is 1 again it will first
convert 3 and 5 to Binary equivalence in
the form of zeros and ones and then it
will perform the and operation the
bitwise and operation
now the python bitwise or operator
returns one if any of the bits is one
if both the bits are 0 it will return 0.
so if I write
10
or
5
it gives me 15 so first it will convert
10 and 5 to Binary equivalence and then
it will perform the bitwise or operation
let's see another example I'll write 4
or 8.
I'll run it
so the bitwise or operation gives us 12
as the result
here we'll focus on if statement and
look at a small project in the end
so let's get started
in programming languages conditions play
a very crucial role they help us develop
programs that can satisfy all the
business conditions and perform well
so conditional statements are useful
when we have to decide that a certain
condition or certain part of a code
should run only if the condition is true
so the if statement is an example of
conditional statements the program will
first evaluate the test condition
and will only execute the code block if
the test conditional expression is true
so here you can see the syntax of if
statement first we have the if keyword
and inside
parenthesis we are going to pass the
condition and if this condition
evaluates to true then we go inside the
body of the if statement which is this
part of the syntax
now while developing a code for a
business problem you might have to use
multiple conditions so the alif
statement is used when we have to check
multiple conditions so here you can see
if the first test expression evaluates
to false then you have the alif
condition
and if the L if condition evaluates to
true then we go inside the body of the
alif statement which is this part of the
statement or the syntax that I am
highlighting
next
so sometimes you want to evaluate a
condition and take one path if it is
true but specify an alternative path if
it is not so this is done with an else
clause
so the else code block will run if the
expression is false so here you can see
if the
condition for the alif statement returns
false then we have the body of the else
statement
and finally
after
all the if elephant L statements have
been executed we'll execute if there are
any other statements which are present
outside the if condition now moving
ahead
we will use if else and alif statements
to write a program that will solve a
business problem
So based on the location and total
amount of the items we are going to find
the shipping cost
the locations are a few states in the
United States
in the if statement project we will ask
the user to enter the amount of the
package or the item and we'll also ask
the user to input the state name
so for the different states we'll Define
the conditions using the total amount of
the items and print the shipping cost
so let me take you to my jupyter
notebook where we'll do this project
okay so I am on my Jupiter notebook let
me just rename this notebook I'll say if
statement
and
project
all right
so
let me go ahead and
give a comment I'll say
package
delivery
cost
based on
the location and
total amount
all right
first and foremost I'll go ahead and
create a variable called total now this
will be
a user input so I'm using the input
function
and here I'll pass the message as enter
the
amount
for the item
all right
next
I'll assign
another variable
called State this is also going to be a
user input so I'm using the input
function
and I'll see
enter the state name in USA
so these are the two
inputs we are asking from the user that
is to pass the
amount for the item and the state in the
USA
all right now we'll start with our first
if statement I'll write if state
equal to equal to let's say my first
state name is Texas
make sure the syntax you are writing is
correct
now I am going to use
another if statement so this becomes a
nestative statement now I'll write if
total Which is my
item amount so I'm checking if total
amount
is less than or equal to
150
then I am going to print
shipping cost
in
Texas
is
let's see
30 dollars
all right
now I'll pass my next condition using
alif statement
since I am using multiple conditions so
hence I'm going to use
the alif statement this time I'll write
a total
is greater than 150 and
if my total amount is less than or equal
to 250 dollars
then I'll say
print
I made a spelling mistake this should be
shipping
I'll say print
shipping cost
in
Texas
is let's say
twenty dollars
so usually if your
amount of the item as high then the
shipping cost is low
so here you can see the total amount for
the package or the item is less than 150
dollars then your shipping cost is
thirty dollars but if it is between 150
and 250 dollars your shipping cost is
less which is 20 dollars
then I'll say else
print
shipping cost
in
excess
is
five dollars
so what basically this means is
if your total is less than or equal to
150 dollars then the shipping cost would
be
30 dollars
if your total amount lies between 150 to
250 dollars your shipping cost is twenty
dollars
and if the cost of the item or the
package is more than
250 dollars
the cost is five dollars
so this is for Texas state
now moving ahead
I'll write alif
this time
will check the condition for State let's
say Florida
I'll use a colon here and say if
my total is less than equal to 150
dollars
then we'll print
shipping
cost in
Florida
is
let's say 45 dollars
I'll use the ellipse statement again
I'll say LF
total
if it is more than 150 dollars and
if it is
less than or equal to 250 dollars
I'll write
print
shipping
cost
in
Florida is
let's say 35 dollars
next
I'll
write my L statement I'll say
print
shipping
cost
in
Florida is
let's say ten dollars
if the cost of the item is more than 250
dollars now one thing to note here is
the shipping cost is different for the
different states in the U.S
all right
now we'll move on to our
next date let me
give a space here
I'll say LF
State equal to equal to let's say we'll
take Virginia now
I'll see if total
is
less than or equal to 150 dollars
will print
shipping
cost
in
Virginia
is
let's say 23 dollars
all right
let's scroll down
next I'll write my yellow
statement I'll say LF
total
is
greater than 150 dollars and
total is
less than equal to 250 dollars
then
will
print
I just copy this message
paste it here
and we'll see recipient cost in Virginia
is
15 dollars
next
we'll write our
L statement else
print
the message again I'll say shipping cost
in Virginia is
five dollars
in case the cost for the items is more
than 250 dollars
now moving to our final state
I'll write another alif statement I'll
say alif State equal to
equal to let's say New Jersey
if
total
is less than equal to 150 dollars
then we'll print
just paste the message here I'll say
shipping cost in
New Jersey
is
let's say forty dollars
now I'll say LF
total
if it is greater than 150 dollars and if
total is less than equal to 250 dollars
will print
just put this within double quotes
and
I'll say shipping cost in
New Jersey is
let's say
ten dollars
I'll say else
print
my shipping cost
is
free
in case the
total amount for the items is
more than 250 dollars
all right
finally we'll have our
else statement where I'm going to print
invalid
state name in case the user enters any
other state apart from New Jersey
Virginia Florida and Texas
all right
so
we have our small project ready let me
just run through it
so first we are declaring two variables
total and state and we are taking this
as user input so the user is going to
input the
amount for the item or the amount for
the package and then
the user will input the state
so we have the four states defined here
and we are checking the shipping cost
for these four states based on
the amount for the items
all right now let me go ahead and run it
so here you can see we have our first
user input enter the amount for the item
let's see I have my amount as
125 dollars
and
the next input is enter the state name
in USA I'll say
let's say Florida
if I run this it gives me the shipping
cost in Florida is 45 dollars let's go
to the top and see what we have
now our total was
125 dollars Which is less than 150
dollars and hence it has printed
shipping cost and Florida is 45 dollars
let's run this again
this time I'll see
let's see my
item costs 255 dollars
in the state let's say New Jersey
let's run it
you see here it gives us the message
shipping cost is free now the reason
being if you see this part of the code
for state New Jersey
if the
total
amount for the items is
more than 250 dollars
the shipping cost is free
now let's try for another state
this time we'll see for Virginia
let's say my
amount is
190 dollars
and my state is Virginia
if I run it it gives me the shipping
cost in Virginia is 15 let's check our
code
so here I have entered my
item amount to be 190 dollars so it lies
between hundred and fifty dollars and
250 dollars and hence it has printed the
message that shipping cost in Virginia
is fifteen dollars
now let me enter another
state name that we have not defined
in our code let's say I have
my item amount as
290 dollars and the state name
I'll give us let's say Colorado
if I run it it gives us the message as
invalid state which is present in the
last part of our code so since we
haven't defined any shipping cost for
Colorado it has given us the message
that the state I am trying to search for
is invalid
you can check for
another state or any other country name
anything that is not part of our
project
let's see I'll enter my amount as
hundred dollars
and this time I'll enter my state name
as
let's say Ohio
and we'll run it it again gives us
invalid state
let's try out one last time I have my
package amount as 350 dollars and let's
see my state is
Alaska
again it says invalid state name because
we haven't defined any
condition for Alaska state so this was a
very simple project that we did using
Arif statement we saw how to write
nestative and we saw how to use the alif
and the
else statement if you are an aspiring
machine learning engineer looking for
online training and certification so
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simplyness professional
certification program in Ai and machine
learning from Purdue University that is
in collaboration with IBM should be a
right choice for more details you can
use the link provided in the description
box below but today we will focus on for
Loop in Python and look at different
code examples
so what is a for Loop in Python
a for Loop in Python is used to iterate
over the items or elements present in a
sequence
the items present in a sequence can be
in the form of a list Tuple dictionary
or even a string
a for Loop in Python uses the range
function to iterate over a specific
number of times
now let's have a look at the syntax of
for Loop so here on the left you can see
the syntax of the for Loop so we have
the for
keyword followed by the iterator
variable then we have the in keyword
followed by the sequence it can be a
list you can use the range function it
can be a dictionary a tuple anything
and after that you have your colon
followed by the statements that you want
to execute in the for Loop
and Below you have the rest of the code
and here on the right you can see this
is the flowchart of a for Loop so you
have for each item in sequence then we
check the condition if you have reached
the last item if that is true you exit
out of the loop but if it is false you
keep on running or executing the
statements that are present inside the
for Loop this will continue until and
unless you have reached the last item in
your sequence
okay
now let's head over to our Jupiter
notebook where we'll
see for Loop in detail
and we'll explore a lot of code examples
okay so here I am on my jupyter notebook
let's start by writing a simple for Loop
suppose I have a variable
say s and it has a value which is a
string let's say simply learn
okay
now
the way to write a for Loop is I'll say
for
I which is my iterator variable it can
be any valid variable name in Python
in
my variable that is s
so here s becomes my sequence
I'll say print
I
so what this for Loop is going to do is
it will iterate over all the characters
that are present in my string and print
them one by one
let me run it by hitting shift enter
you see here using this for Loop we have
iterated over
all the letters that were present in my
string that is simply learn and we have
printed them one by one
okay
now the print function in Python
provides a parameter called end so by
default
the value of the parameter is
backslash n that is the new line
character you can end a print statement
with any character or string using this
parameter which is end let me show you
what I
meant so I'll again
have my same string simply learn
I'll say for i n
my variable or my sequence s
I'll say print
I comma then I'll use my end parameter
equal to and
my end parameter will have a value of
Asterix
now let me run this you can see here
this is sort of a pattern that we have
printed so between each letter in my
string simply learn we have an asterisk
okay
moving ahead
let's see how to
use for Loop
in a list
all right
I'll declare a list called programming
and this list will contain
a few programming languages let's say we
have Java and then
the next item you have in the list is
python
next we have Ruby and then
we'll have HTML
okay
so I'm going to print
all the individual items that are
present in my list using the for Loop so
I'll use the same syntax I'll write for
this time I'll use my it to variable
name as iter which means iterator
for iterator or iter in
my sequence which is programming
I'll say print
iter
let's run it you see here we have
printed all the items in my list one by
one Java python Ruby and HTML
all right
now let's see an example how you can
find the average of a list of numbers
using for Loop so I'll give a
comment saying find the average of a
list of numbers
okay
so here
first of all we'll declare a
list of numbers with variable list
underscore num equal to
it will have a few numbers let's say 20
25 10. 50 and 40.
let's make it 45
now to find the average of a list of
numbers
first I'll declare a variable called sum
that will have
a value of 0 so we have initialized the
sum variable to 0
then I'll start my for Loop for I in
my sequence that is list underscore num
which is
this variable
give a colon I'll write sum equal to
sum plus I
so here
just give a space to make it more
readable
so I'm adding all the numbers in my list
and we are storing the result in the
variable sum
then we'll say
print
sum
equal to
I'll pass in my variable that is sum
then I'll say
print
average
equal to
now our average will be
by variable sum divided by
the length
of my
list that has all the numbers
let's run this you see here
so our total sum of all the numbers
present inside the list is 150 and the
average of all these numbers is 30 so
150 divided by 5 is 30.
all right
now let's see how you can use a for Loop
using a tuple
so let's declare a variable called num
this is going to be a tuple of numbers
and we have 30 45 60 50 and let's say 70
as the numbers inside the Tuple
I'll say sum equal to 0
then we'll have our for Loop for I in
my sequence that is num
I'll say
sum equal to sum plus I so here we are
just adding the values that are present
inside the Tuple
I'll say print sum
so here you can see we have
printed
all the values present inside the Tuple
one below the other now if I shift my
print statement to here
you can see here this is my
sum of all the numbers that are present
inside the Tuple so make sure you have
the current
indentation
now let's see how you can use the range
function in Python
okay
so you can use the range function to
iterate over a range of values or
numbers
using a for Loop
the way to do is I'll say for I in
my function range
I'll give my first index at 1 and my
second index at
or my end index at 10 so this will go
from 1 till 9 and exclude the 10th index
I'll say print I
you see here
for I equal to range 1 to 10 we have
printed all the numbers starting from 1
till 9 so the last index that is 10 is
exclusive in the range function
now in the range function you can also
give a third parameter that stands for
step so that you can skip a few steps
and print the next value let me show you
what I mean
say I write for I in range
0 which is my starting index
10 which is my end index and I'll have a
step size of 2
give a colon I'll say
print
display
values
with uh
step
size of
2.
give a comma here and my variable that
is I let's print it
there you go
so we have printed
the values with a
gap of 2 so it starts from 0 then we are
jumping two steps and then we are
printing two then again two steps we
have four six and eight so we are
skipping one value
and printing the next value
in my sequence
ranging from 0 to 10.
all right
now
let's write a program to print a table
of a given number
so I will give a comment as
program
to
print
table of a given number
all right
so I'll pass my
variable n
which is going to be a user input so I'm
using the int function and inside the in
function I'll use the input function to
take the user input
I'll give my message as enter the number
and I'll say for I in
range
from 1 till
11.
I'll say
multiply which is mul here
n Asterix I so basically what I am doing
here is
I'll take a user input of the number
let's say we want to print the table of
five
so from
1 till 10 will have the product of the
numbers
let me print it I'll say print
and
comma
within double quotes I'll give my
asterisks
comma I
comma
within double quotes I'll say equal to
and then we'll have our
variable mul
let's run this
enter the number I'll give 5 and hit
enter there you go
so here we have the multiplication table
of
my number five so you see
5 into 1 which is 5 5 into 2 is 10.
then we have 5 into 7 35 5 into 9 is 45
then our last index which ends at 10 so
we have 5 into 10 that is 50.
all right
so this is how you can create a simple
multiplication table using for Loop in
Python
now we can also use the range function
with a sequence of items
the Len function can be combined with
the range function to iterate through a
sequence using indexing I'll show you an
example here let's say we have a list
called list two and here we have
a list of programming languages let's
say C plus plus you can either use a
single quote or a double quote to
represent the
text values in a list
the next programming language I have is
Java
then let's say I have Python and we have
r
okay
so I can write for I in
range here I can use the length function
and I'll say
list two
give a colon
then we'll print
hello
and I'll say list two of I
so what it does is my iterator will
iterate over the list of programming
languages I have here
and it will keep on iterating
till
the length of the list and then I am
printing my messages hello
and it will take each item from the list
using the index number
if I run it you can see here it says
hello C plus plus hello Java hello
Python and hello r
cool
now let's see how you can use
nested for Loops in Python
I'll send a straight for Loop
as my comment let's say I have a list
of company names
my first company I have in my list is
Google
let's say apple
PWC
and then we have
Uber
so here I'll write for I in
companies
I'll say print
we will
display
each
letter of
I'll say plus I
now I'll use my second for loopsync for
letter in I
will print the letter
let's run it and see our result
there you go
so here we have used
two for Loops so that becomes a nested
for Loop you have my outer for Loop and
then we have our inner for Loop so in
the outer for Loop we are just printing
the name of the company so here we see
we will display each letter of
plus I which stands for
my company name Google so you can see
below we have
displayed each letter of Google using
the inner for Loop similarly we have for
Apple you can see a p p l e we have PWC
and then we have Uber
so this is how you can use
multiple for Loops in Python
now let's see how you can use a for loop
with else clause
so I'll give a comment for loop with
else clause
cell rate for I in range
0 comma 10 comma I'll give a step size
of 3
I'll say print I
and after this
python gives you the flexibility to use
an else clause
after the for Loop so I'll write else
print
the loop has
completed
execution
so this is my message that we are going
to print after we have printed all the
elements
that are present inside this range
function
let's run it you can see here we have
printed
the value starting from 0 with a step
size of 3 so we have 0 3 6 until 9 and
then
after that we have our else block
printed which has the message the loop
has completed execution
good
now let me show you
two more
important feature that you can use while
writing a for Loop one is called the
break statement the other one is called
the continue statement
so in Python you can break the for Loop
and end it before it has actually run
all the elements in the I treble using
the break statement
so let me show you a simple example if I
write for
just give a space here
I in
range
let's say from 1 to 10
I'll use an if condition saying if I
equal to equal to 6.
then break and come out of the loop
next we'll print I
so here what we are doing essentially is
we are iterating over
all the values from 1 to 10 and whenever
the I value becomes 6 we come out of the
loop and print
all the values we have iterated so far
let me run it and we'll see the result
there you go so here our I value started
from 1
we printed one two three four five and
then
our I value reached 6 then we use the
break statement to come out of the loop
all right
now
you can also skip the execution of
further statements in the for Loop
during the titration using the continue
statement in Python
so when a continuous statement is
executed the for Loop continues with the
execution of the next element in the
iterable it does not complete all the
statements in the for Loop body
so again we'll
give a comment
say continue
okay so I'll write for I in range
again from 1 to 10
give a colon I'll say if
my I value
is equal to equal to 6 then I'll say
continue
then we'll print I
let me run it and we'll see the result
okay so if you notice this
output so we have printed values from 1
to 5 and when my I value became 6. we
skipped printing 6 and we moved on to
the next element in the eye table which
was 7 then we printed 8 and 9.
so this is how you can use the break and
continue statements in Python
all right
now we'll see a program to display the
total goals a player has scored
so here we are going to iterate over a
dictionary
so I'll give a comment program to
display
the total goals uh
player has scored
all right
first of all
I'll declare a variable saying clear
name
and let's see we have the player name as
Carmelo
all right
I'll declare a
dictionary called goals
and within curly braces I'll have
my first
player name Edition
let's say addition has code
14 goals then we have let's say
Burnet
so Burnet is my key here and then we'll
have
value in terms of goals let's say three
and then we have our third player let's
say Carmelo
and Carmelo has scored let's say seven
goals
now I am going to write my for Loop so
I'll write for
my I triple name here is player in my
sequence name is cools so I'll say
goals
I'm going to check if
my player
is equal to equal to player name
I'll say print
the goals scored by the player
so I'll
pass my dictionary name and within
square brackets
I'll say clear
let's use the break statement
and then I'll say
else
will print
my message would be no player with
that name
found
let's run and see the result
all right so here what we did was
initially I declared a variable called
player name that had the value Carmelo
and since Carmelo was present inside my
dictionary
named goals you can see here we have
Carmelo who had scored seven goals
so I I treated Uber
my sequence cools and I checked if my
I treat her
that is player is equal to equal to the
player name which is Carmelo since this
Carmelo is present inside my dictionary
name so we printed the goals that were
scored by Carmelo that is 7. now let's
say I change this player name to
we have let's say Messi
now since Messi is not present inside my
dictionary goals if I run this it will
print no player with that name found the
reason being message is not present
inside
my dictionary called Ghouls
cool
now
we'll see two more
examples
this time we are going to print the cube
of
numbers using for Loop
all right
so first of all I'll declare a list
which will have a list of numbers let's
say 2 5
7 4 8 and let's say 6.
then
I'll pass in a empty list so I'll
declare Within
empty square brackets
I'll say for I in
my sequence name that is num
I'm going to use my empty list Cube and
Then followed by the append function
and inside the append function we'll
have our
cubes of the number so I'll write I
I'll use the double asterisk operator
and then I'll say 3.
after that we are going to print
my list name that is Cube
let's run it there you go
so you can see here
first we have
the list of the numbers here and then
we have printed the
cubes of these numbers in a pattern
let's say
bring this print statement here and I'll
run it again now this is much more
readable you have 2 cube is eight five
cube is 125 7 cube is 3 43
then 4 cube is 64 8 cube is 512 6 cube
is 216.
all right
now coming to
the last example in our demo section of
this
for Loops in Python video
will write
a program to print a pattern I'll say
pattern printing
all right
so we are going to print
a right angle triangle
for that I am going to take
my first variable called n which is
going to be
a user input to enter the number of rows
so using the input function I am passing
the message enter the
number of
rows
I'll say for I in
range 0 till my user input n
give a colon
I'll use my inner for Loop
this is
going to be the number of columns so
I'll say for J in
range
0
comma
I plus 1
give a colon
and
I'll print
my star pattern so I'm using Asterix
and I'll use my end parameter
I'll have my double quotations
and then
we'll say
print
the pattern
so here what I am doing is I'm taking
the number of rows from the user
and I'm iterating
from 0 until n which is my user input
and then
we are
assigning another for Loop for the
number of rows so that ranges from 0
till I plus 1
then I am printing my star
let's run it and see the output
let's say I'll enter the number of rows
as 6.
if I hit enter you can see here we have
our right angle triangle printed here so
initially
my
I value is 0
so here my J value becomes from 0 till 1
so we have just one star printed
in the next iteration my I value becomes
1.
so from
0 to 1 plus 1 that is 2 we have 2 Stars
printed the next iteration my I value
becomes 2 so 2 plus 1 is 3 again so we
have three columns here so three stars
printed so on and so forth
we will learn three Hands-On projects
that will help you improve your python
coding skills we have with us Anish
Karan who will take us through these
projects
so the first project we are going to see
is given a block of text you will count
the frequency of each word occurring in
the text or paragraph
in the second project you will trace the
movement of a robot the robot can move
up down left or right
you will write a program to find the
distance between the starting point
after a sequence of movements
in the final project we will write a
program to check the validity of
passwords given by the user often while
logging into a website or an application
you are asked to input the username and
password to register
our project will check the criterias for
setting a password and approve it only
when the criterias are met so a password
should have at least one letter between
a to z
at least one number between 0 to 9
uppercase letter one special character
and so on
so let's get started with our first
project
hello everyone and welcome to another
video on Python Programming in this
video we will be covering a sort of a
project side type of scenario which is
basically going to be a problem case for
you and it's going to be slightly
slightly difficult slightly tricky
um but what we're going to do is we're
going to tackle a particular problem and
we're going to what I'm going to do is
also show you a solution to that problem
so let's start with this so this
question that we have is
um we have this program that we have to
write where we compute the frequency of
words that exist in some input okay uh
the program should output after sorting
the key alphanumerically now this input
can be and it's basically a block of
text right so in our example we have for
example if this was our input right what
we want to see is
um
an output which is basically saying that
uh the word python has appeared say well
in this example this appeared five times
and then the word read has appeared one
time and so on and so forth like for
each of these words we want to see um
how many times have they appeared in
this particular block of text so let's
look at a particular example now where
we have done this so let's um let's see
here
so first of all I'm going to create a
dictionary so why am I creating a
dictionary is because I'm going to use
each unique word as a key and the number
of times they have appeared in a block
of text as the value to that key so um
I'm going to use a sample string which
is basically this long string that you
can see here which is stored in line so
this large chunk of text is what we're
going to be analyzing
um so how are we going to do this it's
pretty simple so we have this now what
we want to do is
um when we find what we one way of
tackling this problem that we're going
to do here is we want to
um check word by word
um first of all we want to see if it's a
unique word and if this word is
um we've encountered it for the first
time then we need to store a new key
here in our dictionary called frequent
table or frequency table
um and if it has already if there is a
key already with that particular name
then we just want to increment the count
or the value by one so let's see how we
do this over here
so if you can see in my this the
solution is as simple as this but if you
see what's happening it's basically what
uh what it's doing is we're splitting up
this string using the split function
what this will do is it will split up
the string at every white space so it
will take this as one part I'll take
this part as another part it will create
an iterable with each word as the um
each iterable object in that container
so it's going to be a list of words like
python is one so on and so forth and
we're going to go one by one so we're
going to say forward in line dot split
now if this word is if it exists in
frequency table as a key then
what we're going to do is we're just
going to increase the count of the value
of that key by 1 but if it does not
exist then we're going to actually
create a key with the word as that
unique word and we're going to create
its value
um initialize its value to 1. so when we
execute this
now if we want to once we've done this
we can sort it by the count of the words
so what we're going to do is we're going
to create a another Tuple called sorted
tuples where we're going to use the
Lambda function out here to sort the
um the dictionary in terms of its values
so what we're going to do is we're going
to take the key
the key being the Lambda item item with
index one index one is basically the
value so a particular key has a value so
the word python appears so many times
the per the word say scientist appears
so many times so we're going to check
which words have the highest number of
occurrences and we're going to sort it
in a descending order so that that is
basically what the reverse is equal to
True does so when we're going to sort
this when we're going to use the sorted
function when we say reverse true it
tells the Sorting function to sort this
dictionary
um this dictionary frequency table uh in
terms of value
by the the descending order so whichever
um word appears highest that would be
the first word in our sorted Tuple so
that's what we do in this line and once
we execute this we're also going to
print so if you see the result of this
activity that we've done you can see
that the word machine
um appears six times learning appears
six times then python appears 510 and so
on and so forth so we've created a
sorted Tuple where the first object of
the Tuple
we've created a list of sorted tuples
where the first object of the two each
Tuple is the unique word and the num the
second one is the number of times it has
appeared in this
um particular example or this particular
string
so yeah this was what the first basic
project that we have tackled if getting
your learning started is half the battle

hello everyone and welcome to another
video on Python Programming in this
video we will continue with what we
started in terms of our project number
one what we're going to do is
um we're going to tackle another
slightly complicated a question or a
situation
um we're gonna try to arrive at a
solution so in this what we have is some
sort of a robot a moving robot which
moves on a Cartesian plane a two
coordinate plane
um is going to move uh in terms of up
down left and right okay and each each
time it moves up or down or left or
right it takes a certain number of steps
in that direction
um integral steps of course so what we
need to do is from a starting position
whatever starting position is which we
are going to take as 0 comma 0 in this
example we're going to make it move to a
particular location with the commands up
down left and right followed by certain
steps and we're going to uh ask what
we're going to do is we're going to
calculate the distance between these two
points
um and we're going to calculate
different types of distances so you
might be introduced to New Concepts
um you know distance Concepts in this
video as well so what we're going to be
using for distance calculation is the
minkowski distance and that is
um we're going to take uh so the
minkalki distance between two variables
is basically the absolute difference
between these two variables of these two
points
um and we take it to the power of
something so if we want to say uh
calculate the minkowski distance with
um in terms the quadratic main Cloud
citizens with basically P2 so we are
going to do x i minus y i absolute
difference to the power 2 and then we're
going to take the second root of it
after summing each and every Point
um so when we take p is equal to 2 we we
say the minkowski distance behaves like
the euclidean distance and this is
probably one of the most common
distances uh in case you've done
um basic Cartesian geometry when you are
asked to find the distance between two
points on a plane we can also take the
absolute distance where we take p is
equal to one so in this case we're just
basically summing the absolute distances
between each point
um no roots no powers nothing basically
p is equal to one and we call that the
Manhattan distance so we're going to
take p is equal to 1 2 and 3 in each
case and we're going to find the
distance between two points uh based on
these
measures so
this is just a visual representation
this is basically the Euclid resistance
basically the estimate of the value
between these two points if um since
this is a two coordinate system whereas
the Manhattan distance would be the
absolute distance in terms of if we go
up and then we go right between these
two like say this was and this was
another Point
um so yeah
let's move on to the problem so what
were in this in this particular example
we are going to start from the static
position 0 and 0 on a on a graph and we
are going to give the commands of up
five down three left three and right two
so first of all what we want to do is
um we initialize the starting position
as 0 and 0 and we also just for the sake
of this example we initialize the end
position as 0 and 0. so what we're going
to do first of all is let's execute this
much now we have this list list of
tuples
um it's we're going to call this actions
and this is the actions that we're
performing so the this the each Tuple
contains an action and the number of
steps in that direction so it contains
four actions up by five steps down by
three steps left by three steps right by
two steps so now we're going to iterate
over this each Tuple and we're going to
get the direction first of all in this
line for each step uh and we're going to
calculate the number of steps it takes
so for each action it's going to first
tell
um it's going to check what is the
direction which is done by this line and
we're going to find out the number of
steps in the direction which is stored
in this line so
once you've gotten this for each action
we have to update the end position right
so what happens is if you go up by a
particular direction so you are
basically changing the y y axis right
the the y-axis so we're going to change
end position and the first index which
is basically this part of the end
position coordinate point so we're going
to say if it's moving by up then we're
going to uh update by adding uh the
y-axis by the number of steps so
um and and if the direction is down
we're going to do the same thing for the
y-axis but we're going to decrement it
similarly if we move left or right we're
moving the x axis right so we take n
position in the first index so we take
the x axis and if we're moving left it's
a negative uh it's a decrement and if
you're moving right it's an increment so
if there's any other like action like
any other action for example that was
given here we say pass so basically the
only valid actions that we can pass is
um up down left and right otherwise we
we just skip that particular action so
this is what the this particular Loop
will do it will update our final
position
so once we've done this
um if we if I execute this what will get
stored in the end position is basically
my end position so now that I have my
starting position and my end position
um just to show you what the end
Position will look like right now let's
just do this so if you see here after
I've moved up by five steps down by
three steps left by three steps and then
right by two steps my final end position
is minus one and two
um my start position on the other hand
was
as you remember it should be 0 and 0. it
is 0 and 0. so now we're going to find
the distance between 0 and 0 and -1 and
2. so we're going to first of all create
a function called minkowski distance
which which does the basic function of
just calculate the uh the difference
between the what do you say the N
position x coordinate and the N position
y coordinate times or to the power of a
root and we're basically going to do
this operation that you saw here we're
going to do this and um we're going to
uh we're going to
use this root variable to specify to
like P is equal to one two or three like
what P value we want to take for this
minkowski distance so once we've done
this what this function will do is
basically store uh this much and it will
wait for us to uh it will basically wait
for us to give us a root so when we give
root 1 it will create these it will
check the distance between the end and
starting points
um with the p-value of one if you gave
it two it will calculate euclidean
distance with p-value 2 similarly for 3
and we can calculate for any Roots so
we're going to calculate for one two and
three roads and we're going to see what
values we get in each case
so when root is equal to 1 I print a
statement saying minkowski distance with
root one is something and then root 2
it's something root 3 something let's
see what results we get
so if you see here the minkowski
distance with root 1 is actually 1.0 but
the euclidean distance between these two
points is 2.23 whereas the uh the cubic
menkowski distance with basically the
with root 3 is 1.91 so you see these
three different distance measures for
the same distance between two points so
in this video you basically so in this
basically by doing this activity you
might must have you will learn how to um
basically how to iterate through loops
and perform these distance calculations
which you will find pretty handy in many
activities related to data science and
machine learning
so yeah this was on the project two
hello everyone and welcome to another
video on Python Programming in this
video we will be continuing tackling
different uh problems and problem cases
in terms of a project called project
three where we're going to be using
regular Expressions to validate whether
certain passwords that have been entered
do they match certain criterias or not
so let's look into our particular
question we have a website that requires
users to input username and password to
register now we have to write a program
to check the validity of passwords input
by the users now the criteria is that
the passwords have to follow are that
there's at least one number between a
and z and this is at least one number
between is at least one letter between a
and z and one number between 0 and 9.
the third criteria is that uh there's at
least one letter between capital A and
capital c so this first and third Point
basically is saying that there should be
one lowercase letter and there should be
one uppercase letter
um now there should be at least one
character from dollar sign hash or the
at simple
um it should have a minimum length of 6
and the maximum length of 12. so when we
whatever passwords that we enter into
our example they must be comma separated
so we're going to have an input they're
going to ask us for an input where we're
going to have to input the different
passwords in a comma separated way so
let's look let's look at how do we
tackle this so for my example I'm going
to use these uh examples in terms of
these are my password examples if you're
going to check if these are valid
passwords or not so let's copy this
first of all
and now let's import the re which import
re is basically the regular expression
module now in this step is going to ask
us to input the passwords as you can see
here so I will just Ctrl V so since this
is comma separated what it will do is it
will split up each of these uh by the
comma and it will store them in a list
so it will take this as one password
this has another password this has
another password and this has another
password once I press enter
now if I want to check what's in list I
mean what's in items what I can do is
just check over here what's in items
it's a list of whatever passwords I had
entered each object is separately
treated now in this list now I'm going
to create a an empty list called value
first of all once I've done that I'm
going to move on to the next step
so once I created my list called value
what I'm going to do is now I'm going to
search and I'm going to check for each
condition using regular expressions for
whatever criteria that we have initially
so if you see here what I'm going to do
is first iterate by each item in this to
check for each password now my first
check will be a basic check for the
length of the password if it's lesser
than 6 or greater than 12 then our uh
our basically our password is illegal so
we can't be using this and we will just
continue and we won't check for anything
else but if it is within 6 and 12 the
length uh 6 and 12 then we can continue
with our check so we can do we'll do an
else statement for pass which basically
moves on to this next block
now once you've done this what we will
do is this this first statement what
this is going to do is it's going to do
an re.search and re.search as you know
is going to look for at least one
instance of um
a letter occurring between a and z so
this ire dot search followed by this now
this is the regular expression that we
have passed and what this does us is
basically the square in the square
brackets we're looking for anything
between uh A and Z in terms of small
letters so if
um this is if this condition is not met
then again we continue and we leave this
particular search because one of our
criterias is not met all right but if it
is met then this if not statement will
not uh like we won't enter this block
and we can move on to the next check so
now now we move to LF naught now again
we're using if not statement so this is
basically checking for uh a negative
case so anytime one of these cases have
been met it basically means that our
password has been invalid because these
conditions are not being met so we're
trying to eliminate all uh conditions
all of these conditions so that we get a
valid password so again we move on to
the next statement which is basically
going to do the search for numbers once
again if we find a case a password
without any numbers we continue and we
don't
um check this password no more because
we already know it's a it's an illegal
password now next check will be for
capital letters a to z and the next
check again will be for these particular
symbols the dollar the hash and the ad
one of these three symbols finally we
have a a search for
we're going to search for a white space
character so if we actually do find a
white space character in our password
um that's an illegal password and we're
not going to continue checking for those
cases
so
um so this is basically all our cases uh
lowercase letters numbers capital
letters these one of these three symbols
and the existence of a white space so
once we've done all these checks if if
none of these have been passed we move
on to this else statement where we just
pass and what we can do is we append the
value we append the value to uh we we
append P to the uh the the list call
Value so basically what happens is
um just to go through it again if this
condition is not met and this condition
is not met this is not met this is not
met this is not met and this is also not
met
um then we're fine so basically as long
as we have small letters as long as we
have a number as long as we have a
capital letter as long as we have one of
these three symbols and as long as we
don't have any uh White space characters
we can append e to this otherwise guys
it will continue and it will break out
of this for Loop completely that's what
the continued thing the continue
statement at the end of each of these
blocks checks
um anytime this condition is met uh this
if not condition is met then we break
through we break through this uh whole
for Loop and we don't append P to the
value but uh if you actually get to this
stage then what we can do is simply
append uh P to value now finally what we
are going to do is we are going to print
out all the valid
um all the valid passwords so just by a
quick look you can see here
um
this is a valid password right so let's
execute this and let's see uh what we
get if you see here we only get one
valid password and let's look at why
some of these do not turn out to be
valid so if you look here all of the
conditions are met it has a capital
letter it has a small letter it has at
least one number and it has one of the
symbols either dollar sign or the hash
sign or the AD Sign In this case we have
two white spaces one over here and one
over here so this is an illegal password
similarly in this case also we have an
illegal password because it begins with
a space in this case it's the same thing
we begin with the space and also it does
not have any of those symbols that we
were looking for the dollar or the hash
or the ad so again so these three are
illegal passwords and they do not get
appended to Value however this does get
appended to Value and that's why we get
the result for only one password which
is the only legal password and this was

foreign
and welcome to Simply launch YouTube
channel you're already watching simply
learn and today we bring you this
informative video about Adobe XC
tutorial this tutorial is designed for
learning UI ux design using Adobe XC it
is very useful for UI and ux designers
graphic designers
and the other professionals as it is
leading and training the market among
the UI designing tools available because
of its many Advanced features and tools
before we begin if these are the videos
you like to watch then hit that
subscribe button and the bell icon to
get notified and if you are a tech geek
here is a brain teaser for you
who coined the concept of adobe XD
the first one is Don Norman telling
Wordsworth Dylan feel or is it Draymond
Loy let us know your answer below and
get a heart from Simply without any
further delay let's get started with the
session
now let's take a quick look at the
agendas first
here we cover the basics on Advanced
topics of adobe XE first we will start
by understanding what Adobe XC is will
then review some of the Adobe X's
Advanced features then we'll see how
prototyping Works in Adobe XC
lastly useful tips for Designing and
creating image graphics and web designs
in Adobe XD with top use cases what is
Adobe XT
Adobe X is a powerful and trending
design tool that is easy to use and a
vector-based software tool for Designing
digital designs and prototyping UI ux
that gives a tool that a developer needs
to develop the world's best experience
collaboratively
Adobe X is designing the UI or ux for
web applications mobile applications and
many applications it also provides an
ideal way to create assets for different
applications Adobe X is provided and
managed by Adobe Inc it comes for Mac OS
operating system and windows only we
cannot use it in Linux based operating
systems it creates a web-based link that
can be open using any web browser but
Adobe XD becomes the most useful tool
before Adobe XD the photoshoot tool was
widely used for design purposes but
Photoshop doesn't have a user experience
there's this advantage of Photoshop
design makes Adobe XC the most efficient
design tool as we have an application
for user experience it's prototyping and
animation features give the application
a complete virtual tool the best thing
about Adobe X is that it provides a user
interface for design each tool in Adobe
XD has optimal options making it
incredibly simple to utilize as a result
it saves the designers a huge amount of
time on the same project designers make
various places can simply work together
team members can watch and provide
comments and suggestions through
commenting and pinning directly from
their browser using the link sharing
tool now we will see what are the
advanced features of adobe XE Adobe hexd
has a wide range of extensive and
Powerful features and applications that
makes it an essential tool for any ux
designer some highlighted features of
adobe XCS are the first one is
components and States second padding and
stacks
the third one is repeat grade and the
last one is responsive resize so the
first one is components and States these
are Advanced features that photoshop
doesn't support components allow the
creations of it funds and then can use
it multiple times in the same existing
project providing features to the
applications when building certain
Design Elements like buttons and
navigations and maintaining the
alignments across our design components
are helpful changes we make to the
primary components will also affect the
supporting components therefore it will
be helpful for design changes and for
the stats as opposed to components are
also effective approach to making the
design functional we can preview our
variations on a single components thanks
to States States can be used to design
produce effects like
H over
click
toggle and many more and it is helpful
to create and design cleanly by reducing
the number of artboards for example
instead of developing a new artboard for
a drop down menu we can construct one
using a click state so the next one is
padding and stacks these are also some
Advanced features of adobe XD that are
not available in other designing
softwares like photoshops and are useful
features of adobe XT it is very helpful
when working with Dynamic content such
as buttons
and labels
and managing content sections and
exploring design it will save
significant time and effort and provide
a well-organized design structure and
the third one is
repeat grid repeat grid is also one of
the excellent feature of adobe XD and
also one of the best feature of adobe XC
by using a feature of a repeat grid we
can easily cope up with the same layout
multiple times it can be used in
building the images data tables image
galleries
another things it takes a long time to
design these UI components the repeat
great functionality could save our lives
inside circumstances we may turn on the
repeat grid for a certain items with
just one click using the repeat slider
we may repeat any objects or collections
of object once the repeat grid features
its enabled the text and graphics on the
repetition grid can also be modified
and the next one is
responsive resize the world is full of
different types of e-gadgets smartphones
smart watches and TV so while working
with the design we must ensure UI
compatibility for all sizes of devices
the responsive resize features allow us
to automatically understand the design
for a new device and fit the design in
there are several other exclusive and
intelligence features of adobe X3 that
allows us to choose Adobe XC over any
other graphic designing software to
understanding some of the features of
adobe XC we will see how prototyping
Works in Adobe XC Adobe exists supports
Dynamic and interactive prototyping for
the design to interact with different
layouts we can add animation transitions
to stimulate the flow of the application
we provide a real-time preview of the
application using the Prototype features
of adobe XD we can experience a virtual
tour of the application the Prototype
can be shared with the team and
stakeholders through a web link the team
can experience a complete preview of the
applications and provide valuable
feedback right from the browser Adobe X
is a post Dynamic and interactive
prototype for the design to interact
between different layouts we can add
animation transitions to stimulate the
flow of the application it provides a
real-time preview of the application
using the Prototype features of adobe XD
we can experience a virtual tool of the
application
the prototypes can be shared easily with
the team and stakeholders through of
Appling the team can experience a
complete preview of the application and
provide valuable feedback right from
their browsers
so in the design mode we create the
design for our applications using Adobe
exe tools and Designs features
then we switch to prototype mode to
specify the interactive links between
the artboard and components we can also
create prototypes using the component
State once we are done with the design
and prototype we can share the design
using the shear feature we can preview
the designs and prototypes using the
previous features the protab is one of
the finest features of adobe X which
makes it different from other tools
we can also add Transitions and
animations to our prototypes While
redirecting to other screens after
understanding how prototyping Works in
Adobe XC we will understand the top uses
of adobe X3 in different fields top
Adobe XD use cases
Adobe X is a flexible tool and can be
used for a wide range of design projects
some popular uses include
create wireframe templates and
prototypes
design user interface
create illustrations and graphics
streamlines the UI and ux design process
enjoy custom design and the last one is
design augmented and virtual reality the
first one is create wireframes templates
and prototypes Adobe exists an excellent
tool for quickly creating wireframes and
prototypes creating simple and complex
design is easy and you can add
interactive elements to make your
prototype more realistic the Prototype
tool is excellent for web design more
curves and mobile apps and for making
real-time updates to your UI and ux
project
and the next one is design user
interface Adobe X is a great tool for
Designing it's a vector base so you can
create designs and has many built-in UI
elements to use in your designs
the third one is create illustrations
and graphics
Adobe XD is a great tool for creating
illustrations and graphic design
elements offering an extensive creative
library with the vector images
shapes colors and fonts the interactive
prototype updates in real time so your
workflow is fast and responsive when
building mobile apps and web designing
and more
the next one is streamline the UI ux
design process Adobe XD makes it easier
to duplicate and reuse the common
elements create repeating content and
automate the process to save time
so the next one is enjoy Custom Design
Adobe XD lets you create variations of a
single components and maintain spacing
between the contents of a group and the
other bounds it is possible because of
its padding options
unless customizations using space
wireframes
and colors and more within the Adobe XC
design system and the last one is design
augmented and virtual reality Adobe exit
supports designing augmented and virtual
reality experience you can add 3D
objects to your prototypes and test how
they work in an immersive environment
making crafting AR and VR experience is
even if you are a beginner let's take a
look at Adobe experience design XC is a
part of the Adobe so it's that uh
primarily focus on UI design a ux design
prototyping and responsive web designs
it's available for both Mac and PC as
long as you have an adobe CC
subscription it's most definitely
competitor to along the modern design
tools that have come out recently and
you might be using like sketch or figma
or the Dozen others that are on the
market right now
so in this video I'm going to cover the
basic things you need to know about XC
when you first open up the project to
help you to get up and running and feel
really confident about the program I'm
ready to get started I hope you are
let's do this thing okay let's get jump
into right the computer and figure out
when the 10 basic things or the basic
that you need to know about I'm just
going to roll and I'm going to open XC
okay and we will open up the program and
you can see it's open it's right up and
it's dropped as an artboard
into our canvas the artboard system is
really common things nowadays and model
design tools and exists no different and
allows you to put new artboards onto the
canvas anytime you want you can do that
by rolling over over here into the tools
panel and here an artboard tool and you
can use the hotkey of a and and you can
you can do the things you can draw out
and customize the size of an artboard
and I'm just gonna command set to undo
that
or you can choose from the different
selection that we have like we have
iPhone x up here maybe we want to do
like an Android mobile device as well
and then and I'm going to like an iPhone
14 pro to the right and then it's every
time you want to put an artboard just
down on the screen it's going to just
space it when you open out to the right
and also with artboard
um you can you can use and also with our
board you can press V command or use
your selection tool and you can grab the
artboard by just grabbing the top kind
of portion of the name of that artboard
and you can move it around the canvas
and you can get some automatic snapping
for
spacing and all that kind of good stuff
but that's the first thing
um that uh you need to notice how to
make artboard how to move them and also
how to resize them by just simply that
and all right so the second thing uh you
probably need
um you need is a basic tool or
understanding of the interface and so
what we are going to do right now
is very general fashion natural in depth
we're just gonna kind of cruise through
the interface
and show you what we have on the very
left hand side we kind of already
covered it we have the tool panel where
you can drop the different shapes or
lines you can use your pen tool text and
you can zoom in
each of these have an hockey and that
you can learn to kind of speed up your
workflow sorry
down at the bottom of this same panel
and you can see there we have a hard key
and as well as and you can click over
yeah these assets the assets where in uh
in where X is gonna store all of your
colors and your characters style and
your reusable symbols or components you
can reuse through your projects and so
you knowing how to click
back and forth between your layers and
your symbols or your layers and your
assets really powerful part of x3 right
next to that we have all the artboards
displayed we can see all the tree on
their own separate line up at the top
left
uh you can see we are currently on the
design Tab and we'll talk about this
layer but we can click over to prototype
tab where we can able to create
interactions between our kinds of
artboard and create interactive
prototypes so that's the difference
between these two tabs that we have the
name obviously of our project
and then
we have some Basics controls on the top
right like zoom in zoom out like what
percentage are we currently looking at
and it it we want a device preview with
our desktop preview it looks like so we
can we can share these designs and then
you all have your basic tools if I just
draw a rectangle and then you have all
your basic tools if I just want to draw
a rectangle
and then if you all see a basic tools I
have just drawn the rectangle and you
see over in my properties panel uh then
you have all your alignment tools and
some interesting repeats grid and you
have a Pathfinders or the Boolean
operations and you have all your
different properties uh for your width
your height
your X and Y value and we have some
different prototyping options
as well as all of your appearance
options like colors tags and different
track sizes and all the good stuff is
there and that is a basic tool of the
interface of the interface all right the
third thing you might want to know how
to do using Adobe XC like any other
Adobe product is to use the pen tool and
that's by simply clicking on the pen
tool in the tools panel or by pressing
the hotkey of P once I do it I get my
pen icon and I can start by adding notes
to my artboard and and create custom
shapes filling those custom shapes with
colors coming back and redness of
red dressing we can re-wrest the
individual node and we can redress in
the individual mode and I can add new
nodes and however any line I can redress
in the individual node to
I can add new node
by hovering over any line I can I can
also delete each no each one at a time
by pressing delete key and it will just
slowly moved around and delete each of
these points a few interesting things
about the pen tool in Adobe XC is that
unlike most other Adobe products May
hold
hold down shift and gently I can hold
down shift and get
increments on I can just kind of free
form it by doing it with nothing but my
hand once I release and I have created
here a brazzer curve so it's gonna be uh
and it will come out straight it's gonna
automatically kind of smart pan or both
the curve I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing it's just a thing
if I created a straight line and if I
hold down the option key like is in most
of the program I can just control one of
the basic handles instead of both the
handles to give myself
um a little
a little bit more controls of where I'm
going to go next but the automatic curve
thing it's a little bit
um yeah the fourth thing that you are
gonna want to know about in x uh in
Adobe XC is about Styles and reusable
symbols we have created kind of funky
shape on our canvas and I can select the
shape and fill it with and we can add an
ugly color
yeah that's not such an ugly color but
now let's say I want to make this some
sort of reusable component that I could
use over and over in this a bad use case
on it I had it's probably be something
more likely a button or logo or a
certain style that you can have to going
on your project
but for your our example this would do
this will do if I want to create a
reasonable symbol out of this
element though I will I would roll all
the way over to the left and down
between my acid and my layers I have an
asset panel and it's here there's a few
there's few things I can do while I'm
here in my asset panel I could probably
create a reusable color so now I have so
now I we have a border color and the
fill color that are both a part of now
that the rest of this design this design
and I can always come back and reuse
those Styles I can also create a
reusable symbol and I can rename this
symbol I can call block because this
what uh what it looks like to me and
anything and anytime I want another one
of these I could either option to drag
and this could either option drag
another one out or I could drag one from
my my asset panel and there is like I
like this it's a nice visual
representation of all your reusable
components in your project and it's
really really nice simple work in a very
interesting way I will say you just take
any of the represented represented
symbols on the canvas and you can change
the properties with the color and will
change the size of this
right
and I can also double click and change
the size of the element when I do that
it changes every symbol not only on the
canvas but also the symbol panel
so
yeah
so that's
so that's kind of interesting so now we
have changed the size of our symbol
and maybe we want to have that color
into our colors we also have character
Styles so I can use my text to I just
drag out some text and say let's just
write headline
and we will let's choose a headline
and just drag out some text
and say that's uh uh and say that let's
just write a headline
and we can let's choose a headline
like maybe we will all grab
uh Futura
are bold
or let's make the size little big
and maybe even
um make it little more bold
yeah
and our headlines still something like
60 and then we can take the characters
style and we can take that uh headline
into our character Style
and we can add it into our character
character style panel and we can rename
like and we can tag the take the
character style and we can add it into
our character style panel and we can
rename this
like maybe we want this just to be like
H1 and so now
so we have a headlining and anytime we
have like two new text we could start
uh when typing anything like
she
uh with
a kind of text that I was using I can
apply that the character style simply by
clicking on my new
and text and double clicking on my
character Style on home and we have our
Hardline style has been
has been applied on one thing and I
really enjoying is if you have a
multiple of those Styles or multiple uh
of those symbols on a page or across
different canvas you can right click and
highlight all of them on every canvas
throughout your entire project that's
really really cool
as well the fifth thing we are going to
talking about Adobe XC is in my opinion
uh
one of its coolest features and that's
its ability to repeat great and speed of
the design process with its repeatable
grid features I have now created what I
consider to be a reusable component
I am going to click
I'm gonna click back over to my
layers View and I'm gonna group The
together
I will I'm just gonna call that card
okay
now I'm gonna group uh that together uh
together I'm just gonna call that card
okay
and now I want to perhaps make lots of
these cards and then added the spacing
and how they all work together like all
at one time instead of duplicating again
and duplicating
instead I can just click on the element
I want to duplicate and head over to my
properties after dragging down and all
the copies of its offered appear and now
we can have multiple copies that are
being controlled by our grid we can just
kind of fix them like and that if you
want to change or added the spacing
that we have of our cars in between from
one to another we can literally just
double click
and we can roll over those margin areas
and we can grab and just kind of stretch
out to our liking so now and this
feature is very extremely enjoyable I
think it's really speed up kind of the
rapid prototyping aspects of design as
well as some of that in tedious kind of
back and forth of spacing things you
don't have to do that because all these
taken care
of right here in our repeat grid
function the next thing we need to talk
about is prototyping it's a kind of big
deal in XD it's so big it has its own
tab up the top of the left to and to the
right of the design now we are in the
Prototype Tab and prototyping is really
really easy you literally just gonna
click on any sort of element that you
want to like
um for instance for our our cards or for
the triangle or for the circle
I'm going to
grab the tab and just connect it to and
you're gonna set it any type of trigger
for instance I'm putting the trigger as
a tab and animation should be like I
will choose only Auto and meet and this
one
back to this for this we have to
see whether is it working or not first
we will tap on this and we have the play
button over here so the thing it will
pop out and when uh the thing we have
putting on the trigger as by tapping
when we will tap on
the circle the next page of the iPad is
coming after the iPhone 14 pro to the
iPad 1.
so our final point it's all about
sharing sharing is creating and as the
is all about sharing and so we are not
uh we are sorry we are in our prototype
view right now
uh it doesn't matter if you are in your
design or prototype the share icon will
always show up and the very top right
and by clicking I can publish the
prototypes and some prod publish some
design space manage my public links but
first thing we are to do publish our
prototype we are going to allow with
this we come to the end of this session
where we understand the basics of adobe
XD after completing these steps you now
understand the fundamentals of adobe XD
you must keep an eye out for the next
release because the program constantly
evolves and add new features Adobe X is
a relatively straightforward
user-friendly and effective tool for
developing and prototyping your apps for
user interface do you have any doubt
about Adobe XD please let us know in the
comment section and stay tuned to Simply

hi everyone
very good morning one and all and today
this video is mostly focusing on slide
drift towards the preparation of aims
because aims notification is out and the
examination will be on number 18 right
so the examination date is out so there
should be slightly drift from your need
preparation just go ahead with aims ones
aims is done and again you need to come
back to your need preparation okay so
before going in detail there are few
questions a few generalized questions
that are posted by interns in specific
and repeaters in specific okay I'm just
going to deal I'm just going to have a
look at these questions and if you are a
student of MDS counter if you're already
part of MDS conquer or if you're about
to join MDS conquer
Ames is must for all MDS conquer
students you can immediately ask me why
okay there are many reasons second you
thousands of explanation by Ames is must
why Ames you need to go ahead with Ames
before need there are many many many
reasons for that okay I will discuss
those reasons in specific in the group
but I just want to highlight four or
five important things that are very
important which are going to create a
greater impact in your need examination
hall one is particularly if you are an
intern okay if you are an intern
definitely Ames is going to be your
first exam if you are a repeater and
have not attempted exam last year
definitely Ames is going to be your
first exam I mean leave a put your
regular weekend examinations that are
giving on site or on phone leave about
them because they are not going to
create a good impact on you because few
people they give examination on so on
few people take your examination with
lots of disturbance so you can't imagine
that as a final exam it does not it's
not going to create a greater impact
it's not going to create the impact that
a final exam is going to create okay so
examination in a particular cell
in a particular hall and okay with all
the rules and regulations is going to
give you an idea that what is going to
happen on the day of need itself and
specifically in terms and the people who
has not given the last year in terms it
is mandatory that you have to give your
ends exam because it's going to give an
idea that's what is going to happen on
the day of need okay that is the first
best reason why I asked you to go ahead
with the examination so apart from these
majority of your need and measured of
your aim centers are metropolitan cities
with hectic traffic and have tech
pollution right and how you get prepared
because regular weekend examinations you
see in a decent room in a detail decent
atmosphere and few people few in terms
of work on libraries a few people who
are working on offline center that
closed in a decent place where they are
working more regularly the examination
will be a part of daily life okay for
example online people the examination
will be on Sunday they'll have a decent
break first decent I mean everything
decent and sit in Idol room and give an
examination done offline people in a
different atmosphere examination ISM but
what is going to happen on the day of
examination is a question because you
need to travel a long distance one day
before examination you need to stay in
order place I mean people locality of
Hyderabad or locality of metropolitan
cities ok acceptable but 80% is where
people are from different places who has
to travel long distance towards the
metropolitan cities for your respect to
centers means you need to get your
things ready there are lots of things
that are going to play a role because
you need to sleep one day before
examination in our odd place it may
affect your sleep patterns so apart from
these there are many things your food
habits your water you drink pollution
traffic you journey everything is going
to play an important role so if you
encounter any difficulties in your aims
examination you can correct them for
your need if you have difficulties in
your need exam you
you can correct them in the next year me
that's what that's the reason why I'm
asking you to give James examination and
once you're under the examination hall
there will be few things that are
happening in your mind because 8ml is
the one that's going to play a vital
role few people edenal comes into action
when you serve the proper few people it
may take 10 to 15 minutes so that's
that's again an important thing when
you're giving exams like aims and meet
time factor is very important thing so I
feel like time factor is going to play a
very very vital role in your needed some
so you are going to get prepared for it
by analyzing the aims examine a few
things like you may go wrong overlooked
your mind may not work well you feel
like some sort of revision is required
for this particular thing everything is
going to keep something everything
you're going to learn something from
your aims exam and that's going to play
a very vital role in your need so I want
you guys to cue your aims exam like a
best short and it is must for all the
MDS Conquer students so coming to the
scores once the result of aims is out
everything you need to take in a
positive sense because there are few
people who get frustrated with the ranks
in the end but it's not in the same way
it should not have a main intention of
giving your aims exam same thing should
not happen there are few negative things
that can happen in your aims exam they
should not happen that's a primary goal
it's not about getting a see it's not
about breaking something it's not about
all this okay this can happen too
but main intention is there are few
negative aspects in the aims exam that
may happen to you but it should not
happen to me if they should be modified
whether your revision whether your
aspect towards the preparation whether
the traffic whether the pollution
whether the food habits for the water
whatever there are many multiple factors
are going to contain your examination
apart from your stuff what you are
carrying in your brain so stuff what you
are having in your brain this is like 30
to 40% there's there many other factors
are going to play a role so you will
know what are these factors and you will
know how to control these factors by the
day out of need exam I hope this is very
very very very clear
simply give a tag to
James number as a trial version of your
meter so China is a very important thing
for a movie right so similarly your Ames
exam is very very important not to get
your names because getting into Ames is
just like one percent is not one also
it's like 0.001 percent is missing out
of 10,000 people only 10 people will get
into Ames exam okay so it's not about
the main primary goal is not about
getting a seed names is to learn
something which should not happen in
your mid second object is getting a good
seed that I mean like apart from the
hard work and smart things what we are
doing we need some margin of luck to be
able to talk five six okay in the same
thing I hope you're very clear why you
should kill Ames exactly and the fees is
also acceptable that is thousand rupees
and measure it of your centers of Ames
and need the coincidence so it is good
TQ Ames examination at any cost
okay because things which are done in
the need should not have an impact
so if same things were done in Ames you
can you have an ample time like thirteen
forty days you can correct them you can
focus them and you can give your best
shot for your need exam and the next
question you can ask me like you said
some drift towards the preparations what
is the drift actually what is the
difference between Ames preparation they
need preparation people of MDS conquer
from the past six months few people from
eight months a few people from one here
or really working hard here and what is
the drift that is needed sir
the next question drift is already
implemented in your schedule stripped is
already implemented in your question per
person the drift is like my main focus
towards the Ames drift is a diagram
based questions because your meet is
going to have two or three diagram
discussions
count of 240 whereas your Ames will have
25 to 30 or diagram based questions in a
90 marks back that simply gives an
example that one-third of questions
means 33 to 35 percentage of your aims
question paper is completely free with
diagrams and most of these diagrams are
free
economy based diagrams so that's that's
a gist
we need because NBS conquer it's a media
sharing way of discussing the things
it's a media the video way of sharing
the questions it's a media way of giving
that examination so everything is
related to media and it's the easy way
to exchange the colorful diagrams which
can be in your aims examination that's
what happening from the last one year or
last six months of last three more so
different batches so you have more
diagram is related discussions and more
diagram is related stuff and if you open
yesterday's examination all then more
than like 10 to 15 diagram based
questions which are going to be the key
role in your aims so if you go in detail
your aims examination will be if ten
marks I mean ten seats and the number of
questions will be ninety and you are
going to have 90 minutes for each
question and minus one-third is negative
okay that's very key important rule
because your need is minus 1/4 negative
and your aims is minus one-third
negative however it's very clear right
so the next important aspect is each
question is I mean lucky you need to
solve each question in one minute of
course you need to go over a two round
of two round examination why you're
swallowing the question paper so you
should finish each question in 50
seconds and of course there are lengthy
questions they will build and the
questions in your aims examination when
you compare with me because need
majority of the questions will be single
liners or two liners maximum whereas you
know a majority of the questions will be
more than two lines more than three
lines so you need to you need to plan
you need to plan a quad and you need to
have a good practice of reading the
stuff on the desktop and understanding
the things as fast as possible because
you how in and around like 50 to 52 or
55 seconds for each question in your
aims examination Hawkes
that's a slight difference from your
date whereas coming to diagram based
questions on already discuss there will
be 25 to 30 diagram based questions and
regular questions will be just 60 to 65
so all these are going to play a greater
impact and that's what the basic
difference between the aims and the need
exam and what you need to focus is very
simple 90 percent is of your questions
mostly on clinicals according to the
last six to seven years per person
Alice's and 80 percentage of these
clinical questions will be from your
oral surgery in specific and cons and/or
Parian or thorne Pedro so particularly
you need to focus more on implants
and/or no medicine oral pathology so
apart from these you can add deh and
general a note because I have seen many
questions related to these two subjects
and of course you have to add that your
materials to this and out of these 25 to
30 M diagram has questions most of the
questions 1995 percentage of questions
will be clinical based and the special
topic special subject that we need to
consider by going ahead with oral
surgery in specific teams they have few
topics that are very very important
which are not covered in your basic
books what we you are reading so these
are the few topics that you need to
focus on when you're dealing with exams
like your aims okay the main topic I
feel like is focusing on golden hour and
focusing on basic life support focusing
on life-saving procedures life-saving
drugs life-saving equipments or tubes
XYZ which are there in your ICU
medically compromised really related to
medically compromised patients and
medical management of patient all the
dental chase these these are the few
aspects of of course you need to focus
more on the factual management of both
maxilla mandible even you can add a note
about the plastic surgery so these are
the important aspects that you need to
cover in the oral surgery which are not
the basic books okay basic books
subject is mandatory apart from these
you need to cover these subjects because
you will find very limited questions on
basic life support if you open your
regular base you can stick your book
okay so these are a few important topics
that you need to pare down coming to the
intro'd onyx again it's an important
subject and an important area where the
allowed to ask questions that I want you
guys to spend much of your time with
your rotary endodontics because I have
seen many questions and
as a media student I feel like we are we
are unaware of this or rotary I don't
excite I've seen many questions related
to rock render down to its basics as
well as the advances on that recent
classification so you need to focus on
rotary neurotics one and regular you
need to go with the regular stance you
need to go with your PPE to go with your
tentative pulse and all the groups
related stuff back from this I want you
guys to add a note on emptying at least
in modifications in empty a recent
modifications in irrigation solution
recent modifications in almost all the
steps of your anger on ticks and I want
you guys to add a note on bio Denton so
these are the areas where they love to
ask questions and next is goes with
ortho ortho is mostly diagram based
questions you need to learn each and
every instrument that is used by your PG
student just a simple conclusion I can
come with a mix of almost all the
appliances relevant diagrams and their
uses but all the instrument used by the
Bee Gees and their uses so that that's
add-on to auto and coming to the pidove
Fida was recently added branch to your
aims list okay it was added one year
back one one out of here back so now
they are focusing more on the PDO based
I want you guys to focus more on shale
psychology and la Pira in combination
with author and just go ahead with your
PP books because PP Books has covered
many of the diagram based questions and
they're very important if you plan to go
ahead try to cover the diagrams that are
present in the material textbook because
I have seen many aims related questions
directly taken from this particular book
please try to focus on the tables and
the charts argument in the mentor and if
you have time that's what the pedo is
concerned about and coming to the perio
there are many many things in the video
and I want you guys to just go ahead
with currents diagrams whenever you have
time this open half an hour just just
just turn the pages of current so if you
find anything new just just make it or
because I feel like this is the best way
of making things out and your PP books
are going to add more diagram based
questions because there are two or three
diagram has questions it should diet
course direct Peaks from your PP if they
have new questions too
but they're already there in your power
play books that's what the I'd want is
because power play books Perry apart was
directly taken and prepared from
Carranza all the important points all
the important tables all the important
diagrams which an Uzi is unaware is
collected and it is precise in your
power levels in the form of paleo so I
want you guys to finish the video baby
words which are directly or indirectly
going to add one extra mark but compared
to your competitors in video so coming
to the prosthetics prosthetics I feel
like you need to focus more on 1/2 PD ok
don't go for all high fat X boxes stick
onto your nano so me just just just turn
the pages with a decent look or diagram
based questions which are like if you
feel this is new thing
just have a look just diagram is yes a
diagram and one or two points relevant
to the stuff just add on and learn what
is the appliance what is the class what
is the condition what is this what is
this instrument
what is the use of this expert so just
go with the basic stuff even I mean like
they may ask new thing but it's very
easy thing if you just go with the basic
test but don't go for - textbooks as
many of the mental studies we are not a
graduation level just this if we listen
like peasy okay I accept it we had an
undergraduate okay just go with your
knowledge for me don't go for all hyper
things so me is a very recent book
that's going to cover a majority of your
diagram where's questions and majority
of the things that are necessary for
aims and relevant to Proust and of
course implants is one of the golden
thing that you need to make a note
whether it is aims or whether it is need
or whether it is XYZ exam implant is
mandatory because implant is the latest
strength that is coming into the market
and allowed to ask questions and implant
you need to feed from honest but you
need to clean the implant from
prosthetic aspects surgical Aspen and
Parador class but all aspects each and
every aspect of implant was decently
covered in your PP books into three
parts source periodontal surgery is
related to the implants indications
contraindications at what is
disadvantages one-step surgery and
two-step so it's really how the steps
goes and what are the things all all
numericals related to the periodontal
aspect were you're covered in your
implants part apart from this the
prosthetic part that I mentions
resistance from anatomic
Mark's different types of implants how
you can identify each type of implant
what are the complications of your plan
XYZ related to the implants and implant
material is of course titanium each and
every point of titanium were covered in
your dental materials each and every
point to the calculations and the
measurements were covered in the
prosthetic part in each and every field
like surgery but covered in the
penetentary part all these are very
important and going to add two or three
marks apart from these the anatomy
related to the implants that is t1 t2 t3
t4 t5 what are these poles what are
these densities where are they present
all these stuff or the basic stuff which
are very very very very important in the
implants aspect so apart from this there
are many other things that we are going
to add on in your groups okay a few
things that we should not keep on the
regular social media there are very
other things which are very important
and we'll be adding in specific in your
regular groups okay we will be dealing
that further so what what you need to do
must do okay which is my my point of
preparation is always in focus with it I
don't want anyone to completely do Ames
Ames is important but need is more
important Ames is okay but MEAP is very
very important so almost all your
preparations must do so everything will
be a drift towards Ames but mainly
focusing on your need so pp books are
mandatory because majority of the PP
books were prepared from the basic text
books okay so you can encounter any new
thing if two or three questions from PP
box textbook reading textbook scientists
names and expedited numerical steps book
related tale will stress related
flowcharts that's good letter diagrams
can definitely add on the to your to
your scores that's going to make a
difference in exams like aims right so
people books are mandatory for aims
exams and second thing textbook reading
is of course going to play a very vital
role because two or three questions new
questions from textbook if you are going
ahead with textbook reading that's going
to have an additional advantage in exams
like aims as well as need and of course
anteus conquer has an upper hand compact
rest of the people because we focus more
on textbook reading it's not like
blindly reading the whole chapter that's
bigoted about reading things which can
be converted into school because the
matters here are very dedicated that we
textbook underlined the textbook and
that they cover the the convert that
into note says they convert that into
paper will say and few times if it is
like very new thing advanced thing will
just post the directive from the
textbook with underlined highlighter and
that's what we are doing it regular
offline Center and off lines and we have
more textbook reading regular stuff is
going in other side and another side we
are going with more textbook reading
that is very very important in
examinations like aims and need to show
that margin of upper hand when compared
to your competitor because pants
question okay 90 percent as people they
go with right PP question 20 percentage
of people will will go right whereas
stuff that is discussed on the group 5
to 10 15 % less stuff discussed all the
offline Center 5 to 10 percentage of
people and the textbook reading is again
going to have a greater impact that's
going to create some advantage over your
computer so I want you guys to have a
decent textbook reading at least this
term that is being posted on your groups
and XY check and of course time factor
you need to consider your time cume like
for example if you have like plan you
have 10 hours per day for preparation
give two hours to me get eight hours to
your to two hours to your aims and eight
hours to your need preparation neat
means need is going to include aims but
aims and majority of the times may not
enter because diagram is questions are
like learning a diagram based question
is more important for aims but learning
a diagram based question with some sort
of synopsis is important for your need
examination that's what the smarter work
that we need to do when you are drifting
towards the aims for this upcoming one
or two months right and of course
practice because aims I said make it
some action it's imagined means what to
go and what to leave is again important
because how many questions you attempt
how many questions you should leave how
we need to attend and because it's a
negative based examination negative
marking is there
nation's methods there are many other
methods that you need to implement when
you're going ahead and we're solving the
particular mcq because every mcq is
going to create a greater impact for
example Frank 6 or rank 7 or rank 8 you
may or may not end up with the seat so
even if you get a rank 8 or rank 80 or
rank 800 or 8000 it does not make any
difference you are not going to end up
with the C so you should be in the top
finalists further you need to be more
accurate so that you need to be you need
to have more practice multiple Direction
practice of course our online site is
providing more than 200 all-purpose fart
knobs and probably it will be increasing
to 300 before you give your ends
examination there will be lots of
practice and we are planning to have a
specific diagram based examination for
each subject at specific diagram based
class for in subsidy or offline Center
properly we're planning to upload those
videos in the online too but I'm not
sure about that I will be updating in
furthering people who are in and around
high level please try to attend your
offline classes to go ahead with the
dragon based discussion of em's we're
planning like every clinical subject you
will be having a diagram based this
question of two hours of class in an
offline Center satisfies probably that
they attend their own timetable and the
shuttle will be out within five or six
days so of course the stress management
MBS conquer is best in reducing your
stresses with different strategies and
everything find stress for us to talk
with a friend talk with them and just go
with the song and try to manage your
stress because stress management is
again an important area of a majority of
us we go zero and coming to the
scheduling of course are the the new
shuttle was already posted in the group
and I hope these PDFs were already
posted on the route this is what this is
what the subject wise analysis I want
you guys to Q rating out of 10 and
number of revisions and just add some
remarks and according to that in our
offline Center we are planning an
individual
timetable for every every person aw like
ice today we've got 60 65 odd plus
symbol and Santa that was the highest
one 10 bucks
often Center was opened just two months
back and now the strength is almost like
6065 it's a good thing so we are having
an individual subject analysis and
individual time table for everyone okay
precise timetable for everyone this is
what the things and this is what the
schedule for the upcoming weekend
it varies to individual individual
people who are started now you can you
can just focus on parts whether it is
part one part two and part three you can
just focus on these parties and you can
spend like two hours two hours two hours
six hours people who are spending six
hours you can convert this part 1 to 2
hours part 2 to 2 hours and party people
who are working like 9 hours you can
cover part 1 3 part 2 3 and part part 3
3 and people who are spending more time
now it was already the command was given
I was asking like intends to quit the
preparation and focus more on the
preparation now people are spending 13
14 and 15 hours and often people of
course 90 percentage of length people
are spending more than 13 hours per day
with the boots in offline center so
that's a positive sign so for 13 I was
sort of 14 hours you need to have a
decent overlooked aspect okay this is
what the aspect people who have started
preparation now they can focus on the
parts and people who are already
starting the preparation they have a
different aspect okay 30 minutes for
every pharmacology classification every
day from from today and you can go with
the part one with a regular schedule
that is there you know the headings I
mean the chapters are the area of pulse
and you can add two hours people who
have time you can add two hours for the
subject old revision basing upon the
subject vise analysis where the rating
is less where the revisions are less you
can add that particular subject and just
go ahead with the revision for every two
I mean like every day you can spend two
hours with this and the regular part two
you can just go ahead and every day one
hour I want you guys to solve one online
paper and preferably in the time of need
examination that is 2 to 6 in and around
like 2 to 6 I want you guys to spend 1
over with your own land papers are
available outside and go with the part 3
every day 1 hour
whenever you have time spend 10 pages of
pee-pee you need to cover every day you
need to cover 10 to 15 pages of pee-pee
and part four is revision okay make a
note I want you guys to finish 2017 and
2018 I'm sick use as fast as possible
okay two or three books available in the
market just just finish them as fast as
possible because and then don't keep
these stuff back then because they are
very very important because and we can
encounter few repeats from these books
from these 5% MCQs and of course these
questions are directly or indirectly
discussed in the group and they are
given in the form of PP or given in the
form of your PDF so they're given in the
form of your
mcq so you know no need to worry but I
want you guys to finish this as fast as
possible just just will go with the
rough scheduling just go with half an
hour
pharmacology classification deciduous
dentition people who are initially
starting against cover in two hours
revision can be done in one hour and
people who are slow readers and spending
much time you can finish this in three
hours okay just go with the old revision
people who are in the first term second
round the third round efficiency let's
go with the old revision subject and you
can cover the development of two
personal astrology part and one hour you
can focus on all n purpose enamel
installed you can be done pp books ten
pages of the TA or th can be started
just go ahead with the revision this is
a rough plan and you need to modify
according to your comfort because there
will be housewives there will be people
who are working in the Phoenix there
will be people who has kids to take care
so they may not spend much of the time
with the books okay six hour seven hours
is acceptable for such people and the
second category is let people who are
awful and places people who are far away
from homes people who are in the
colleges interns
quitting the college and preparing for
the full time people who are like
working more than 14 hours 15 hours like
I've seen individuals who are working
for 16 17 and 18 - but if you are more
than 14 you can just follow this
schedule it's light out for addition if
you're already done with your few people
they're very good at reading they're
very fast leaders and they can complete
all the th in one or two days so you can
plan another subject so such people can
be
me impersonal just fill this subject
vise analysis paper we can have a
precise individual schedule for each
other that's what the speciality of MDS
conquers focusing on each and every
individual and like few people they go
read fast they go for us they learn they
learn fast they have more time so such
people will be on the upper hand and
people who has less time it's always
like not on the upper hand the lower
hand it's almost like give your best
shot if your mother - working - I was
give you a best shot if your intern
working four or six hours give your best
shot if your clinician don't have time
spending one hour give your best shot I
mean like working depends upon multiple
factors so fact from time that many
other factors are going to play a very
vital role I finish this off very fast I
finished the whole syllabus within three
or four hours and the same stuff my
friend used to take more than one or two
days so don't come back okay they are
working 14 hours a day lovers is 14
hours idle hour 6:15 know and not idle
it's not ideal
I did a idle thing is like completing
your task on time idle thing is like
giving your best shot
idle thing is like keeping MDS
preparation as priority one if you're
doing these things you know you're going
in a perfect it's not about like 14
overseas idle time or 15 hours is idle
time how we need to segregate time I'm
not giving my best shot a few enters a
yesterday when I was posted this slide
on the roof we are we'll just working
six hours how how can we man know you've
got six hours give your best shot few
people max they can work on it 24 hours
24 hours it's it's impossible because a
day is 24 hours so max is 24 hours so
don't go within relevant closet don't
compare your preparation with some XYZ
preparation I hope you guys have matured
majority of us are interns done with our
intention of course it's 24 25 + s and
we have that maturity level of
understanding don't come back with your
life to individual life or your
preparation to others preparation no
marks to other marks your rang to other
months we will be comparing this in the
final exam know what you are today and
what you are tomorrow what you are on
the day one
of MDS conquer and what you are now what
you are going to be it's a comparison of
you with you after a generation of em
it's not like compassion okay my friend
kita
she got all India first and right now
she was in Mawlana EC is sending you any
sort of further every month - at least
ten thousand your good friend no no one
do that and and it's not going to happen
for sure okay so no one is going to
share their success no one is going to
share with your failure it's you that
you are going to share your success and
failure max the next influenced person
may be your affairs according to the
radius of actions so just focus on what
you are doing okay so that's what guys
if you have any personal doubts crash
course is going to start on September 19
2018 I mean like it's not a promotional
sort of video it's morally precise to
MDS conquer students okay main focus is
emptiness converse students we don't
have a better way of posting lnb
high-definition videos so we have choose
our youtube channel the mainly this
video is for MBAs conquer so these are
the peaks of our offline Institute and
things are going very fine and decent as
per the schedule I am very happy for
that okay so these are the library and
it is about the class and thank you guys

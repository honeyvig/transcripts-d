what's really cool now in in Visual
Studio 2022 is that we have made it such
that you can take any visual studio and
vs code color theme and convert that to
a Visual Studio color theme very easily
and there's a bunch of these available
out on the extension Marketplace and I
want to just show you a few right here
so go to tools
theme and you can choose from any of the
themes that you've got installed of
course you get some out of the box with
Visual Studio you can choose from
and you can always go and say click for
get more themes and that will get you to
the marketplace where you can install
all these different themes there's so
many great ones in here they really help
us if we want a nice Dark theme if we're
sitting in a dark room for instance and
we can even have Visual Studio change
the theme automatically when Windows
changes its theme there's this thing
here called use system setting and when
we do that if if Windows is running in a
dark theme at night for instance after
Sunset Visual Studio will automatically
switch to the Dark theme at that point
in time and back to the light theme at
Sunrise if that's your Windows settings

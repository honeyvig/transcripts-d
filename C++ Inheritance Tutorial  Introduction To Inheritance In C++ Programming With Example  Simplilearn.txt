hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn this is harsh
bharadwaj and today we will learn about
c plus plus inheritance so without
further ado let's get started so in this
session we will learn about what is c
plus plus inheritance why do we use
inheritance in c plus plus then we will
understand different modes of
inheritance and after that we will learn
about types of inheritance that is
single inheritance multiple inheritance
multi-level inheritance and hybrid
inheritance in c plus but before we
begin make sure to subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update so what is inheritance in
c plus just like a child inherits the
behavior and characteristics from his or
her parents similarly inheritance in c
plus plus is a process in which the
derived class acquires all the
properties and characteristics from the
parent class that is the base class
derived class is also known as child
class and base class is also known as
parent class
inheritance is one of the most important
feature of c plus plus hoops that is
object-oriented programming in
inheritance there are two types of
classes the class which inherits the
properties and behavior from the base
class is known as derived class and the
class whose properties or
characteristics are inherited is called
a base class
now let's understand why we use
inheritance in c plus
inheritance is used in c plus because it
increases the reusability of the code
and it helps in removing the redundancy
to understand it let's suppose there are
two classes two wheeler and four wheeler
both of the classes contain similar
functions
like color brand and mileage now if we
create these classes we have to create
all the three functions in both of the
classes or in other words we have to
write the same code two times in both of
the classes so instead of writing that
code again and again we can use
inheritance and create a parent class
named class vecal and both of the two
wheeler and the four variable classes
will be inherited from this parent or
base class now with inheritance we have
inherited both the classes from one base
class that is class cycle now we no
longer have to write the code again and
again and we can simply write the
functions once in the base class as both
of these classes are inherited from the
base class cycle so as we have
understood about inheritance in c plus
plus and why we use inheritance in c
plus plus so now let's go ahead and
learn about
modes of inheritance there are three
modes of inheritance in c plus that is
public mode protected mode and private
mode of inheritance so let's start with
the public mode in this mode of
inheritance the public members of base
class remains public in derived class
and same goes for the protected members
that means inside the base class the
class members that are public will
remain public in the derived class and
similarly protected class members will
remain protected in derived class
now protected mode in the protected mode
the public and protected members of the
base class will become protected in the
derived class that means the class
members which are public or protected in
the base class will all become protected
in the derived class in the private mode
of inheritance protected and public
members of class will become private in
the derived class so now let's go ahead
to the types of inheritance so there are
various types of inheritance in c plus
plus that is single inheritance multiple
inheritance multi-level inheritance
hierarchical inheritance and hybrid
inheritance so let's start with the
single inheritance in this type of
inheritance a single derived class is
inherited from the single base class it
allows the derived class to inherit
properties and behavior from the parent
class the derived class objects can
access the members of the base class but
the base class objects cannot access the
members of the derived class so now
let's have a look at the syntax as we
know this is single inheritance so there
will be only a single derived class and
a single base class and this is how we
derive a child class from a parent class
class keyword then the name of the
derived class then the colon operator
after that there is an axis modifier
with the base class now as we have
understood about single inheritance and
its syntax now let's move on to multiple
inheritance multiple inheritance when a
class inherits from more than one base
class or multiple base classes then it
is known as multiple inheritance it
allows us to inherit properties and
characteristics from more than one base
class
syntax for multiple inheritance is class
keyword with the name of derived class
then the colon operator and access
modifier with the name of the base class
separated with comma and the name of
another base class here we have shown
only two base classes but we can make
more than two base classes depending
upon our requirement now coming to
multi-level inheritance in this type of
inheritance the derived class is
inherited from another derived class
that means when a class extends a class
that further extends another class is
known as multi-level inheritance for
example if there are three classes a b c
and class c is inherited from class b
and class b is inherited from class a
then it can be called as a multi-level
inheritance syntax of multi-level
inheritance is as follows base class 2
is derived from base class 1 and the
derived class is derived from base class
2. these base class 1 base class 2 and
derived class are just the names not a
syntax you can write whichever name you
want with the class
now let's learn about hierarchical
inheritance in this type of inheritance
more than one class is inherited from a
single base class that is there would be
a single base class and multiple derived
classes
which have the properties and features
same as that of the base class as we can
see in the figure and in the syntax the
derived class 1 is derived from base
class and similarly derived class 2 and
derived class 3 are also derived from
the base class
so this was hierarchical inheritance and
our next type of inheritance would be
hybrid inheritance the hybrid
inheritance is the combination of more
than one type of inheritance and it can
be said that it is a combination of
multi-level and hierarchical inheritance
in the figure we can see the base class
1 is the parent class of derived class 1
and derived class 1 is the parent class
of derived class 3 which makes it
multi-level inheritance but if you look
at it in this way that the base class 1
is the parent class of derived class 1
derived class 2 and derived class 3 then
it is hierarchical inheritance as
multiple classes are inherited from a
common base class so we can say it is a
combination of more than one type of
inheritance or a hybrid inheritance so
as we have understood about inheritance
in c plus so now let's go to its
practical aspect and do some examples on
our code editor that is vs code so this
is our visual studio code and now we
will do an example of inheritance we'll
start by doing the single inheritance
example in which we will make a parent
class and a child class and let's start
first of all we'll create a file and
let's name this file as
let's name it inherit
dot cpp
so here we'll do an example in which you
will create two classes a base class and
a derived class and will create
functions in those classes like we will
create one function in base class and
one function in derived class and using
the object of derived class we will
access the member of parent class or
base class so let's start first of all
we will include the header files
hash include iostream
now the name space standard using name
space
std
now we'll create a base class first then
afterwards we'll create the main
function
all right so
let's create the base class
let's say the name of the base class or
the parent class would be
beverage and inside this class let's
make the scope public and
now let's create a function
as we have said
drinks
so this is a function and we will print
something inside this function so let's
say we are printing
all rings are available
all drinks
are available
now i will write endl now
we will use semicolon in the end of the
class so this is our base class and we
have created a function drinks and we
have printed a message all drinks are
available
all right now we will create another
class which is derived class or child
class
we will write
class
coffee is the
name of the derived class we use the
column operator public access specifier
and the name of
the base class that is beverage all
right now we'll write public access
specifier inside this class and we will
create a function
in this class also like let's say the
name of the function would be mocha
it is a kind of a coffee so mocha and
we will print that
mokka tastes good
tastes the best i would say
okay
now
let's use the color operator in the end
of the class so we here we have created
the parent class or base class and this
derived class of child class
so now we will create the main function
where we'll do the calling
so now we will create the object of
child class
so our child class is coffee
and
now we will create the object that is c
the name of the class and the object
okay now we will use the object with dot
operator and call this function that is
drinks
and now using the same object we'll call
the
mocha the spelling is wrong yeah now it
is right
mocha
so using the object of child class here
we are calling the drinks function which
is of the parent class
so
let's see if it works or not let's save
it and now run it
as you can see all drinks are available
and mocha taste the best
both of these are getting printed that
means the
object of child class is able to access
the member of the parent class
so this is inheritance when the child
class
acquires or inherits the behavior or
characteristics from a parent class or
access the members of the parent class
this is an example of single inheritance
so now let's do another example of
multiple inheritance
so let's create a new file
and name it as inherit two dot cpp all
right now here we'll do an example of
multiple inheritance in which we will
create two base classes and a derived
class as we know that in multiple
inheritance there are more than one base
classes to a single derived class
so let's start first of all we'll
include the header file now we'll use
the namespace standard
and now we will create a class that is
the base class
and we'll name it as party so class
party inside this base class we will
first of all declare the public scope
and now we will declare a variable let's
say meals
so now we will create a function and in
this function we will take the input
from the user about the number of mails
to enter the number of meals
so
let's start void
food this is the function name and first
of all we'll display the message
saying that
enter
number of meals
all right now
we will take the input
and meals
is the variable
now we will use the semicolon at the end
of this class
so in this
function we are taking the input of the
number of meals now in this in the other
class that is another base class we will
take the input of number of drinks from
the users and then in the derived class
we figure out the total bill of the
party
all right now
we'll create another base class
that is drinks
not drinks
drinks
all right
now
we'll write the public scope
and similarly we'll create
or declare another variable drink
and
then now we will create a function let's
say the name of the function is liquor
all right now inside this function we
will take the input from the user
regarding the number of drinks
so
we'll display the message
enter
the number of drinks
so
the user will enter the total number of
drinks used in the party or consumed in
the party similarly goes for the meals
now we will take the
input
and we'll write drink
drink all right
now we have created this liquor function
now we will use the semicolon at the end
of the class here we have created both
the base classes that is class party and
class strings
now we have to create the derived class
so this is example of multiple
inheritance so
we will create
the derived class
and use the
column operator now we will write the
public specifier and the name of the
base class first base class would be
party
separated with comma the second base
class would be drinks
all right so this is how we can do that
now inside this class we will first of
all create three variables
let's say
hint
total
meals
in
total
drinks
and int
total
bill because in the end we have to find
out the total bill all right
now
inside the public scope
we will create a function name as total
now inside this total function we'll
write the logic to calculate the total
bill
so what we'll do is first of all write
the total meal
total meals
equals meals
into the price of a single meal let's
say the price of a single meal is 90.
so the total product would be stored in
total meals
all right now
we will do
same for total drinks
total drinks not frank's equals
drink
into
let's say the price of a single drink is
60
yes all right
now after that we have to compute or
calculate the total bill
total bill would be
the addition of both of these total
meals plus total rates so we'll simply
do the addition over here
total drinks
so once it's calculated we'll simply
display a message saying that the total
bill for the party
total
bill for the party is
and we'll write the variable that is
total bill where the total
bill is actually getting stored all
right after this we will use the
semicolon so this is the derived class
here we have calculated the total money
spent in the party
so now we have to write the main
function where it all started
inside the main function
first of all we will create the
object of child class so we know that
our child class or the derived class is
bill so bill is the derived class and b
would be the object so using this b we
will first of all call a function
that is
food function
so by calling this we will take the
input of number of meals now we will
call another function
named liquor
all right using this function calling
this function will take the number of
drinks from the user
now we will call this total function
so this will calculate the total money
spent in the party
and after that let's say return zero
we are calling all of these functions
using the object of derived class and
this is where multiple inheritance is
going on so let's see whether it works
or not we will save it and we'll try to
run this
enter number of meals as you can see
enter number of meals let's say the
number of meals would be 20 it was a
short party then enter number of drinks
17 would be so our total bill for the
party is 3 2 7 0 which is the correct
answer so this is how we can do multiple
inheritance and this is a fine example
of multiple inheritance now let's do
another example so let's name this one
as
inherit
three dot cpp
all right so here we will do an example
of multi-level inheritance and we know
that in multi-level inheritance a single
derived class is inherited from another
derived class
or in other words we can say a class
extends a class which further extends
another class then it is called a
multi-level inheritance as the name
suggests
so
we will do example of that in this
example we will calculate the marks of a
student scored by him in three subjects
we will calculate the total marks scored
by him
using multi-level inheritance so let's
do this
so first of all we will
include the header file hash include i
string then we will write the name space
standard
now we will create the class
base class
chemistry
all right in this class
first of all we will make the public
scope
and
marks one so here we will take the input
of marks code by
that particular child in this chemistry
subject so we'll create the chemistry
function white chemistry this is of same
name as that of class so let's take
mystery marks
all right now
we will display the marks code in
chemistry
enter the marks
scored in
chemistry
spelling is wrong okay now we'll take
the input
marks one so the student will enter the
marks after that
let's put semicolon in the end now we'll
create another class named physics
which is inherited from chemistry class
that is chemistry class is its base
class
chemistry
all right so
in this class
we will do the same
public and
marks 2 print marks 2
now we'll write void
physics marks
we'll do the same as we have done in the
previous class
so now we will
display a message saying that
enter the marks
code in
physics
all right
now we will take the input c in
max2 all right so now we will put
semicolon in the end of this class as
well so now we know that this physics
class is is inherited from this
chemistry class that is the chemistry
class is the base class of physics class
now
we'll do same for maths like class
maths
which is in
inherited
from the
physics class
we'll write physics
inside this class as well we'll do the
same and
as you can see this physics class is the
base class of maths and the base class
of physics class is chemistry so this is
a multi-level inheritance
so in this class we'll do the same
public scope and now after public scope
hint marks three is the variable we have
declared
and we will declare another variable in
this one like total because we have to
find out the total marks
now function maths
marks
inside this one we will display the
message
that enter
the marks yeah enter
the
marks
scored in
maths all right now we'll take the input
marks three and we'll write the
semicolon in the end so here we have
created all of these three classes which
is of multi-level inheritance as you can
see
we have taken the input from the
user of its maths physics and chemistry
marks now
we'll do the total so
we have to do the total inside this
class only so the name would be
result function
so
the total
func variable that we have declared
is equal to max 1
max 2 plus
max 3 so physics commission maths marks
we will add all of them
and then we will display the total
all right
now this is done now we have to go to
the main function
now first of all we will create the
object of child class maths
once this object is created now we can
call the functions as it can access
the base classes
so
chemistry marks first of all then
m dot
physics
marks
m dot maths marks
and then the total that is result result
function m dot
result then we'll write return 0
so
return 0. so here first of all m dot
commission marks will call this function
in the chemistry class so the user will
enter the marks code by him in chemistry
then this will call physics marks so the
user will enter the marks code by him in
physics subject then similarly we will
match marks they will enter the marks of
max then we will call the result
function we will do the total of all the
marks scored by the student we will do
the total and then we will display that
total so pretty much it's done now we
can save it and now let's try to run
this one there are some errors
all right that's a silly one
by mistake we have done this
all right now let's save it and run it
again hope it works now yeah another
error
marks
now let's try again now it's working
fine enter the marks code in chemistry
let's say
80
physics
80
on max's week let's say
75
235 which is the right answer 80 plus 80
plus 75 is equal to 235 and
using the object of child class we have
called the functions of all of these
base classes like we have called this
chemistry marks function and this
physics marks function which is of base
class and this was a fine example of
multi-level inheritance and this is how
we can
do multi-level inheritance so these were
some examples of c plus plus inheritance
you can try some more examples on it and
these were some decent examples to
understand it better you can start with
some basic level examples then go to the
intermediate level all right guys with
that we have come to the end of this

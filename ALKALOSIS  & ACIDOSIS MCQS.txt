hi everyone today we are going to fall
to a vertical which are very important
in the examination bond of me which are
mostly ask questions most common last
question that is related to the
respiratory alkalosis and Method oh okay
I feel as we're dental students we are
like we are not much concerned towards
these concepts in topics but final thing
is like we need to solve the question
with greater accuracy because time
duration for each person will be in the
range of 40 to 50 seconds so we need to
solve these questions as fast as
possible now I am going to give you
hints and techniques how you need to
solve these empty so before going into
the solving process we'll have a good
discussion about what's actually present
topic and what are the few things that
you need to remember in this particular
topic right so before going make the
tropics heading is like acid and base
reaction right so this is the reaction
that kinetics list in the blood and it's
going to play a very vital role in
answering the pH and bringing it back to
normal
and acting as a buffer okay means
buffering is nothing but the smoothening
process okay in simple language but
before so the patients coming to the pH
of the blood the normal pH of the blood
as we know that is 7.3 hi 27.45 so
whenever there's peace and increasing in
these values whenever there it is
increasing the pH value a simple reduce
for definite alkalosis whenever there is
decrease in the pH value it is not ever
thank you know
simple simple language okay so Mulder
like that what you need to know
regarding the normal blood gas values a
few things that you need to remember so
what values you need to remember coming
to the values that you need to remember
the blood values one in pH already
discussed 7.35 to 7.45 next is
bicarbonate ion concentration which is
22 to 26 milli : to score later so the I
feel like these are the two things that
are much important for solving an
institute in the examination hall rather
there are many other values that you can
remember and few among them are the
parts from the my coordinate value which
is the range of 20 to the rotating you
need to remember the H+ ion
concentration that is 40 whole per liter
so apart from these there are partial
pressure of oxygen which is going to be
750 200mm of 50 and partial pressure of
carbon dioxide which will be in the
range of 35 to 45 mm of Hg so these are
the few values that you need to remember
for according to me these are the two
values which are more important rather
than the whole okay
the next movie like
what are the diagonals we have four
options in every question of this
metabolic acidosis an algorithm we have
four options we are going to discuss
these four options right now so one is
axial doses and second one is alkalosis
okay so before going to this I want to
give some good information okay this is
very very useful one
so the basic things that what is going
to happen the blood is like carbon
dioxide which is present in the blood is
going to react with the blood nothing
but water in it so it's going to form
h2co3 that is carbonic acid so charge I
am going to dissociate into H+ ion which
is hydrogen ion plus let's see what ray
- that is by Harkonnen this equation is
very very important and I want to make
it very simple okay very simple that
think imagine that this H+ even acid and
this by coordinate as a base whenever
there is increasing in the h plus R
means acid the pH is going to be
decreased so these are inversely
proportional whenever there is
increasing in the face the pH is going
to increase these are directly
proportional because in the language so
let's move to the restenosis and
alkalosis if you go in detail it reduces
to discuss whenever there is decreasing
the pH alkalosis whenever there is
increasing the pH underneath for G be of
two types
so one is metabolic and second one is
respiratory one is metabolic and second
one is respirator right so always
correlate these things with C would
60 moto is involved there is going to be
a spreader always compare he will do
with respiratory and bicarbonate with
metabolic okay so how they apply these
concepts will be very clear it is called
few M jitters
so one more code allow this code
actually so one more code behind this is
M and B so what is M and B actually very
simple M and B you remember it so M is
nothing but metabolic and D is nothing
but directly proportional so whenever
there we two increments like pH fancy
voltage it leads to increment R in the
same direction
so whenever there is increase in pH and
whenever there is increasing this
devotee so it is directly proportional
so it is directly proportional so its
metabolic so these values given
information is related to the metabolic
right and there is increase in the pH so
it is metabolic alkalosis clear so
second value is like whenever they be
decreasing in the previous value as well
as decreasing this devotees I think they
are directly proportional so again it is
metabolic and it's going to be decreased
so it is extra dose with that so clear
so opposite okay whenever it is
inversely proposed that actly proportion
it is metabolic whenever it is inversely
proportional
so the inversely proportional is
desperate
so when I was very decreasing in the
preheat and increasing the sea water it
is respiratory decrease in spectral
whenever there is increasing in the pH
and decreasing in the sea volume it is
again respiratory and it is alcohol I
told like always whenever there is
respiratory remember the co2 value it
logically works here whenever there is
increasing the co2 value means more
address so there will be decreasing
Romanian so it works in a correct way
whenever you consider respiratory
related to the carbon dioxide I think I
hope you guys are clear of the Tees
values and the concepts behind this okay
so now we are going to solve umcg
related this which are taken from the
previous examination coming to the first
question the primary increase in the
carbon dioxide in the body it seen in
the case of wherever their reasoning
leading in the carbon dioxide value I
told there will be decreasing the pH
right so whenever this happened this
happened logically carbon dioxide I told
you guys to remember it as respirator so
increasing in the co2 decreases the pH
means pH is decreased so it is explosive
it can be any of these a surface so it
is related to the carbon dioxide it is
called as a respiratory clear first
question it's all coming to the second
question we are the investigation gas
values of an individual who's on
ventilation and shows the values like
decreasing in the partial pressure of
carbon dioxide
okay and normal photo and the pH is 7
point 7
okay just note the piece is 7 point 5 it
is
alkalosis right so you can remove these
options acidosis as does is very much so
number can be either a or P and you need
to identify whether this is related to
the metabolic or whether it is related
to the respiratory the next star
okay so thing is like whenever P zero
two values of decrease mean acid is
decreasing so the pH value has to
increase and yes it is increased so
definitely it is related to the carbon
dioxide levels because the equation is
balanced so it is respiratory again
because it is related to the carbon
dioxide - sorry we see what - PP water
right so it is related to the carbon
dioxide so the answer is respiratory
introduced sorry respiratory alkalosis
transferring a - coming to the third
question a female patient after an
injury come to the cashew ality and her
samples are like this clearly given the
pH is decreasing so you can remove
whenever the pH is decreasing the answer
can be hazardous so you can remove the
option X and option B clear so it can be
is at B or C and you have to identify
whether it is related with the
respiratory or whether it is related to
the metabolic okay we apply this MD code
here okay almost you lose that directly
solve an easy way of solving whenever
there is decreasing in the pH values
right it should be related to the
respiration carbonised of the have given
the carbon dioxide values are increasing
with acid is increasing so the pH should
be clearer
the other P which is decreased and p0
values are in there so it is related to
the respiratory again so it is
respiratory instead of this node here so
the next question again the sample q 7.2
pH which is less than the normal means
it is extra dose clear and the there is
an information that both the pco2 values
decrease okay the pco2 value decrease as
well as this decreases okay
both the people presume the PP one to
values and decreasing in that thank you
agree - I am values clear so just just
make it as very simple whenever there is
decreasing in the pco2 values
okay there is a small correction here
pco2 value is increased whereas the
y-coordinate value is details okay it
was not printed so whenever there is
increasing in the pc-12 value okay if
you go to value is increased so asset is
increased so the pH should decrease so
it is related to the respiratory so it
is related to the respirator clear and
whenever there is decreasing in this y
coordinate value so whenever my
coordinate buffer is decreased so
reciprocate Li the face appropriating Li
the buffer is decreased so the acid pH
value is going to be decreased because
it is directly proportional decrease the
peopling so the pH values decrease so it
is related to the metal body also
decrease in the pH has diagnosed it as
an integer this both decreasing in the
bicarbonate ion values and increasing in
the pco2 valid has made it respiratory
as well as metabolic the answer is C so
the next question the next question is
the different way different variety of
question the question is they can add a
world like this extra whip it means it
is how it is getting compensated or as
they can ask what is the diagnosis or
they can ask like how it is compensated
for example if it is diagnosed as
metabolic acidosis then it is it will be
compensated in opposite by metabolic
will be replaced by respiratory and it
blows it will be reflexology for example
if it is respiratory acidosis
then it is compensated by metabolic
alkalosis
okay I mean the options are wrong yet if
how we get compensated means a
respiratory so this is compensated by
metabolic alkalosis and a metabolic
alkalosis compensated various
characteristics so it's going to be
offers if the two words are going to
opposite or it is going to be crisscross
then they are asking about the
compensation or whenever they are asking
about the diagnosis that i quess willing
as dying
whenever there was the compensation the
compensation will be upwards into the
two one here which means it is how it is
compensated are meaningless so we go
deep into the question analysis how
gives an information 7.12 means it is
acidosis so it can be acidosis a few
doses as there's no elimination but
logically by compensation is suppose it
cannot be compensated by its losses so
you can eliminate the option C so you
can clearly eliminate the option C and
acidosis cannot be compensated various
doses is an element option D extra doses
cannot be compensated versus you can
tell em that option being simple without
going in detail into the questions by
just analyzing a logical ways of
analyzing a question this is a typical
way of analyzing and cushion by seeing
this option you can just go through the
options and you can come to us answer is
a pusher this is all good right okay so
it is it is just it is definitely it's
done so the pco2 values the pc covers
are well is okay ignore the pco2 value
here okay but take the consideration of
bicornis value the normal by populate
what we have discussed is 22 to 36 and
the pi coordinate value is less here so
whenever the by coordinate value is less
and the ph is less means my quadrant is
less logically pH is less already told
like if they're in the same way
definitely it is because of metabolic
because I have told you in the beginning
that if it is related to the carbonyl
said it will be respiratory if it is
rated to the metabolic
I convert and it will be related to
metabolic stood answer is metabolic
acidosis which will be compensated by
opposite metabolic will be replaced by
respiratory and is low this will be
respect and follow simple okay so the
next last
that investigations have given an
information so I will solve we solve if
there is any chance of eliminating the
question that will close the question
and we'll answer respiratory acidosis
cannot be replaced by a cirrhosis so the
answer is won't be you can eliminate it
and respiratory alkalosis can be reduced
by metabolic acidosis I'm very good it
can be and respiratory acidosis can be
replaced by metabolic alkalosis and
respiratory alkalosis
so the better option is like giving
information regarding the - even this
this is and disperse them but this gives
more information so you can eliminate
this option definitely it can be also
right answer
but this is the best answer always we
need to go for the best answer so it can
be eliminated so this is eliminated
this is eliminated and you're left over
with two options so simple way is like
7.35 is the basic value and the value is
less so it is a two doses so there is
one method OSes option no need to go
deep into the question going with the
values simple way C can be eliminated
now so the answer is a for this question
so how to solve now we are going to
integer so 36 what is the value actually
22 to 25 is all well so this is increase
and the pH is decreased so actually the
bicarbonate value is increasing the pH
should increase so it is not increasing
so the equinox node fit for the
metabolic so the equation is going to be
further respiratory stands there is
respiratory cirrhosis which is going to
be compensated this metabolic alkalosis
okay thank you I hope you enjoyed this
this is all like I just want to make
things very simple I want this is the
heart which is a smart work which makes
or answers the things fast in the
examination because in examination by
accuracy is important obviously but
speed is going to play a very wise
means you need to make this cup very
simple very very simple in fact very
easy because you need to answer each and
every question in just 40 seconds or 45
seconds max so time management is going
to play a very vital role I hope you had
a good time and thank you please try to

so I'm going to show you an extension
here called shifter it allows me to flip
between values and the editor really
really easily let me demonstrate let's
write some CSS let's do background to
Blue and let's do set index four so I
have a keyboard shortcut here Ctrl alt
and then either the up Arrow or down
arrow and so if I'm on a number here
like the Z index and hit Ctrl alt up
it increments the number like this if it
was a 0.08 here
you see it will know to keep those
values depending on the decimals and all
this sort of stuff so really really
handy but we can do more it doesn't have
to be just numbers it could also be
colors so here's the color blue so if I
do control all up I get royal blue
dodger blue
you see here it gets lighter and lighter
the color gets lighter and lighter and
lighter and then it gets darker if I go
down dark blue and so on so forth so I
can flip through these very easily if I
have a hex value like this I can do the
same and it understands what hex is and
it knows it's a color in this case and
so it will make the color darker or
lighter as I either go up or down
with the keyboard shortcuts we can do
other things like switch between true
and false or you know yes and no on off
every time we can toggle between kind of
known values shifter comes in and makes
that super easy for us Ctrl alt up and
down

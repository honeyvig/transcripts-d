I assume that at some level
all technologies
have that capacity to
make something that we
never imagined before.
I'm always trying to work with
things to find out what that is.
What's the secret potential
of this technology?
What can you do
now that you could
never have dreamed
of doing before?
Bloom came out with
a little experiment where it was
just creating a shape
on the screen,
having it expand and disappear.
Really, it was just a
very simple tech demo.
There's something quite charming
about it quite instantly.
The Music X Tech
program is about
empowering artists to create
and experience
music in new ways.
With Peter and Brian,
we had the opportunity to
take their application,
Bloom, into mixed reality.
The first big
difference is scale.
To be in the middle of it is
an entirely
different experience.
This is my first toe in the
water with augmented reality.
I like this thing of still
being in the world with
another experience added to it.
I think it's a bit of
a sense of magic actually.
Being able to actually touch
something in the air and see
it become a real thing
in front of your eyes.
I know how the technology works,
but I still find myself
running off to
these things in the air.
Trying to touch them. They
seem so compelling and solid.
It really is
truly mixed reality.
It's blurring the lines as to
where one starts and one ends.
One of the things I've
always liked with Bloom
is that it gave anyone,
regardless of
any experience of music,
the ability to feel what it's
like to be an improviser.
In this situation, you
are not on your own.
So, you are in a sort
of orchestra here,
rather than being a soloist,
when you have
the app in your hand.
It is quite magical
actually when
the two of you start creating
things in the space around you.
I don't think
anyone's experienced
anything like that
before, actually.

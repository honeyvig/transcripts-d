how's it going my friends I am so
excited to be back here is this on am I
good ok they're giving me thumbs up I'm
excited to be here how you doing my
friend I'm doing great how are you why
don't you introduce yourself my name is
Eric Boyd I lead the AI platform team of
Microsoft so the first question
obviously in the most important that
everyone has for you is are the robots
taking over and how can we become their
friends the robots are totally taking ok
ok no I mean that question is such a
great one to get I've gotten variants of
that and I hear some of these variants
by the way please get your questions in
because I'm sure I've gotten some really
weird questions about AI you know I was
at an onyx conference and onyx is the
open neural network exchange it's
something we work together with Facebook
on and Amazon and NVIDIA and invited the
whole ecosystem in as a way to exchange
you know models from one format to
another but in a space it's a file
format yeah and after sort of talking
about onyx I got a question that was
well have you ever had an onyx model you
know like become self-aware and I'm just
like it's a phone format that's really
not how this stuff works so it was yeah
there's a lot of misunderstandings
around what AI is how it works and you
know what people can do with it and so
that's a lot of what we need to work
through is hey I can do some really
incredible things particularly in the
areas of vision and speech and those
types of areas but you know it's not
sentient it's not self learning like if
you have an AI model that plays chess
really well it's not gonna clean your
floors no I've tried and it made a mess
and my wife got mad yeah that it made a
mess I bet it didn't do it did do
anything so here's here's a question for
those that are out there they're like
because there's a lot of AI they say/i
that all over the place for businesses
out there that are like ok I I think I
need to take advantage of this where are
some good opportunities to start yeah
that's a great question I spend a lot of
time talking to companies about what are
their opportunities and what are the
things they can do you know the the
great thing about AI is it really is
touching and transforming each and every
part of every business and so even like
the feature that we showed today
some of the key notes the Intel Akkad if
you think about that that's such a small
feature in Visual Studio right just
reordering the way that the intellisense
or options come back but they were able
to make that better and and you know by
using AI and having a predictive model
that knows what am i likely to be using
it for they really made Visual Studio
better how much better a half percent
better but if you can do a half percent
across all the different capabilities
you can make so much better and so you
know I was talking to one company it was
a you know a beer manufacturer and I
said well how are you using AI and beer
manufacturing and his answer was we
don't use it at all in the beer
manufacturing we use it in everything
else in logistics in the supply chain
and predicting the inventory that we're
gonna need and pre and forecasting the
prices we're gonna pay all the other
capabilities that they had they were
using AI models and those areas of their
business and so really it's it's that's
what's so interesting to me is just
finding each business and how its gonna
transform each of their businesses and
really challenging companies you need to
have the creativity to figure out how
are you going to actually make your
business better where can a I really
work for you and really learning those
different areas so what is it good smell
humor code smells I don't know where
that term came out it was such a weirdo
know that term it all his code smells
like you're looking at code and you're
like this smells like something we could
fix it or make it better
where are the AI smells so to speak in a
business that you're like hey you know
maybe you should consider using this
program because I consider AI a
programming technique that's right you
know what our good clinic cases for it
if you have something where you know you
are you're applying some rules like the
sorting algorithm and Intelli code right
someone came up with a rule that said
let's sort it alphabetically
you can almost always find an AI
algorithm that's going to predict or do
that better fraud detection is a classic
place where people have rules if we're
get too many requests from this IP
address is probably fraud AI is going to
do fraud production prediction way
better if there are you know financial
forecasts I'm gonna look at these three
things about you know the
the industry or the trends and sort of
project what our finances are gonna look
like a is gonna do that better insurance
industry is getting completely redone if
you think about how insurance works
today they look at five different
factors about your driving history or
your car you have or maybe your
neighborhood and a I can consider ten
thousand factors effectively okay and so
those are things where a is gonna do a
much better job of predicting and so
yeah those are all things that smell
like a I would do well in it so tell me
about the requirement the data
requirement for a I like cuz a lot look
I've had people come up to me be like
hey just do some AI and I'm just like
well can you give me some data why is
data such an important element of AI
yeah one of the first things I talked to
companies about when I meet with them is
if you don't have differentiated data
you don't have differentiated AI so what
is the thing that you have that's
special and unique about your business
that's gonna make your business and your
product better and so you know if a
company is not collecting that today and
a lot of companies I've talked to
companies and they're like oh we throw
all that data away and you're like
that's gonna be the foundation that
you're gonna build your models and make
things successful from but you've got to
understand what is that differentiation
what is the thing that you've got that's
unique about your business that you can
build a great date asset on and then
build models on top of that so before
you even start thinking about AI you
should probably think about saving your
data just making sure that and saving
collecting and really looking for places
where you have data where you can tell
this was a good outcome or this is a bad
outcome right if you take insurance this
person default on a loan this person
didn't default on a loan so I can I use
that to predict forecasting financials I
knew why I predicted very accurately
based on this information I predicted
poorly here the more you have those
those are the labels that's the stuff
that's gonna feed into your model and
it's really gonna you know be the way
that your AI algorithm is gonna learn
and so if you have that then you've got
the foundation to do something
interesting
awesome so you're using the term a lot
model yeah and for those that are maybe
don't know what a model is how would you
describe what is a model yeah
a model is it's really just a system of
predicting what's gonna happen based on
some inputs and so I mean you can think
of a really simple model you can think
of Scott today Scott Guthrie was talking
about I want to predict the price of a
car and so a model could be as simple as
you know I take the year that the car
was and I take the condition of the car
and I multiply it by three and that's
the price of the car that would be a
particularly bad model an AI model is
now going to take those same inputs and
come up with a price based on you know
how a I sort of learned and so there are
a lot of different ways you can
represent models and think about them
but at base that's what a model is it's
something that predicts something
awesome so we want all of your questions
so make sure you get them in and I want
to ask them for those that maybe don't
have a lot of data and they want to do
AI how can Microsoft help so there are a
lot of ways that companies can get
started there are a lot of use case that
depends on what people are trying to do
if you look at their speech you know if
I want to add speech recognition to any
application that I've got how could I do
it well I could go and collect a whole
bunch of speech people talking and
transcribe that and then build a model
that predicts that or I could use a card
in my service which is gonna do it way
better than what they're already doing
so we have a wide suite of cognitive
services that'll just really help
accelerate people you don't need
anything to go and use a cognitive
service and you can do speech you can do
vision you can do language you can do
search all of these you know right off
the bat you can go and get started with
them yeah and it's really easy I have it
here on my screen you go to a sure calm
front slash cognitive I think it'll go
right to it and like an easy one to look
at is his vision basically I'm clicking
it right here and if you go to for
example seen an activity recognition and
images you basically just upload your
picture yeah
it's really simple if you have you know
you want to be able to identify the
objects in a particular scene just
upload it and it'll sort of show you the
different things on it then you can go
further with that the custom vision
service and you can say everyone's
favorite example if you watch the TV
show Silicon Valley not yet but I will
hot dog or no hot dog hot dog no hot dog
this is a classic app
really funny part of the the movie or
the TV show you can build that in about
I built it in two hours but that's
because I'm not a great programmer
anymore I usually happened I got old
yeah I stopped programming as the main
you know two hours though to build a hot
dog non Hunter and it was really very
good I did you use cognitive services
what I did is I use the custom vision
model okay and so I went to Bing and I
searched for pictures of hot dogs and I
found about 20 of them and I put them in
there and I four pictures of things that
weren't hot dogs nice and there's your
classifier and it really was very
straightforward to go and build awesome
so here's some questions coming in does
Microsoft AI support self training
classifiers so I think we do with Auto
machine learning so automatic machine
learning will do that automatic machine
learning is yeah so I guess it depends a
little bit what they mean by self
training classifier automatic machine
learning is gonna do a lot of that what
automatic machine learning does is you
basically would specify here's the data
set that I have and I don't know do I
need a support vector machine do I need
a neural network to a needle gistic
regression I'm not an AI expert please
just figure out the right model for me
and so automatic machine learning is
gonna do that for you and so that's
available today you can get that as part
of Azure machine learning in the SDK
it's one line of code and it'll go and
build you a model just based off a data
set I have the line of code actually
right I'm scrolling it here it is it's
it's literally oh no that's the
deployment sorry that's this here it is
it's the auto machine learning yeah it's
actually two lines but because one you
define the problem and to run it it's
actually one line right actually really
nice it's really straightforward really
simple to use and we're finding a ton of
customers who are using this and it
really broadens the scope they're really
two ways I see people using it one is
you know if you're a data scientist
there's a lot of tedium that you go
through in trying let's try the support
vector machine let's try a learning rate
of 0.1 and trying to change all these
parameters now you can just sort of say
just give me a model that's pretty good
you know an automatic machine learning
will just go and do that the other class
of users are people who don't even know
what they would need to do and they can
you know if I'm a developer but I don't
know how to do machine learning I can
use automatic machine learning and get a
model just from two lines of code so
let's see if I understand so basically
you have a bunch
yeah III obviously usually I think of
Excel because it's the canonical I say
Excel and everyone's like oh I just
pictured a row like a bunch of square of
data and you say here are the columns I
want to use to learn and then here's the
column I want to learn you feed it in
and then it does it and it's funny you
say excel because in power bi in and we
announce this as in preview that it'll
be integrated as a wizard where you can
walk through the experience doing
exactly that and so create a model just
from saying this is the column I want to
predict and here's the rest of the data
that I've got and that's pretty amazing
I mean if you look at the code right
here hopefully you can go to the screen
you can see that there is this data
script that's basically says get data
and in there you define and you can see
my get data script right over let me go
here real quick get data script right
here it's basically saying here's the X
and here's the Y you want to learn you
give it that and then it says I'm gonna
run a bunch of model that's right it
goes through it tries all the different
models it's really great it's a it's a
little meta it is a machine learn model
that predicts which machine learned
model is gonna work best on this set of
data and the more you use it the more
you use it on your sets of data it
actually learns right from the history
of how it's gone and predicted and it
gets better because it has a great
answer of like well how well did it
predict against the test set and so the
more you use automatic machine learning
the better it's gonna work for your data
the better is gonna work for you which
is really pretty neat and the cool thing
about this and this and this is the meta
bit like it's using a recommendation
algorithm so basically like your
shopping cart when you go shopping
online and it recommends other products
we have that AI when you run a model and
it says oh it did okay it starts to
recommend others and it runs them it's
pretty cool it's exactly it's the same
idea so the exact same implementation
was the same ideas that yeah really cool
really simple to use and I think
honestly going forward I think more and
more stuff is gonna start fitting into
that automatic machine learning paradigm
I think you're gonna start seeing image
classifiers work that way you know I all
the types of things that you're doing
today more and more of it's gonna fit
into automatic machine learning and
that's that's really our goal is how do
we simplify this stuff because there's
so many people now who the demand to
have a machine learn model the number of
people who wanted the demand freya is
really high but there aren't enough
people who can go and develop it and so
how do we make it simple so that any
developer can go and build and have an
AI model you have developers today if
you think about I use the analogy of a
hash table developers use hash tables
without even thinking about right they
probably learned about it in college and
they studied what's a good hash function
and things like that
no one's ever actually implemented that
they just use a map and they just call
it right how do we get that you know
machine learning from the days where it
is today we kind of need to be an expert
in linear algebra and calculus and you
know back propagation to know this is a
space here's my data push a button and
go do it it's coming and we're gonna get
there but you know what it's still okay
to learn linear algebra or calculus
because it is dear to my heart because
I'm a nerd I'm not wearing my glasses
but if I was you would see love
calculator oh and and this is what
you're seeing a lot of people doing
everyone who's a developer out there
today is learning more and more about
how to be a data scientist and it much
like the hash table understanding the
fundamentals is really going to be
important to doing it effectively
awesome so it looks like Tony from
Brazil is watching we want to say hello
to you my friend I have an idea in mind
to build a face recognition for my
business customer comes profile loads
for receptionist can azure help me with
this that's a great question so we have
the Congress service the face
recognition API and so you can
absolutely go and do that and have it
recognize your customers and and suggest
a profile of it I think it's you know
it's really great idea right a customer
walks in and you say oh they typically
order you know this particular type of
cup of coffee or something
you can start getting it ready as soon
as they walk in and so for your regulars
what a great experience right I'm coming
back to that restaurant every time
because they're gonna be ready that much
faster they see me coming and that's
amazing like just with computer vision
it will tell you the box around the face
right and then you can use in China
together with with custom vision with
faces of your customers and so you get
the face box you take the box out and
you give it to custom vision and now
it'll tell you that's right you can
build up the profile in the history over
time and so I think it's a really
interesting use for how face recognition
they're actually already are
coffee shops and China that do this
really so absolutely you you walk in and
they they recognize you and they get
your drink already so I think this is
gonna be coming more and more awesome so
follow-on question but do you have an
auto classifier where the data does not
have predefined data so the auto
classifier would group similar things I
mean that's a really good question
I'd like look I'm an engineer and most
people don't know this but I'm like an
AI person yes so like right away when
you say group things I'm thinking like
k-means or hierarchical clustering or
Gaussian mixture models so there's
already ways to do that yeah but we have
the compute to do any type of machine
learning I'll tell us a little bit about
Auto a machine Azure machine learning
service and what that is sure so you
know you talk about you need access to
the compute to go and train your
different models that's one of the you
know why is AI really taken off it's
been three factors first is the amount
of data that's available the advent of
big data and product you know products
like spark and an azure data bricks and
now you can use those to really manage
your large data sets
the second you alluded to is compute and
it comes in in two different ways one is
it comes through GPUs which have really
accelerated the amount of parallel
computation you can do and things
particularly matrix multiplication as
well as the cloud where these GPUs are
really expensive and if I need twenty or
a hundred of them I don't wanna have to
go buy them because I probably only need
them for a few hours and so the cloud
ability to go and use all that compute
you know for the time that I need and
only pay for what I use has really
transformed it and then the third thing
is the new algorithms coming up with you
know deep learning and convolutional
nets and things like that has opened up
a whole host of applications and so with
Azure machine learning what we're trying
to do is bring that together and make it
really easy for you to consume and so
you know we do it through a Python SDK
so you can be in an azure notebook or a
jupiter notebook or in vs code or in
pycharm or whatever you like to use
you're right there in your notebook and
you can get access to start training
locally change one line of code you know
now i'm accessing a whole host of
resources on the cloud and you know
managing the data that's stored in
anyway you can store it on Azure data at
everything from Azure data Lake to you
know
cloud DB everything is all out there
cosmos DB awesome so yeah it's all
really simple and integrated so we
started with if you want to just get
started quickly you should use cognitive
services yeah if you want to customize a
little bit we have some custom versions
of cognitive services we mentioned
custom vision there's also others you
can I think you can upload your own
acoustic and language models for speeds
that's right you can use Lewis to start
to tag your own data and get so there's
ways easy ways to enter but let's talk
now to those that maybe are more
advanced that are starting to use like
scikit-learn or pi torch or tensorflow
can you tell us what the current
development process is like and how
Azure machine learning trimmers can help
sure you it's interesting the
progression you walked with we think
about it as cognitive services are you
know Microsoft's model Microsoft's data
the custom services are Microsoft's
model with the customers data and then
when I want to get to a custom model
well then it's the customers model and
the customers data and so you know how
do you do that if I'm building a model
you know frequently what I'll do is I
will come up with the set of data that I
have that I think has the best features
in it and I'll come up with the
algorithm that I think I'm going to use
and I'm gonna Rigaud and train it and
then we call that an experiment and I go
and run and I compare that experiment
against the the history that I've got
the test data that I've got and I see
how well I performed and what you find
people doing is this iterative loop over
and over where they keep changing maybe
I need some more features or made this
feature is gonna make it predict you
know in my car example maybe the year is
not very interesting but the location
the zip code is or something like that
what features can I add in and so as
your machine learning will keep track of
all the experiments that you've run so
that you can see which one actually
perform the best without and you know
basically keeps the history of what did
you do different each time that you had
it and then when I have a model and I'm
ready to sort of deploy it then the you
know Azure machine learning will put it
in the model registry and so now I can
keep track of all the models that I've
got and as I deploy them I can
understand where each model is and its
life cycle is it deployed in which
different systems and so it can manage
that deployment and management of them
much
much simpler there a couple of other
capabilities that I think are pretty
interesting I talked about sort of the
the the lifecycle of I'm going through
all these different experiments a lot of
times what I want to do is what's called
hyper parameter tuning right each of
these models there are probably a dozen
different parameters the learning rate
the number of nodes in each level all
sorts of different things and so hyper
parameter tuning is a way of helping you
select the best ones without having to
sort of painstakingly iterate through
them all yourself and so you put all
that together and it dramatically
simplifies the machine learning
developer the data scientists in getting
their models develop they're become much
more productive we talked to people who
you know have spent weeks training a
model and rather like we can get this
done in a day I can do this much much
faster and the important thing to note
is that like look generally when I'm
running these things I usually run it on
my machine and then my machine is tied
up and then I try to get someone else
and I'm using PI torch 0.4 0.1 9 7 & 8
you know and Sally's using PI torch 1
preview because she's all way more
advanced than I am and it's hard to get
all these things to match up how does a
skirmish e-learning help people that
work in teams and data science teams
what is it about Azure machine learning
that will help people work together yeah
I mean there are a couple things you can
look at you know one is you mentioned
like my machines all tied up that's the
beauty of the cloud right is I can now
use extra computation on the cloud I can
put it in a data science VM I can put it
on the training modules a whole host of
GPUs and have sort of complete access to
my machine the other is really the
reproducibility I can take sort of each
model and I can sort of run it the exact
same way that you ran it and so yeah you
mentioned the different versions and all
the different things that I'd need to do
you know makes it much easier to sort of
say hey we're all sort of working on the
same thing and share the code and and
really stay aligned with it and that's
something that we've learned internally
you know we have on our internal
services thousands of developers working
on the same model and Bing and how do
you do that effectively how do you have
a thousand people try and make
improvements to the single model you
have to have all this infrastructure and
so as we've learned from Bing all that
infrastructure that we built is
through our machine learning and that's
what we're deploying in as machine
learning all the things we've learned in
making that product much better awesome
well keep your questions coming
obviously any AI questions that you
might have we want to get those in so
there was announcements regarding AI
today can you tell us about those sure
it's a couple announcements that we made
first and foremost our machine learning
is generally available I'm really
excited about this we've had a whole
bunch of customers try it and preview
and their feedback has been really
really great they think the direction
that we're going with it has been
fantastic we feel like the quality of
the service the quality of our
documentation understanding is all great
and so we're happy to announce that it's
generally available product and you know
with that all the things that come with
that automated automatic machine
learning which we've talked about is
generally available the hyper parameter
tuning the experimentation capabilities
the model management the ability to
deploy all of that service generally
available and something that people can
go and take and use which is really
exciting another thing that we announced
today is the onyx runtime so I talked a
little bit about onyx at the start onyx
is this file format for exchanging
models and you know for really making it
simpler for hardware manufacturers to to
optimize them one of the challenges that
hardware manufacturers talk us or talk
to us about is they say look I've got
tensorflow I've got PI torch I've got
chain ER I've got paddle paddle I've got
cafe I've got all these different
frameworks and people expect me to
optimize each and every one of them how
do I do that simply and onyx says hey
you can just sort of make this in onyx
model they can all convert into onyx and
now you can optimize one of them what
the onyx runtime is is this is the same
runtime we've been using in Windows and
Windows machine learning it's now
available open source it runs on Linux
it will run on Windows and it runs
dramatically faster than sort of the
native implementations and so we've seen
internally you know virtually every
model has run faster some have the
average is probably around 2% two times
faster but some have been as many as
like seven or eight times faster and so
this is available it's open sourced and
people can go and get it I'm really
excited about that as well another thing
that we announce that there's sort of
major areas around cognitive services
we are the only company that does
containerize Congress surprises people
want to be able to run AI models and
they don't want to just consume it in
the cloud sometimes they have latency
requirements or they have intermittent
connectivity for some machine that
they're trying to run it in and so they
want to be able to take the model and
run it on Prem or on the edge right and
so we announced containerized models and
today we announced that the language
understanding model is also available in
a container amazing Lewis Lewis Lewis is
now available in containers so that's
amazing I was recently like I was
recently in in New Zealand and one of
the hospitals there they wanted to use
cognitive services to do OCR yeah but
they couldn't do it because they could
not but the records could not be upload
to the cloud this really enables them to
start to do that work that's exactly one
of the use cases we see is you know
regulations prevent them from moving the
data and so being able to bring me the
cognitive service directly to where they
actually have the data opens up all
kinds of doors that previously they
couldn't do before and so we have had a
ton of positive feedback from customers
on it people are really excited about
this so I'm excited to see that going
out it's basically the first ever lift
and shift down that I've ever seen yeah
it's interesting all the you know
everyone is trying to lift and shift up
to the cloud and and look that's an
important trend because the cloud offers
a lot of advantages but as a company
we've been very committed to the hybrid
and making sure we work with people
where they need to be and often that
means hey some of the things we've done
in the cloud need to happen on the edge
there are real legitimate requirements a
little why that needs to be done and so
we want to make sure that that's support
like just basically and here's a really
silly use case that I thought of if you
run a parking lot and you want to have
an unattended parking lot and still
charged people you can have a local
model taking picture as cars drive in
with OCR getting license plates that's
right all sorts of examples like that
where you know we hear of manufacture of
companies that have manufacturing plants
that you know their connectivity comes
and goes right they have vehicles that
they want to drive out into the field
that they might not have any
connectivity at all and so to be able to
still run models locally
these did a lot of great examples with
drones they want to fly drones along
power lines and sort of see hey are
there defects and the power lines and
things like that things they need to go
repair you could have someone drive for
thousands of miles you could fly a drone
and have it take pictures say this is
where you need to go to that's awesome
and so yeah it works great so here's a
couple questions well ml dotnet expand
to training framework so I don't have to
learn Python numpy tensorflow PI torch
and I can rather stay in c-sharp or I
feel at home so I'm all that nut has a
whole host of algorithms where you can
it you can train models directly in
c-sharp in ml dotnet and well that net
again grew out of internal technology
that we had were a bunch of internal
developers use C sharp and wanted to
have a good framework for developing
their models in c-sharp and so we've
wrapped it up and made it ml dot and
that is something that now you can go in
and train models in c-sharp you know we
have a ton of developers in c-sharp that
are really not well served by the ml
community because the ml community says
everything has to be in Python and so
being able to have ml net as a way that
you can now stay in c-sharp is really
pretty interesting for people and you
know there's still a ton of activity
happening on Python so I wouldn't
necessarily discourage you from learning
Python because that's where there's a
lot of value being created but
absolutely I'm Ella and that's gonna let
you stay in c-sharp awesome next
question ai is more than just image
recognition what about searching for
text and dynamic images kernels your
engine is not accurate and cost per
transaction forces us to use on-premise
solution interesting so I'm not really
sure what they mean about not dangerous
or dynamic images yeah I mean maybe in
videos or something
I mean so the the OCR solution that we
have I get benchmarks on all of our
under services on a weekly basis we're
beating everybody else with OCR so I
believe we have the best
OCR solution that's out there it really
performs quite well and you know we have
I talked to our researchers they are
very proud of the techniques that
they've used some of those some of the
tricks that they've done in their models
to make it really perform so well you
know additionally with images you need
to sort of talk about finding different
things within the image I mean I love
the example today that you had
the NBA example showing really the face
detection working on all sorts of small
areas there's also logo detection right
and being able to find the logos and all
sorts of different places in it and one
of the places where we really pull all
this together is a knowledge mining
right so you take exactly what you were
doing and now you've got your extracting
all this information from across an
image and some of it is OCR some of it
is looking for text in an image some of
it is face recognition on the image some
of it is sentiment analysis on the image
or on the text or whatever it is I'm
building an index that's now searchable
and brings all the you know the named
entities you can sort of think of
whether they're people or places and
what's the relationships between them
you can bring all that together and so
knowledge mining makes that really
powerful now and I will say for for you
that that submitted this question like
if it's not working for you can you
email me and I'll look at it because
I've seen our OCR engine get like words
behind chain-link fences that say stop
that are crooked and give you the right
bounding box it's ridiculous I've even
seen it there's you love the blacked-out
text where they used a magic marker and
you can still kind of see the text
interact of it and our OCR is telling
you what the text is underneath of it
which is really very cool it's amazing
okay so tell us a little bit about some
of the exciting things that you see some
of the customers doing because one of
the problems with this technology is
people have a hard time like saying they
once they get it they're like oh okay I
can see how this works yeah but they
have a hard time seeing where it might
fit in there in their business what are
some exciting things you're seeing
customers you know there's been a lot of
interesting examples you know one of the
things I may be more fun ones is you
know we've talked to shell and so shell
has gas stations of course all around
the world and so they put cameras in
there gas stations and what they really
want to detect is fire which is a big
problem at a gas station but what they
also are detecting are is the person
who's filling up with gas is he's
smoking and if they are they want to
alert the attendant say hey go yell at
that person it's really dangerous to
smoke at a gas station and so lots of
applications like that we see a ton of
image classification applications
companies you know Jabil is looking they
manufacture chip boards and so
the last step they wanted to sort of
take an image of it and see did we miss
any of the solder is in it is there
anything any defects we can see with
this and so just improving the quality
that they have there we see a ton of
Bott solutions people are looking for
BOTS you know often in customer support
can I deflect you know twenty percent of
my customer support costs and save
myself twenty million dollars while
giving my customers a better experience
we see virtual assistants where people
want you know their branded experience
their voice you know sort of interacting
with a customer in a virtual assistant
way so we see a lot of solutions there
so yeah just a ton of applications
across the board awesome so we have a
question coming in how could I use AI to
help with accounting such as invoice
coding so I'm not an accountant and I'm
not entirely sure what invoice coding is
but I'll guess um you know presumably it
sounds like a classification problem
right I have an invoice come in and I
need to decide which budget do I charge
it to or which type of invoice it should
be or anything like that there are a
number of different ways you can do it
depending on sort of higher invoice
comes and one is you can do image
classification if you have an invoice
that sort of looks like image one or an
image and something else that looks
different you can do it that way the
other is to build sort of text
classification and sort of understand
what type of system this is but that's
the standard classification problem and
that's the exact example of what I'm
talking about of each business and each
industry needs to find the ways that
things are changing for them and how
they can really use it to make their
business better where you know if you
can speed up your your classification on
your accounting invoices and have better
accuracy with that you just get so much
acceleration from that as a business and
so really finding those ways that
haven't really getting the industry to
have the creativity to understand one of
the places they should be using this
technology that's gonna be one of the
most exciting things over the next few
years I found earlier Mike early in my
career as a programmer anytime someone
wanted me to optimize something I would
look for tasks that someone repeated
exactly the same way off that's right
now I feel like when I'm doing AI my
particular smell is if someone is like
altering code like point seven to 0.5 or
adding extra if statements and then
deploying yeah like for me when you're
doing those kinds of tweaks where you
feel like you need to take a shower
afterwards as a coder that's a good
place to start thinking about using a on
they're using rules to make a prediction
that's what you're sort of describing
should it be 0.5 is the threshold should
it be point 3 isn't threshold and you
know this is where I say you saw this in
fraud a lot and I get a thousand
requests from the same IP is probably
fraudulent and you know I remember the
early days when I was working on fraud
you know AOL dial-up modems were a huge
problem that tells me how old long I've
been working on fraud because they all
came from the same ip address and so you
shut down all of AOL from their one IP
address and they and I are models gonna
be much better to learn that hey they're
different patterns that I should be
looking for and so instead of having
these broad course rules I'll have these
you know I can really pull in a thousand
different features in and build a model
around that let's talk a little bit
about sort of the elephant in the room
and this is important because people are
looking at this and they're like hey how
much is this gonna cost if I want to use
if I want to build my own machine
learning model and Azure machine
learning service is this gonna cost me a
lot so the beauty of using the cloud is
that you use only what you consume right
and so the cost for GPUs if you were to
go out and buy a whole host of them
they're tremendously expensive and so
the rates that you can use when you're
using the training service you know is
measured in you know the tens of cents
per hour and things like that so
dramatically cheaper you know building
models yeah there's cost associated with
it but it's it's not exorbitant this is
something and the benefits that you get
from it on the other side I don't think
I've seen anyone come back and say hey
we're not gonna build this model because
the the training costs are too high and
here's the thing like I I've laid down
an azure machine learning service
workspace and we basically lay down for
things we lay down a pin sites which is
nothing yeah we lay down storage which
is empty yeah right we lay down a CR
which there's a free version yeah right
and then we lay down so app insides
Azure storage ACR and there's there's
one more thing that I'm forgetting
happens science as your storage ACR and
there's one more that'll come to me and
compute back
oh yeah the computer yeah the compute
stuff and like you and even the compute
isn't laid
until you specifically specifically
asked for it and so you can also create
a compute environment that has zero to n
nodes yeah and it won't even run yeah I
mean that's you know I honestly I don't
know how everyone doesn't develop on the
cloud these days the the economies of
scale that you get from being in a cloud
are just they just give you such a
better efficiency from that it's pretty
amazing okay so we've got about three or
four minutes left where can people go to
find out a little bit more about this AI
stuff and how can they like get start
like if you're a programmer and and
because you already know all about all
this AI stuff what would you suggest
someone go do right now I mean the
things that the easiest way to really
get started is to go and look at the
azure notebooks and start with they're
the azure notebooks will walk you
through how to use Azure machine
learning service notebooks are such a
great environment for learning in
because there's a description of what
you're trying to do right in line with
the cell that executes the code you can
change the code and continue to execute
it and make it just go right there in
line that's the thing that I would
recommend everyone go and do it'll both
you know depending on sort of what you
need to learn if you need to learn how
the services work they're great document
they're great notebooks sort of walking
you through how to use the service if
you need to learn how to build AI models
there are notebooks that'll show you hey
here's some of the simple iya models do
I want to do like you know the classic
amnesty I can type draw number and sort
of have it recognize you can those are
really straightforward ways to go and do
that
I just remembered it's key vault is the
last one so there's four things we lay
down storage app insights key bald and
Azure as er a CR right which is as a
container registry okay so I figured I'd
show just a little bit of its what this
looks like because a lot of you are
probably wondering what this looks like
and like it's really simple and the cool
thing is that the part that maybe we
haven't seen in Francesca's showed that
a little bit during Scott's demo is we
actually have these amazing integrations
individuals to your code where I can go
in and submit experiments by
right-clicking right or viewer
experiments or attaching right and and
that's that the coolest part right and
the other thing that I really liked
about this that I've used so far
there's a team of like four or five of
us that work on these models and all of
us can see what all of us are doing yeah
like here's an example that you talked
about hyper parameter tuning yeah it ran
20 experiments and notice that here
there's like this green line it actually
stopped running it because it's like
yeah this one didn't work what a type of
rider is not working and that's cool
because initially like usually I'm
running a for loop and spanning over
hyper parameters like the learning rate
or momentum or whatever here it's a
smarter for loop because if it's within
and I use the bandit method if it's got
20 percent it's gonna kill it now and
that's a great example of you know
usually you'd have to sort of be sitting
there and watching and tracking having
it basically printf hey this is what's
the learning rate how it's converging
you know high parameter tuning is just
gonna do that for you and so it's it's
really saves a ton of time for you and
the other thing is and this is the part
that's really cool here's all the
computer environment you see on my
computer we have like some batch AI we
have some kubernetes services in our
compute and it's basically we just
submit and forget and then we can see
all the output it shows us all the
output in notebooks it's amazing now
here's the the part that we were talking
about models to me are like the
executable part of a on yeah that's
right it's like it's like when you
compile your code to get this assembly I
feel like that's what a model is - it
was a great analogy you put something in
and something comes out and as a
programmer it's something that we want a
version yeah and in here you can see we
are versioning all of the models that's
right and then we can marry models with
scoring files to create images and then
we can do deployments and so for example
you can see the simple m nest service
right here I wrote it like a cheesy
little app here where I submit like I
can draw a number this is the cheesiest
version the cheesiest thing but you can
see it returns things from me directly
from the service and I'm gonna make like
weird numbers and you can see that oh it
really thinks it's a 4 but if I start to
do crazy things like this you can see
that it's gonna start to be sure about
other things right and it's it's pretty
cool that you're able to go from idea to
submit a job to save a model to create
an image deployment all within the same
environment yeah I think it's really
important that the software development
lifecycle for models is different than
for software so it is and so
understanding what are the tools that I
need and how do I really use that more
effectively those are the things that
are gonna make you productive and
successful in building your models and
deploying them if you if you try and do
it you know sort of the standard
software way you're gonna have a hard
time figuring out how it all fits
together
awesome well anything else to finish up
with my friend I'm really excited that
Azure machine learning is GA I think
there's gonna be a ton of amazing uses
for it and I'm excited to see what
people will do with it
well thank you so much for being with us
Eric all right well the show is not over
we have my amazing colleague Brian Benz
just over there with Beth to talk all
things java let's go to that

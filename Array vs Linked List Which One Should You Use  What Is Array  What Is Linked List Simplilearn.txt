now without any further delay let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
we will start this discussion with a
brief understanding of array in data
structure
following which we will deal with linked
list and data structure
and finally we will cover the comparison
between array and linked list based on
different parameters
i hope the agenda is clear for today's
session now let's get started with our
first topic which is array in data
structure
basically an array is a data structure
that contains homogeneous elements what
i mean by that is an array will only
store the elements having the same data
type
additionally the memory location in the
case of arrays is static and contiguous
that means a declaration of an array
must be made at compile time the command
that we use to declare an array in data
structure consists of three fields
the first one is data type
the second one is name of an array and
the third one is its size
for example int array 5
further if you want to pass some values
into an array you can pass the list of
elements as shown
once we do that an array structure gets
created with the data elements at
contiguous memory locations
the next important property of an array
conveys that the elements of a created
array can be accessed using the indexes
of data elements
for example consider this array it
consists of five data elements
and if we want to return the element at
index 0 to the console then we can use
the command printf percentage of d array
0
which will return the element at index 0
that is 4.
on that note let's discuss a few
essential properties of linked list as
well
the linked list is a collection of data
elements that we call nodes these nodes
are stored at non-contagious locations
in memory
additionally each node contains two
fields one to store data and another to
store the address to the next node or
the reference node to the next node
let's assume that nodes in this figure
are at addresses 200 400 500
respectively
i have filled these addresses in address
fields as well
the identity of the linked list that we
always keep with us is the address of
the head node
we often name a pointer or reference
variable at which we store this address
as head
and as the definition of a linked list
says the linked list is a dynamic data
structure whose size can be changed at
runtime
that means we can either decrease or
increase the size of the linked list at
any instance in our program
for increasing the size of linked list
we use the malloc function in c
programming language
malloc is a library function that
allocates a block of memory on the heap
the program accesses this block of
memory via a pointer that malloc returns
further when the memory is no longer
needed the pointer gets passed to the
free function in c in order to
deallocate the memory provided by the
maillock function
the function free must be called
explicitly in order to do that
if you want to understand the
implementation of a linked list or any
of its functionalities we suggest you go
through our video on the linked list in
data structure it might help you grab a
better understanding of linked list
in this video we are going to stick to
the comparison between these two data
structures and analyze which one is most
favorable in different conditions
having said that let's get started with
the comparison between array and linked
list
the first parameter that we want to talk
about is the cost of accessing an
element
irrespective of the size of an array it
takes constant time to access an element
in the array and this is because an
array is stored as one contiguous block
of memory
so if we know the starting address or
the base address of this block of memory
we can traverse the whole array to
access the element that we want
so let us say what we have here is an
integer array and the base addresses for
this is 200
that means the first byte in this block
is at address 200.
further if we want to calculate the
address of an element at index i then it
will be equal to 200 plus i into the
size of an integer in
bytes and as we know the size of an
integer is typically 4 bytes
hence it will be 200 plus 4 into i
which means knowing the addresses of an
element in an array is the only
calculation part our compiler will need
to perform
that is why accessing elements in an
array cost is constant time this
constant time is also represented as big
o of 1 in terms of average case
complexity notation
and in the case of linked list we have
multiple blocks of memory at different
addresses
out of which our compiler just remembers
the head node using the pointer variable
so in order to read any element out of
this linked list we will have to
traverse all the elements until the
element that we are looking for gets
found
due to this the average case complexity
for accessing an element in a linked
list is big o of n
now the second parameter that we want to
talk about is memory usage
in the case of an array we need to
declare its size at the compile time
which means we will have to know the
size of an array before even creating it
hence to avoid an overflow error what we
typically do is we create a large enough
array to store all the elements
for example in this particular case we
have only three elements to store but we
create an array with size phi to remove
overflow error
while we achieve to do that we waste
eight bytes of memory as we have two
empty fields in our array
meanwhile in the case of a linked list
we do not lose any memory due to its
dynamic nature
even if we use extra memory space we can
empty it at any time using the free
function in the c programming language
the only factor that utilizes extra
memory in case of a linked list is
pointers
however it remains the best solution
when it comes to memory management
another point with memory allocation
that i want to discuss with you guys is
that sometimes when we create an
exceptionally large array maybe memory
may not be available as one large block
this problem that we have with arrays is
also called as memory fragmentation
problem
but if we use a linked list the memory
will be available as multiple small
blocks so for memory management linked
list is far better than array
now the third parameter that we will
talk about is the cost of inserting an
element at the beginning remember when
we talk about arrays here we are also
talking about the possible use of an
array as a dynamic list
well for insertion at the beginning of a
dynamic list we will have to swap the
locations of the element at current
positions
the complexity for this swapping
operation will be big o of n itself
meanwhile the complexity to insert an
element at the zeroth index will be big
o of 1.
hence the overall complexity for this
insertion will become big o of 1 into n
which is big o of n
for the insertion at the beginning of a
linked list we need a constant time
because a compiler just remembers the
address of the head node and inserting a
new node does not require any extensive
computation
thus the complexity of insertion at the
beginning of a linked list is big o of
1.
next up is the cost of inserting an
element at the end
for this insertion to happen in the
array we will face big o of 1 time
complexity as arrays need constant time
to access any of their indexes
for example in this representation of an
array inserting an element at index 4
will just cost us big o of 1.
meanwhile in the case of a linked list
this operation is comparatively costlier
than arrays
for instance consider this structure as
a linked list and we want to insert an
element at the end of this linked list
so to do that we will need to traverse
the whole linked list until we reach the
tail node once we get there the
reference part of the previous tail node
gets linked to the new node and the
element gets inserted
but the traversal for this operation
cost us big o of small n itself
also the insertion for a given ith index
cost us big o of big n in the case of
both data structures
the next parameter that we will talk
about is a deletion in the case of
dynamic array and linked list
the complexity for deletion at front and
the ith index cost as big o of small n
whereas the complexity for deletion at
the end of the dynamic array remains
mysterious
by that what i mean is the complexity
for insertion in a dynamic list is
dependent on the programming paradigm
for example it is big o of one for java
and big o of n for c and c plus plus
whereas there is no such confusion for
linked lists even though it is also a
dynamic data structure
the time complexity of deletion at the
start of a linked list is big o of one
whereas it is big o of small n in the
other two instances
now let's also discuss deletion in a
static array
for static arrays the deletion at the
end cost us big o of one and in contrast
to that
the other two scenarios cost us big o of
n due to the swapping activity that we
have discussed earlier
the last parameter that we are going to
talk about is the ease of implementation
an array is comparatively easier to
implement than the linked list as it
only requires a few lines of code
but arrays take more time to execute
operations such as insertion and
deletion whereas link lists are quicker
to perform these operations like
insertion and deletion
the only difficulty we have in the case
of linked list is that its execution is
dependent on the programming environment
in the case of c and c plus plus linked
lists are more prone to errors like
segmentation fault and memory leaks
that is why working with linked lists
necessitates caution
whereas aries are more user-friendly and
error-less for their coding
implementations
having said that let's have a look at
which data structure to use in different
conditions
as we have seen earlier insertion and
deletion and linked list can be achieved
in constant time thus when you require
your application to handle data
insertion and removal at a rapid speed a
linked list is the way to go
whereas if you want to traverse your
list faster arrays are preferred over
linked lists
next up is size declaration when you are
clear about the number of items in your
list an array is the suitable data
structure for you
otherwise if you aren't familiar with
the number of items in your list link
list will be the better option for you
as with arrays you may need to
re-declare and copy memory if the array
grows too big
next is accessing an element if you want
to access any element by its index in
your program then array will be the
ideal option for you
because in the case of a linked list you
will need to traverse the whole list
from its head node for each insertion
which is not a good practice due to
higher complexity
insertion is the last scenario on our
list
if you want to insert elements at the
end of a list an array is the ideal
option because it takes constant time
and if you wish to insert elements in
the middle of the list linked list will
be the best alternative
so this is all about array versus linked
list i hope this video was informative

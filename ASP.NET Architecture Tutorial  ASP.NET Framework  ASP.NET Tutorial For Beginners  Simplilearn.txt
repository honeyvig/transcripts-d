hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will learn
everything we need to know about the
asp.net architecture
first let's have a look at the agenda
for this session
we shall begin with learning the basics
of asp.net
then we shall go on to learn the asp.net
architecture
after the architecture we shall focus on
the components and the characteristics
of asp.net
but before we begin make sure you're
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click on the bell icon so you never miss
an update from simply learn
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is asp.net
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing dynamic web applications
it is the latest version of the active
server pages
active server pages is a server-side
scripting language and engine used for
developing web applications
it is essentially a web-based platform
that helps to create dynamic web pages
for programmers
asp.net produces interactive data-driven
web applications on the internet
it works on http protocols and uses http
commands to set communication between
the server and the browser
the codes can be written in many
different languages like c-sharp visual
studio and javascript
the latest version of asp.net is the
active server pages which microsoft
developed to build websites it was
released in 2002 and had an extension of
dot aspx
asp.net consists of a large number of
controls such as text boxes buttons and
labels for assembling
it produces interactive data-driven web
applications on the internet which helps
to build websites and web applications
in a better and colorful way
now when we know what is asp.net let's
have a look at the architecture of
asp.net
asp.net architecture
consists of three different components
the first component is language
then comes library and finally comes the
common language runtime
moving forward we shall learn about
these three components one after the
another the first component we have
is language
whenever we build an application the
first task is to communicate with the
application which is made possible by
different programming languages
the three major languages that asp.net
uses to communicate with a computer
are c sharp vb.net and f-sharp
the second component is the library
library is a pre-written class or a
coded template that a developer can use
while developing an application
the most common library used for asp.net
web applications is the web library
web library is a part of a website that
offers a collection of websites when
users browse
it possesses all the properties that
help in building a web application
the third and last integral component is
the common language runtime
common language runtime is a platform
used to execute the programs
common language runtime mainly helps to
execute dot net programs and it is also
used for performing key activities like
garbage collection and exception
handling
the code that the common language
runtime directly manages is called the
managed code
now when we know about the architecture
and its components let's have a look at
some of the characteristics of asp.net
here we shall see five characteristics
of asp.net
beginning with code behind model
then we have directives followed by
caching and after caching we have user
controls and state management
let's have a look at all these
characteristics one by one
beginning with the code behind model
characteristic
code behind model helps in dealing with
dynamic programming code
it also helps to place code in a
separate designated script or a specific
file named as mypage.aspx.cs
while the main page file is mypage.aspx
code behind model also helps to create
applications with different content the
second characteristic is directives
directives act like a support to the
pages it gives support by providing
special instructions to the developer on
how a page should be processed
directives also specify and enable the
attribute to show how an application
should be used
then comes the third characteristic and
that is caching
caching helps in improving the
performance of an application which
helps a user to use an application more
efficiently
it also helps to store page requests of
the user in a temporary location
the fourth characteristic is user
controls
the sections of pages that are
registered and used as controls are
called as the user controls
user controls also create markup files
that contain static html markup and
server side web controls
the fifth and final characteristic is
the state management characteristic
asp.net provides state management which
helps to store the state of every user
by providing the state of every user
it becomes easy to use asp.net
applications

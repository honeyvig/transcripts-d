hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about the top arduino
projects for 2022 but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies so if
you're a tech geek in a continuous hunt
for latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session so we will get started by
understanding what exactly is arduino
and followed by that we will get started
with top arduino projects for 2022
and once we are done with the top
montana projects we will understand the
fundamental differences between arduino
and raspberry pi i hope i made myself
clear with the agenda now without
further ado let's get started with the
first topic that is what exactly is
arduino all to our experts in this video
we will be discussing about arduino
projects the different domains where
arduino can be used and how
let's look at today's agenda
we'll first look at locking projects
using arduino then we will look at some
of the rover projects using arduino
game projects using arduino then
automation projects using arduino
followed by which we will look at
robotics projects and help projects
then we will look at some of the drone
projects audio projects iot projects and
lastly we will look at sensor projects
using arduino
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell like so you never
miss an update from simpler
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
blocking projects using arduino
frequently we need to secure a space in
our home or business so that no one can
enter without our permission and our
valuable accessories and assets are
protected from theft or loss
there are many different types of
security systems available today
but they all rely on fingerprints retina
scanners ir scanners face id tongue
scanners rfid readers password pins
patterns and other biometrics for
authentication
the most cost effective solution is to
utilize an arduino-based password or pin
based system
some of the locking projects using
arduino are arduino door lock system
rfid and keyboard lock system
we have unlocked door with knock system
push button lock system and gesture
control log using arduino
then we have rover projects using
arduino
the arduino robot is the world's first
arduino powered vehicle on each of
robot's two boards there are two cpus
the motor board is in charge of the
motors while the control board is in
charge of reading sensors and deciding
how to run them
each board is a complete arduino board
that can be programmed using arduino ide
using arduino we can create many rover
projects like voice control rover
line follower rover
gesture control rover
survey rover
ir remote control rover
and similarly
we have autonomous rover and many more
game projects using arduino
some remarkable arduino based game
projects ranging from retro gaming
played on a limited screen to more
sophisticated projects requiring some
assembly some of the arduino gaming
projects are
snake game
then we have chess game
pinball
spaceship simulator
and claw machine
automation projects using arduino
the robust characteristics of arduino
are well suited to a popular section of
applications that is automation
the arduino board can be used to create
a wide variety of automation
applications
automation has brought convenience to
whole new level from controlling room
lights with your smartphone to
automatically organizing events instead
of using mechanical switches you can now
operate all of your home electronics
from the palm of your hand
some of the automation projects using
arduino are
home automation and sanitizer dispenser
automated shower boiler
automatic motion sensor trash
and ir remote controller home appliances
health projects using arduino
any medical equipment that has internet
connectivity and can measure one or more
health data of a patient who is
connected to the device such as
heartbeat body temperature blood
pressure ecg steps etc is referred to as
arduino based patient health monitoring
system
if there is a rapid change in patients
health the equipment can record and
transmit the data
iot encompasses everything from smart
watches to fitness tracker to hospital
equipment that can link to the internet
arduino-based health projects have been
developed to create new medical gadgets
it may be used to measure body factors
such as ecg temperature moisture and
heartbeat it also identifies the
patient's physical state and location
some of the health projects using
arduino are
smart bridge band smart bioware
portable ecg
ultrasonic site
and smart health kit
drone projects using arduino
drone are airborne vehicles that range
in size from micro to multi-rotor
quadcopters a camera is sometimes
included with a drone allowing the users
to watch and record the bird's eye
perspective
a drone is made up of numerous parts one
of the most significant of which is the
flight controller which acts as the
drone's brain
the arduino development board is great
for this purpose especially because
there are variety of models available
ranging from the tiny arduino nano to
arduino mega all of which are small
enough to fit into the design of a drone
some of the drone projects using arduino
are
quadcopter
autopilot drone
mind control drone
guide power drone
and hover craft

creators to create connected products
quickly easily and securely multiple
devices can be linked together and data
can be exchanged in real time you can
also keep an eye on them using a simple
user interface from anywhere
some of the iot or bluetooth projects
using arduino are
iot bicycle radar iot pet feeder
telegram bot
arduino bluetooth camera and smart
parking system
sensor projects using arduino
one of the aspects that make an arduino
so valuable is the simplicity with which
it can retrieve sensor information
sensors are devices that transform a
physical quantity into an electrical
quantity such as light intensity or
temperature
the different types of sensors that are
available are
light sensor motion sensor temperature
sensor magnetic field sensor gravity
sensor humidity sensor
moisture vibration and pressure sensor
electrical field sensor sound sensor and
position sensor
manufacturing machinery aircraft
vehicles medicine and robotics are just
few of the use cases of these sensors
so the different sensor projects that
can be made using arduino are
temperature monitoring
smoke detection using gas sensor
3d scanner
smart plant incubator and water quality
monitoring system
in this video we will be discussing
about raspberry pi projects
the raspberry pi has a wide range of
uses
the microcomputer has grown to
accomplish many odd activities in
addition to many standard tasks
raspberry pi was created with the intent
of allowing people to play with the
circuit board and to aid in the
development of new computing skills
the internet is huge amount of
information about the raspberry pi's
various applications and projects
as well as recommendations on how to
execute them
we will go over a few projects that
demonstrate the microcomputer's wide
range of capabilities
this video will show you the most
popular and useful projects
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply now
so without any further ado let's get
started
the first project is web server
the raspberry pi serves as a web server
for multiple users
there are numerous web server packages
to choose from however in the most
circumstances the raspberry pi's
performance is insufficient for reliably
hosting large amount of dynamic online
content
instead the mini computer is
significantly better suited for local
testing environment simple static
websites with low visitor accounts on
the other hand might be hosted on
raspberry pi server
scanner server
setting up your raspberry pi as a
scanner server using same is a terrific
way to bring your old scanner up to date
instead of purchasing a wi-fi capable
scanner you can use a device like
raspberry pi 0 to provide that
capabilities scanner access now easy is
the acronym for same this program serves
as a standardized method of gaining
access to the scanners
xbox cloud gaming on raspberry pi
microsoft's xbox cloud gaming service
allows you to stream various video games
from their servers to another device
in this project we will be streaming
these games from the xbox cloud gaming
service to the raspberry pi
using the chromium web browser you can
broadcast xbox cloud gaming to your
raspberry pi in a reasonably simple
manner
this project will even show you how to
turn your raspberry pi into pure xbox
cloud gaming machine
the xbox cloud gaming service isn't the
only game streaming option for your
raspberry pi you can also broadcast
games to use pi using google's gaming
service
game console
we can turn your raspberry pi into a
retro gaming console also we can now
simulate practically any classic game
from 1970s to the 1990s using this
little computer
retropie a piece of software that solves
all of your emulation needs is now
available it's simple piece of software
to setup and it also offers a user
friendly interface
you may now play old games with retropie
you can use any raspberry pi model for
this project however the raspberry pi 4
model such as the raspberry pi model 4b
that is 4gb is strongly recommended
remote control 3d printer
octoprint which is one of the most well
known 3d printing program can also be
used on raspberry pi this software lets
you collect statistics and even monitor
your 3d printer from afar
this software lets you collect
statistics and even monitor your 3d
printer from afar
you can now control your 3d printer
remotely rather than using an sd card
aside from that you can connect a webcam
to a 3d printer to monitor the progress
of your printing
you will need a wi-fi adapter like the
model tl
wn725n to make your 3d printer work
because you will need to connect it to
the internet
language translator
this project necessitates some coding
and programming experience
we can utilize the google translate
library or any other python translating
tool to make this project much easier
you will need to know how to set up text
to speech speech recognition translation
apis and so on because this project has
many layers
overall it's still a worthwhile project
that you can do with your raspberry pi
and add to your achievements of
raspberry pi projects
security camera
you may have observed that different
raspberry pi models are compatible with
different camera modules
the raspberry pi 8 megapixel camera
module for example is only compatible
with raspberry pi 1 2 and 3 versions
you may now make your own security
camera for your home with this camera
model another advantage of this project
is that you can add whatever other
features you like
for example we can access video feeds
from afar and have them immediately
uploaded to a server for backup
a number of package or library
prerequisites are already available on
the internet on your raspberry pi you
can simply download or alter it
wi-fi extender
a wi-fi extender is another simple
project it's a low cost and effective
solution to increase wifi range
if you have a bad wifi signal in your
garden or even your room you may utilize
your raspberry pi to boost your signal
it's an excellent substitute for
commercial wi-fi repeater furthermore
because this is a diy project you can
always alter it and add new features
because this job has already been
completed by many people you can just
search the internet for the finest and
most convenient way to complete it
running android tv on raspberry pi
android tv is specialized version of
google's famous mobile operating system
it has a
in revised face that better accommodates
the horizontal nature of television
screens
because the operating system is better
suited to white horizontal screens and
remote controls it's the best option for
connecting the pi to your tv the google
play store also gives you access to many
downloadable apps
the most significant difficulty with
running android tv on a raspberry pi
right now is that builds lack hardware
video decoding and encoding capabilities
the pi 4 mod will be pi 400 and the
compute module 4 are the only devices
that can run android tv
running zoom on the raspberry pi
we can utilize the feature to set up
meetings so that people can readily
connect with you
the individual hosting the meeting on
the other hand will need their own zoom
account
the person who creates a meeting has the
authority to determine who is allowed to
speak and share resources such as the
computer screen
with the free plan you can connect up to
100 additional individuals for total of
40 minutes because the raspberry pi does
not contain any arm binaries it is
difficult to run zoom on it
we will use a handy piece of software
called box 86 to get around this
box 86 is an emulation program that
transforms
86 instructions to arm instruction set
which the raspberry pi recognizes
raspberry pi bluetooth speakers
you may greatly expand the capabilities
of your raspberry pi by connecting it to
a set of speakers
this project gives you the opportunity
to stream audio directly to any vintage
speakers or hi-fi system making them
more modern
we can add support for apple airplay
spotify connect and synchronize multiple
room audio to raspberry pi in addition
to bluetooth audio
we are going to utilize a balina image
named balinas sound to bring all of
these extra capabilities to our
raspberry pi
this instruction from balina greatly
simplifies the setup process and should
lessen the chances of making mistakes
home assistant using raspberry pi
home assistant is an open source home
automation program that was created
using raspberry pi based device the
software was created with the goal of
protecting your privacy and retaining
control in the hands of the user
you can monitor the status of all of
your devices in your house with the home
assistant you can even automate your
interactions with them
we can program home assistant to turn on
all of the lights automatically when it
gets dark and you're at home when you
cast a movie on your chromecast you can
even program it to dim the lights in
your giving room
raspberry pi is an excellent platform
for home automation it's compact
inexpensive has many networking
functions and consumes little power
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free

for this project we need to install a
custom version of minecraft designed
just for raspberry pi minecraft pi
edition is a name of this version of
minecraft
this version of minecraft is much older
than the current version it does however
have an advantage it is entirely free
additionally this version of minecraft
includes a python library for
interacting with the game environment
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on top arduino projects for
2022. if you have any queries regarding
any of the topics covered in this

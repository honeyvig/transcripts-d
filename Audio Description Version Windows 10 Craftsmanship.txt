A white rectangular computer
prompt flashes on a dark screen.
It pulses in time to the music.
Words typed on the screen read, we
don't build Windows for all of us.
We build Windows for each of us.
Windows Accessibility
Program Managers.
>> When you build features for
people that have a range of
abilities, you end up making
something that works for everybody.
>> For me one of the amazing things,
even today
after 15 years at Microsoft, is how
we're inventing new experiences.
>> When we sat down we were
focusing on those with low vision
and no vision.
We decided really we need
to work on performance.
To start Narrator, I'm gonna
hold down the Windows key and
press Enter.
>> Window, start window, search box.
>> So right now we're at about 80%
of capacity of how Narrator could
speak, and this is about how
I would use my computer.
That probably sounds like gibberish
but once you get used to this,
it's pretty quick.
>> One of the things that we spent a
lot of time looking at is how do you
really help a developer be immersed
in what it means to be blind.
We built in the developer
mode in Narrator.
>> Caps lock, shift,
developer mode enabled.
>> So now you can see that
we've blanked the screen.
So I'm gonna press h to
jump to the first header.
>> Heading level one,
go to Bing home page.
>> And it will kind of immerse
you in what that is like to
not see your app.
Select down to change
to suggestions view.
>> Across many applications,
when you're typing,
whether it's weather, news, Cortana.
You're getting search suggestions.
>> Fond du Lac, one of one selected.
>> It's the first time that we're
building that level of accessibility
into both our screen reader and
our applications.
>> I'm going to flag this message.
>> Content, delete button.
Move button.
Set flag button.
>> Xbox looked closely at
how they can diversify
how people represent themselves.
And so you'll see a new set of
avatars so that someone can select
an avatar that looks more
closely to themselves.
>> So wth Windows 10, the Edge team
really wanted to do our part and
make accessibility great on the web.
>> Enter, hub.
>> Whether they need the screen
reader, whether it's high contrast,
whether it's keyboard only.
>> At level 3, draggable.
>> It was really about
making it more usable and
more intuitive for all of our users.
>> So in the future, I think the key
is really matching the ability
of the technology to
the ability of the person.
So everybody can participate.
>> Kids curve their fingers into
heart shapes over their chests.

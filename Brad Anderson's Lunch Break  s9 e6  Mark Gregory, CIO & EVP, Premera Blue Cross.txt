- It's lunch time and this is
Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
Here in Redmond we're visited
by some of the smartest
people on the planet.
Pretty much every day.
Every chance I get I meet
up with them for lunch.
(upbeat music)
Today I talked to a very smart
guy who gets his hair cut
at the same place I do.
Mark Gregory the CIO
of Premera Blue Cross.
So you're here from Premara
- Yeah
- located right here in Seattle.
You guys are the biggest
provider of insurance
in the Northwest.
- Yeah.
- I didn't realize this but
Premera is 85 years old.
So what's it like working
for a company like that,
has these incredibly old
roots and history and culture
going through the digital transformation.
- The history is great.
Companies that have been around
a long time like Premera,
our challenge is to take
care of all the technology
that got us where we are.
- Mm-hmm.
- But also advance it and
get prepared for the future.
There's four basic problems
we see in health care.
The first one is, I don't
get the care I need.
Second one is I get care I don't need.
- Yeah.
- Which is waste but also
- Well it's time
- Can be dangerous.
- Sure exactly.
- Right.
The third one is really around value.
I pay a lot, do I really
get value for what I pay?
And the fourth one, Brad,
is experience right.
So how many times have you
had a bad experience with
health care of some type?
Part of what we try to do at
Premera and how we leverage
technology is to solve those four issues.
- So how do you use some
of the technology that
address those four concerns?
- We sit on large quantities of data.
- Yeah.
- Right? So, if I can or we
collectively at Premera
can engage the customer
with tools that let them
see their options right.
Where can they get the best value
for their healthcare dollar?
Where can they go to get the
best health care outcome?
Right? And that all comes through
data and engagement tools
to help them solve that problem.
Also on our side, how do
we help lead them there?
- Not only do we have the same haircut,
(laughs)
but we also share, you
know we have names that are
fairly common. So I did
a search on LinkedIn
and there were multiple
Mark Gregorys that I found.
- Right.
- So let's play "Which one are you?"
- Okay.
(laughs)
- Do you play keyboard
in the band Hot Tub?
- I do not.
- Back in the early 2000
did you own a small chain
of Pizza restaurants in Alaska?
- I did not.
- Did you have a role in the movie
Adam and Eve, Meet the Cannibals?
- Oh man, no.
I wish I did though.
Didn't that sound like a great experience?
- Seriously right?
- I'm tellin' you man, there
is a lot more interesting
Mark Gregorys out there than me clearly.
- Next time on Brad Anderson's Lunch Break
- When we introduced
Cloud to the organization
we did not introduce it as a cost play.
We introduced it as a value play.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really, right? So how
quickly can I bring up
the capabilities that move
the organization forward.
I wanna bring it up
lighter, quicker, faster.
And then I want more options with it.

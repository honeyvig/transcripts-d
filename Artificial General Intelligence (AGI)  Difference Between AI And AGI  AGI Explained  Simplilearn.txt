hey everyone welcome back to our Channel
today we are diving into the exciting
and somewhat Mysterious World of
artificial general intelligence or AGI
AGI is all about creating software that
doesn't just follow a set of rules but
thinks and learns like a human imagine
an AI that can teach itself new skills
and Tackle task it's never seen before
that's pretty cool right right now most
a systems are pretty specialized they
can do amazing things like recognize
faces and photos or translate languages
but they can't switch gears and do
something completely different AGI aims
to change that by developing AI that can
understand learn and adapt across
various Fields just like we do and in
this video we will break down what makes
AGI so different from the AI we are used
to we'll talk about how AG strives to
mimic human intelligence with the
ability to solve problems in any domain
not just the one it's trained for we
also explore some of the approaches
researchers are taking to make AGI a
reality and from symbolic methods that
use logic networks to connectionist
approaches that mimic the brain's neural
networks and even Hybrid models that
combine the best of both World Plus
we'll look at The Cutting Edge
technologies that are pushing AGI
research forward we'll discuss deep
learning generative AI natural language
processing computer vision and Robotics
these tools are helping us get closer to
building truly intelligent machines but
it's not all creating AI comes with big
challenges like teaching AI to make
connections across different areas
understand emotions and perceive the
world like we do so stick around as we
unravel the complexities and
possibilities of artificial general
intelligence if you enjoy our content

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start here's a quick
info for you if you want to learn Ai and
ml from the industry experts then try
simply learns postgraduate program in Ai
and machine learning from per University
in collaboration with IBM this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP computer
vision reinforcement learning generative

more so don't forget to check out the

pinc commit so without any further Ado
let's get started so now we'll start
with artificial general intelligence so
AGI is a field of AI research focused on
creating software with humanik
intelligence and self-learning
capabilities the goal is for the
software to perform task it wasn't
specially trained for unlike current AI
Technologies which operate within
predefined parameter
example an AI trained for image
recognition can't build websites AGI
aims to develop systems with autonomous
self-control self- understanding and the
ability to learn new skills to solve
complex problems in various context AGI
remains a theoretical concept and
research objective so now let's
understand the difference between
artificial intelligence and artificial
general intelligence so AI enable
software to perform task like human
level performance often excelling in
specific areas like a summar is
extracting key points from documents and
in contrast AGI systems can solve
problems across multiple domains like a
human without manual intervention self-
teing and handling task they weren't
initially trained for an AGI is a
theortical representation of
comprehensive AI with generalized human
cognitive abilities and today's AI
systems require substantial training for
specific task unlike AGI which aims to
handle unfamiliar task independently so
now we'll see the theoretical approaches
to artificial general intelligence
research so there are several methods
that drive AI research focusing on
replicating human cognitive processes
number one process is symbolic that uses
logic networks to represent human
thoughts interpreting ideas at a higher
level then comes connectionist that
emulates the human brain structure with
neural networks aiming for humanlike
intelligence and low-level cognitive
capabilities and then come Universalist
that address AGI complexities at the Cal
calculation level formulating
theoretical solutions for practical AJ
systems and then we have hybrid that
combines symbolic and sub symbolic
methods to achieve results Beyond a
single approach and now we'll see the
technologies that drive artificial
general intelligence research so AI
research is propelled by several
emerging Technologies coming to number
one that is deep learning it trains
neural networks with multiple layers to
understand complex relationships from
row data useful for text audio image and
video analysis then we have Genera VI
that produces unique and realistic
content from learn knowledge responding
to human queries with text audio or
visuals and then we have NLP that allows
system to understand and generate human
language using computational Linguistics
and machine learning and after that we
have computer vision that extracts and
comprehends spal information from visual
data automating task like object
recognition and classification and after
that we have Rob robotics that builds
mechanical systems for physical task
essential for ai's sensory perception
and physical manipulation capabilities
and after that we'll see the
applications of artificial general
intelligence and number one is
Healthcare so AJ systems can analyze
vast medical records for Diagnostics
treatment planning and Drug Discovery
they also enable personalized Medicine
by tailoring treatments based on an
individuals genetic makeup and medical
history The Next Step application is
finance AI can revolutionize investment
strategies risk management fraud
detection and algorithmic trading by
making faster and more precise decisions
through real-time analysis of market
trends and economic data the next
application is education AI can
personalize learning experiences by
adapting to each student's unique needs
and learning styles creating specialized
resources and using natural language
processing to clarify Concepts and after
that we have manufacturing so AGI enhanc
manufacturing efficiency and
predictability by forecasting equipment
failures and conducting quality control
and analyzing sensor data and production
metrics to identify cost saving and
efficiency opportunities in real time so
now we'll see the challenges in
artificial general intelligence research
so the number one challenge is make
connections so current AI models are
domain specific and can't apply
knowledge across domains unlike humans
who adapt knowledge to various context
then comes emotional intelligence so
human creativity and emotional responses
are challenging to replicate with neural
networks which generate outputs based on
trained data patterns and then we have
sensory perception so AI requires
advanced technology to perceive the
world accurately differentiating shapes
colors taste smells and sounds like
humans so now we'll see the future of
artificial general intelligence that is
Agi so the future is in technological
advancements so the rise of AI and
cognitive Sciences makes AGI ACH
tangible part of daily life so now
coming to Second point the second
advancement would be convergence of
Technologies so interdisciplinary
efforts combining AI Robotics and
biotechnology May accelerate the
development of AGI and then we have
augmented intelligence so AGI has the
potential to enhance human capabilities
and accelerate problem solving with its
creative power and now we have new
interactive paradigms so Advanced
natural language processing will enable
more intuitive interactions between
humans and machines revolutionizing
communication and after that the new
advancement is scientific discovery
acceleration so AGI could speed up
scientific processes by taking over data
analysis and intellectual task and in
conclusion artificial general
intelligence AGI is a groundbreaking
technology with the potential to
transform societies worldwide however
developing AGI is challenging and raises
significant ethical questions despite
its complexity a can address many of
Humanity's problems and Drive Innovation
if approached responsibility AI could
become a Monumental achievement for
Humanity if its development and use are

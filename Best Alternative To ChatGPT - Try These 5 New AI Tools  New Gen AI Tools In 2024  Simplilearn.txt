in Ai and machine learning you can find
the course Link in the description box
and pin comments so let's get started so
number one we have Gemini so first let's
set up Gemini correctly so if you're
using a personal Google account go to
extensions and you can activate
workspace and YouTube so go to settings
go to
extensions so right now we need only
Google workspace and YouTube so I have
already added those extensions and you
can disable the other extensions which
you don't need for time being so the
thing is with extensions enabled you can
use the edge shortcut for commands like
Gmail Google Docs Google Drive and
YouTube so initially it seems like a
gimmick but it turns out to be a real
time saer so let's see an
example so in Gmail we can actually use
Gemini to search for emails on specific
topics like for instance let's just try
out at
gmail show the latest email from
LinkedIn
so as you can see Gemini filters out and
finds exactly what you need and you can
also open these emails in new tabs
directly from Gemini itself which makes
it super
convenient so similarly you can fet your
documents of files from Google Drive and
Google Docs also in the same way so you
can try it out so now Gemini also excels
in more advanced tasks like for instance
you can paste a chart into Gemini and
ask for key insights or if you have a
table in non-editable format like a PDF
just screenshot it paste it into Gemini
and request the data in a table format
and also with YouTube Gemini can analyze
videos so now let's see an example of
that we can just analyze a
video
sorry
at
YouTube and uh
we'll just analyze a video analyze this
video and provide the video
link so as you can see this will give
you insights about what the video talks
about and you can also summarize long
videos to get the main points without
watching the entire content so isn't
that really cool actually so from here
if you want you can access the original
video also so Gemini user friendly
features include default prompt
suggestions and response modifications
also so you can also interact via voice
or listen to the responses by clicking
on the microphone and speaker icons and
also you can share your prompts and
responses publicly or pin high quality
outputs for easy reference so this is
especially useful for keeping track of
your best performing prompts now next we
have notebook LM so notebook LM is an AI
powered notebook designed to help you
ask questions about your research and
organize your ideas more effectively so
it's powered by Google's latest AI model
Gemini so to get started let's create a
new notebook so you can title your
Notebook based on your specific topic so
for instance I'll create a notebook for
all the machine learning research so
I'll just title it as machine
learning so notebook LM allows you to
add sources from Google Drive upload PDF
documents text files or even paste text
directly so these sources are stored on
the left side of the interface so here
is your left side of the interface so
you can add the sources and actually you
know add the documents from these so you
can actually add up to 20 different
files each containing up to 200,000
words so this means you have a total of
4 million words in your sources so now
let's add some documents from PDF and
see how it works so we'll just add a
PDF machine learning PDF
so as you can see it actually provided
you a summary of what contains in your
document so now the real power of
notebook LM comes from its AI
capabilities so the search box that you
can see in the center actually uses
Gemini to pull information only from
your sources which ensures accuracy so
let's type a query like give me the key
insights and let's see what happens give
me the key
insights and see how it extracts data
from our sources Pro iding citations so
you can track back the information so if
you found useful information you can
also pin the notes for easy access so
notebook LM also suggest followup Proms
and allows you to take notes so
collaboration is seamless with notebook
LM so you can share your notebooks with
others similar to Google Drive sheets
and dogs so simply add people notify
them or copy the link for them to access
your research so notebook Elms massive
context window and precise data handling
make it a fantastic tool for research
and note taking now let's talk about
project asra project asra is an
Innovative prototype from Google Deep
Mind pushing the boundaries of AI
assistance building on the advanced
Gemini models Astra AI agents that
designed to seamlessly handle multimodel
information understand context and
engage in natural conversational
exchanges the key features of project
Astra are number one multimodel
processing Astra is adept at processing
and understanding diverse types of
information including images diagrams
and text allowing it to integrate and
interpret data from multiple sources SES
number two contextual reasoning these AI
agents excel in contextual reasoning
offering relevant and coherent responses
based on the context of the conversation
which enhances the overall interaction
quality number three natural language
interaction estri engages users in
conversational style making interactions
feel more intuitive and humanlike
thereby improving user experience and
number four rapid response the system is
designed for quick information
processing and response formul
ensuring that interactions are smooth
and efficient so Google Deep Mind has
released several demonstrations to
Showcase project as stress capabilities
let's have a look at them number one is
interpreting drawings from literature
asra can identify famous books and
complex Concepts based on simple
sketches highlighting its ability to
understand and reason about visual
inputs um can you tell me what this
famous thought experiment might be and
explain it to me in one sentence
that looks like the ship of Theus
thought experiment it questions whether
an object that has had all of its
components replaced remains
fundamentally the same
object can you give me a creative poem
about these
objects a vibrant orb a mind laid bear
time silent passage fills the air the
fruit of thought the Sands that fall
what Memories will it recall
now comes memorizing sequences of
objects asra and remember and recognize
specific items from a list such as
identifying a yellow loopy object
demonstrating its Proficiency in
recalling and processing visual
information hey I'm going to show you
some objects just do your best to
remember
them sounds fun I'm ready I'm pretty
good at remembering things so go
ahead okay then name every object I just
showed you
okay okay let's see there was a seashell
a crab figurine a spiky gold ball a
yellow glass spear a goldfish and
finally a little potted
plant good job so these examples
underscore est's Advanced ability to
understand and interpret both Visual and
textual information providing accurate
and insightful responses now next on the
list is music AI sandbox so music AI

so this is dr. Steven from Team MDS
conquer yesterday the result was out and
I'm getting so many messages calls both
from the aspirants as well as from the
parents by having so many enquiries and
this video is basically to answer most
of your questions for your question
marks in your brain okay so I hope this
video is going to help you so first of
all I am very very happy about the
result that MDS conquer has banned all
India second-ranked
okay that is so Mia has made it and we
are very very happy for that and apart
from this we made many decent ranks this
year and officially this is the only
online Institute in the entire country
making single digits every year okay
from 2018 we made third 2019 we made
fourth and 2020 this year we made all
India second so congratulations to all
the aspirants for their dedicated work
which has converted into success
yesterday and I am just going to give a
rough analysis of yesterday's scoring's
okay if you just take the first mark
okay the first mark
[Music]
okay if you take the first mark and
yesterday's exam it is 779 and if you
take the second mark that is biome Diaz
conquer student it is 776 so this is a
rough analysis as already discussed you
need to go for the maximum attempt and
this maximum item has worked for so many
students even if you feel that there is
lots of negative marking in your scoring
system it is the positive only because
maximum attempt is always a better
option as one analyst called on the
group but if you if you see the cutoff
zone zone for the GDS he could have
shown for the GDC it is almost same as
the last year okay the kind of marks
were same as last year but there is lots
of accumulation of students around the
zone of 600 so if you take the rough
analysis of scores six hundred marks the
topper is 779 and if you take a score of
600 there thousand people who has made
six hundred marks in the yesterday's
exam
yesterday's result and if you take six
hundred and five score okay there nine
hundred people means just just just one
mark just five marks means five marks
means logically speaking one wrong mcq
is converted if you one wrong mcq is
converted into right okay you will get
plus one and you will get plus four so
you will get five means it's just a
matter of one mcq which has converted
thumbs and ranks okay so this is a high
computation Journal already said okay
most of you will be in the high
competition zone and fetching your mark
or fetching five marks is very very
important at this face and that clearly
reflects in their study score this may
not help out for the people who are
already done with the exam but this
video is going to help for the people
who are preparing for the next year or
people who are preparing for the
upcoming aims PGI and chipper
you can clearly see that a score of 600
the rank is thousand and a score of six
not five where it's it's a matter of 1m
secured the rank has changed drifted by
100 in number you can imagine hundred in
member is a lot one mcq is very very
minor thing but one mcq turning 200 is a
very very huge thing that everyone has
to make a note ok so once we are done
with this 600 and 600 and 5 so you can
see the comparison ok 600 you get
thousand rank 605 you get 900 rank ok
and if you see 613 score you get 800
right and the difference between 605 to
613 just 8 marks means is to MCQs then
two more MCQs from 900 you will be
pushed to 800 rank or 3 MCQs from 600
you'll be pushed 2,000 to 800 rank so
matter of 2 to 3 MCQs there is a
variation of 200 rank in just thousand
students ok the total crowd has given
the exam roughly somewhere around 25 27
to 28 thousand and if you see the
computation zone the people who has
banned 600 plus a thousand and six
hundred and thirteen it's a matter of 3
MCQs the rank will be 800 so you should
be very very very very focused about
this variation and the competitor zone
the most of the competitors own I feel
like 675 will be a good area if you see
675 675
675 the rank was 200 and if you see the
difference sorry
and if you see the difference between
613 and 675 just 50 marks means it's
just 10 MCQs means if you get a score of
613 where your rank is 800 if you get
ten MEMC Q's right from here your rank
will be 200 I'm 100% sure that you will
end up with a good GDC if your rank is
below 200 and I'm very sure even if we
get 613 it's a very good rank according
to me by analyzing so many students in
the past few years even 800 rank is a
good run but these 10m seekers means
they're not the sternum seekers very
sick 800 rank how the recognization of a
student will be faking if he or she got
800 rank how the resignation of a
student will be if he got he or she got
201 you know the recognization levels
you know the appreciation levels okay
right 200 rank is going to get a good
Judy see with a good staff and we're 800
rank if they want CDC they have to
repeat the exam again 10 MCQs is going
to cost so much and this is not a
particular analysis that is only like
you can apply for the studies result or
this need it is a common application for
almost all the need exams maybe next
year
no need to prepare a separate video I
can just pause this video because the
analysis will be almost same roughly the
analysis will be almost same so please
do make the present interns or the
present batch people and the people who
are planning to repeat the exempt very
very important every point what is being
discussed on the group or every point
what is being posted here and there or
every point from your basic mcq books is
very very important for your preparation
because it is a matter of one or two
MCQs or a maximum 10 MCQs that's going
to play a very vital role to decide
whether you are on other side or you are
on the zone of success
okay I don't want to discuss most about
the top 100 list but I want to discuss
about this cutoff John okay you need to
get 675 in this question paper to get
the best even if you get anything less
than this you are going to have some bad
experience and my to my presence all the
people who has been in top 1,500 will
have same IQ level so will have the same
abilities it's all about your presence
of mind the examination hall and it's a
bit of matter of luck when you do your
question paper and rest all was the same
okay so my citation for the people who
are on the on other side is don't get
depressed it is it's it's a game who
played the player there I mean it around
27,000 people has played and out of
which if you're in the top 1500 or if
your top hunt thousand list or if your
top 2,000 list also it's an achievement
27,000 you are in the top two thousand
it's an achievement don't get depressed
don't always compare with one it's not
one who always wins the game okay it's
not one who always wins the game
whatever is your ability and whatever is
your rank is an achievement for you you
may keep your target for 200 you may
keep your target for hundred but make
sure whatever you are rewarded with is
an achievement even 5,000 rank is also
an achievement according to me because
27,000 people out of which you made
5,000 it's an achievement so don't get
depressed or don't get demotivated it's
it's of course it's a mind game where
your presence of mind and your logical
way of thinking will play a high-level
role and of course it's an unexpected
question paper okay most of the people
they have given it as a review as a
tough paper but whatever maybe we are
done with the exam now the result is out
so don't get demotivated if you're
planning to take a move take em or
whether it may be an MDS MDS is one of
the option after medias
don't think MDS is only the life and if
you have any plans you can go ahead if
you don't have any plan
if you want to stick on to MDS you find
the options whatever that are available
for your particular rank and if you
don't find any options okay and if you
are planning to restart the preparation
start as early as possible this is what
most of the people they do because I can
give two or three examples like last
year students who has banked somewhere
around two thousand or drank and they
have waited for all the rounds of
counseling which took somewhere around
four months and they have started the
preparation in the last five to six
months and I think last five to six
months preparation for this range of
paper or this difficulty level of paper
is impossible to crack this sign they
have made from 2000 they have made 3000
to 4000 ranks in this second round okay
so if you want to start the preparation
start early don't wait for the
counseling's to take place let okay you
can apply for the counseling comes
applique applying for counseling is
different scenario I play for the
counseling if you get something good and
if you are comfortable with that you can
take it you can't with the preparation
then but don't give a pause to your
preparation or don't stop the
preparation and in the counseling
because that is going to hurt you on the
day of result next year so please take
this advice as a prime thing okay
because it's hurting so many people in
the last few years and I don't want this
to happen for you in specific okay so
the next one is the next important thing
I want to discuss is a few people
they're planning for because I think you
one more example one for fruitful
example there's one of my friend who's
done with MDS and he has given the exam
just to clear the army okay so what are
how analysis from that specific
individual is is good at basics you
don't have a very hard code reparation
hardly has referred the book for last 10
to 15 or maximum 15 to 20 days okay but
finally he made 500 rank in the list and
I feel surprised after seeing 500 rank
and I know that he is very strong in the
basics and the perfect analysis from my
side is if you are strong in the basics
okay and even if you have hardly one or
two months of preparation it is very
easy to crack five hundred or thousand
below rank okay but make sure you should
be very strong in the basics of all the
subjects so this is the rough analysis
of the scoring's in the Esther days
result and the next comes is the
cut-offs or the qualifying marks and if
you if I list out the qualifying marks
this qualifying marks are the list that
is given in the during the counseling
and this may be modified or revised
basing upon the all India ranks after
one one one and half month or 45 days
time but right now the cutoff they have
given further the cutoff they have given
for the OSI is somewhere around they
have given a cutoff of somewhere around
fifty personnel is the cutoff and the
cutoff marks 286 for 286 the rank was
somewhere around 12,000 okay so out of
27,000 people who has given exam in the
first official round only 12,000 people
means less than 50 percentage of the
people has qualified the exam qualifying
the exam is 50% design out of which even
if you bank a rank of 6,000 or 5,000
don't get demotivated with the rank it
may be a good drawing for an intern
according to me even five making 5,000
rank is a good rank for an intern who is
a tenth grade the first attempt because
if you take take the analysis or the
mode of preparation in the last five
years in the last I mean like five years
back intense regularly they don't
prepare for the examinations okay they
take a break and this restart the
vibration if you list out the toppers in
the in the top 100 or the 200 list every
year most of them are repeaters it's not
the intense game it's a repeaters game
but nowadays we can see a few interns
here and there you can see the all-india
second rancor is an intern okay - last
year we have many people who are in the
top 200 list has an intense and 2018
neat all-india third rancor is again an
intern okay nowadays you can see interns
but interns do not get big
degraded or depressed with your ranks
okay it says something like a
challenging thing that you need to take
this as a positive sense into
consideration you need to work on your
weak points and you need to make
something better okay so for SC category
ST category and for OBC the cutoff
percentile is 40 40 percentile and the
score is 250 marks and the rank is
somewhere I don't know 16,000 and if it
is a physically handicapped
it is 45 percentile and the score is 268
okay and it is somewhere around 14,500
okay these things may be revised and I
mean these scores are basically like
used to by a management quarter seat or
may be used for few deemed colleges as a
criteria to pick the students on and
this may be revised within 45 days or 60
days basing upon some criteria okay so
the revised thing will be again uploaded
or updated on your group so don't worry
about that so the last one that I want
to discuss right now is means few people
they started pinging me about the
opportunities or what what we need to go
ahead how we need to do is what what I
can say is simply like your dental
treatment it's all like wait and watch
okay because within few days you are
you're all India ranks will be I mean
you're 50 percentile ranks will be out
that 50% Ezell dranks is just
eliminating the Jammu and Kashmir
students who are not a part of your all
india counseling so you will get some
some rank okay which may be or which may
be same as the present rank or which may
be slightly by 10 or 15 less than the
present rank okay so that's first okay
that's the first step that within few
days you will get your all India 50 plus
50 percent is Bronx were eligible for
the counseling and next comes is after
few days you will get your statements
okay after few days you'll get straight
ranks but if you take Andhra and
Telangana or any other space
state-specific
into consideration you can get to our
with the state counselling you can get
your position of ST and SC but you
cannot get the position of the
subdivisions of BC because in Andhra and
Telangana you have a b c a b c BB CC b c
d and BCE right so you can get your OBC
rank with the with the state lines that
are posted by the need but you cannot
get your individual category one that is
very very important in deciding your
department or anything huh okay so this
is the next level means SC ST people
they can get an idea like where they
stand among the list but OBC you will
get an OBC rank but not your individual
category ranks I hope you are very clear
so then the third level this is almost
common for every state okay then the
state they are going to release a
notification state notification will be
released and all the students who are
interested for the state counseling they
need to apply the state counseling with
your knee trunk okay then after few days
of the state comes state notification
that straight people state people they
are going to release statement list
state ranking will be different state
merit list will be different the
difference between the state ranking in
state merit list is state merit list is
for the people who has applied in the
particular state for the state
counseling and state ranking is for all
the students who has given the exam they
are going to give statements but state
merit list is different and that is more
important rather than the statement
because all the students in the state
may not appear for the counselor because
few people they may take in all India
there may be skipping the state
counseling few people they can take it
deemed universities they're going to
skip the state counseling and few people
they may have plans of repeating the
exam they are going to skip the state
counselor okay so once the state merit
list is out then you will know where you
stand in BCA where you stand in BC B
where you start
BC C D and E so basing upon this before
the counseling before the counseling
online counseling start every state
including the deemed colleges they are
going to release seat matrix seat matrix
means how many seats are there in that
particular University how many seats are
there in the particular College okay
don't take the last year analysis there
are few mentors who are posting the last
year things like analyzing the last year
before last year it's it's not your MBBS
or PDS counseling where you will have
hundred seats in each College and you
can take last year analysis and
comparing these serum ounces because
yesterday I got so many calls from the
parents like they are analyzing the last
year there is no relationship between
the last year last year something will
happen this year something will happen
because there is some criteria which I
cannot discuss right now in front of I
mean in this video okay there will be
few criteria is basing upon that they
are going to release the seat matrix and
see if matrix is going to give an idea
that how many seats are there in a
particular College in a particular
department so in this particular
department how many seeds they are going
to give for an SC how many seats they
are going to give for an ST and how many
seats they're going to give for an OBC
it may be just 1 or 0 or 1 2 something
like that it's not like 20 30 40 50 like
your PDS counseling or like your MBBS
counseling if you distract e-40 if not 1
you will get the second then the last
year analysis or last last Theory
analysis can be useful but if it is just
one if a person who is in front of you
is speaking the seat there is no seat
for you so that analysis is not
applicable ok so don't follow some such
unnecessary irritating things which
which doesn't work at any cost okay so
so finally and this level is all and in
this level and for the most of the
counseling this level is again three
rounds means counseling one
you will get your allotment and if you
are reported to the college your seat
will be locked if you want you can get
updated to the second round it same goes
with your all-india counseling also the
same pattern and next you need to apply
for the counseling too if you want a
better seat than counseling one if there
is any availability you will be routed
with the counseling to seat and it goes
for the counseling three so in the
counseling round number three the seat
will be locked this is both for the
all-india or for both for the team
colleges as well as most of the things
like even for the state comes to there
are few states in specifically Kandra
and Telangana okay you have two sub
categories one is category a one is
category B the counseling for category a
is different the counseling for category
B is different
okay so counseling will be same for the
government seat for the category a one
consonant and the second round of
counseling is only specific to the
category B and that second round of
category B also takes place in three
rounds that is counseling one counseling
too and counseling three so this is a
very lengthy procedure which is going to
take a minimum duration of three to four
months to lock you see except for the
people who are in the top list for
example if there is it all-india second
ranker in our group right so she can she
can get prepared once she she de si si
just have a look over the seat Mattox
and she feels like okay proper is going
to take this sit or else like I am going
to take this seat because I am this girl
is OBC she has an OBC category the
second ranca so she can get fixed but
rest to all the people you need to get
updated from round one to round two
round two to Round three or you maybe
get updated from your like from your
private call is a category two
government call is a category or you may
get updated from beating and B category
to a category you may get updated from
one college to other colors or one
department or the department so rest all
it's a dilemma it's going to take time
seriously so don't get prepared like
this okay you can keep options like I
want to choose Indo followed by Indo I
want to choose approach to followed by
this I want to choose that you can keep
such options but you cannot decide that
I will
at this college I will be in this
particular policy it it's all like a
question mark until a particular seat is
allotted to you I hope this video has
helped you in answering many question
marks in your brain and of course I'll
be there with you you don't worry that
is basically what we do I'll just give
you I mean unofficially I'm going to
give you the list of the colleges both
for the all-india counseling and list of
the colleges for both the straight
counseling of all the states okay don't
worry about that and this is uncommon
every ship okay and I'm going to give
the give the priority order also like
which department to choose basically
choosing the department is again a big
thing or an important thing because you
cannot choose the department basing upon
the market at the present situation but
you need to choose the department basing
upon the market after three to four
years because you will be out into the
market with an MDS attack after right
after yes after three years so you need
to choose the department with some
passion and after four years you need to
analyze which department is going to
have some options for you some vacancies
for you some money-making options for
you so basing upon that you need to
select that so this will be posted as a
separate video to help out the students
apart from MDS conquer to because this
was a special request because I am
getting so many calls in the last
overnight and this today from not only
from MDS conquers in specific but most
of my students are sharing my number for
all the people who are in this over
having this big question mark so I just
want to resolve with all all my
experience or all the information that I
have so I'm just going to help you in
all the ways so don't get disheartened
and I mean hurt me I may be Billy I mean
the people who has so many people has
prepared keeping I at me as a primary
target guys don't worry army is going to
take six more months for the note
vacation to be out until that please get
relaxed because you cannot modify your
rank or else you cannot restart your
preparation now whatever rank you get
okay
stay cool stay happy okay keep your rank
aside and just try to focus on your life
and everything okay so once the
notification is out definitely we have
some beautiful plans to help you out in
both the interview as well as your
physical appearance for the army
selections okay so don't worry about
that
and the next comes is about the people
who are planning to repeat the exam make
sure start as fast as possible the few
people who got decent ranks but I got
few calls in the morning session that
they want to try for aims okay that's
that's a wonderful move that most of the
people are taking even your rank is 1500
mm you are eligible to apply for aims PJ
and jib man okay you have somewhere
around 25 or 30 odd seats which are
valid seeds and I hope everyone is
eligible to prepare for that exam and
all those are welcome because I'm
planning to start a specific focused
more focused batch for for this aims PJ
and jet mer so you've you are a tough
guy or if you are tough in preparation
let's come join the party we will have a
very very tough preparation for the
upcoming games teach it more and PJ okay
so there are many things to be discussed
I'll be coming with a few more doubts
and con I mean like it's all about
controversial things like few meant as
they say these few meant as they say
that but whatever the analysis that I
have given is specific to my point of
view in the last five to six years
experience with more than ten thousand
or less students okay so fun and last
but not the least first one I want to
congratulate each and every one who are
happy with their eyes not only in
specific to the purpose it is if you are
happy with the rank because I have seen
few people texting me calling me and
telling me sir we are very happy that I
have qualified the exam I have not
prepared well I was staying with the
group in the last 15 20 or 130 days okay
I'm very happy that I'm qualified I
never expected that
5,000 will be my rank and even I can see
that 5,000 rank student is also very
happy so that is an achievement for them
and that word of gratitude is an
achievement for me I'm not happy with
getting a single digit every year I'll
be happy when the student has fulfilled
their dream I'm getting so many calls
from the parents that my daughter has
bought 800 rank we are very happy that
will I get an industry yes of course you
may you your high chances are there 500
600 ranks five six 700 800 ranks we
gotta endorse it we are very happy yes
oh they're very happy they're
celebrating they're having a party so
that's level of achievement will be
different for different individuals not
always a single digit or or 100 below or
a 200 bit knowledge series is going to
make okay even if you are a student from
GDC or even if you're a student from any
private college you will have that MDS
tag and you'll have the same DCA
approved certificate it's all about how
you think and how you approach towards
the society and towards your life is
more important rather than the number
what you have on the day of result it's
just a radius of action I hope you
remember the radius of action your
period the radius of action will be for
only for a particular duration of time
maybe one month two months three months
done it's done whether you're from GDC
whether you're from Brevard colors
whether you're from deemed and then all
same ok so don't get disheartened ok
it's all like tough game you need to
give a tough computation if you're not
if you feel you are bad at this position
take it as a challenge and take a move
and try to show you what you are to the
world so that's what I say that's what I
follow that's what I do and that's what
I have prune it ok I'm not from eg DC ok
I'm not afraid I'm not cheat I'm not a
GDC either from the UC or is it from the
PC
but I feel I am successful compared to
many other many of my friends who are a
part of Genesis many of my friends more
than 10 to 15 of my friends who are very
close to me are from Genesis but I make
dentistry better rather than the 10 or
15 people so this is what's additional
can give failure if you feel if you are
a failure if you feel you are not happy
with the rank if you feel you're feeling
bad right now yesterday with the result
okay
it is only until you are successful if
you go to greater lengths next year if
you got a great rank in the upcoming
games or upcoming need or upcoming PGA
or upcoming jipner you are called as
successful individual you have no more
called as a failure okay so what am I
saying at the last is success if you
have success now you need to get updated
in your success if you are failure now
you need to convert your failure into
success so it's always a dynamic process
it's not a static one so don't be on the
negative attitude okay feeling bad
feeling depressed it's always the
positive energy what we have learned in
MDS conquer that is more important
rather than the number that you have on
the day of Thrissur
your attitude towards the universe your
attitude towards the society and your
attitude towards the dentistry to you

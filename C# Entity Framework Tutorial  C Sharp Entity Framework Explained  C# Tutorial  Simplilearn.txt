hey everyone i am bravo kandaval and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel today we will talk about c-sharp
entity framework but first let me remind
you that we have daily updates on
numerous technologies so if you are a
tech geek looking for the latest
technological innovation then try
subscribing to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit the bell icon so you
will never miss an update on semteron's
youtube channel
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin our session with a
discussion on what is an entity
framework
then we will have a brief discussion
on the need for an entity framework
following that we will try to explain
various features of entity framework
then we will have a discussion on entity
framework architecture
where we will be defining the entity
data model
finally we will try to implement the
entity framework in the visual studio
now
let's start with what is entity
framework
an integrity framework is a free and
open source object relational mapper
that is orm that allows dotnet
developers to interact with databases
using dotnet objects
it allows developers to deal with data
using domain specific objects rather
than the underlying
database tables and columns where the
data is kept
when working with data developers may
work at a higher level of abstraction
with the entity framework allowing them
to construct and manage data oriented
systems with less code than a
traditional program
it also eliminates the requirement for
most data access layers
that developers typically have to write
now after understanding c sharp entity
framework let's discuss what is the need
for an entity framework
first an orm is an entity framework and
the goal for the orm is to boost
developers efficiency by minimizing the
number of duplicate tasks in the program
next
if you are inquiring
we may use link to entity to specify our
queries against the domain of the object
then entity framework will run the
required query in the database and then
materialize the results into domain
object instances per use with the app
at last we have entity framework that
can construct and execute the
appropriate database commands for
reading or writing data in the database
now let's go over the features
of c sharp entity framework
first we have cross platform
an entity framework core is a cross
platform framework that may be used on
windows linux and mac
next we have modeling
an entity framework generates an edm
that is entity data model based on plain
old clr object entities with get set
data types attribute
it employs the paradigm of querying and
saving entity data to the underlying
database
after that we have query
an entirely data framework
enables us to get data from the database
using link queries these link queries
will be translated by the database
provider into the database specific
query language that is
sql for the relational database
an entity framework also enables us to
run row sql queries on the database
then we have change tracking
an entity framework maintains track of
changes to instances of entities
property values that must be published
to the database
then we have
saving
when we call sync changes function an
entity framework performs the insert
update and delete commands to the
database based on the changes that
occurred to the entities
the asynchronous save changes async
function
is also available in an entity framework
after that we got concurrency
entity framework by default employs
optimistic concurrency to prevent
another user from overwriting
modifications
made when data is retrieved from the
database
next we have transaction
an entity framework streamlines
transaction management when requesting
or storing a data
it also allows you to personalize the
transaction management
after that we have caching
an entity framework comes with first
level of caching
by default as a result repeated queries
will return data from the cache rather
than the database
then we have built-in conventions an
entity framework adheres to the
standards of configuration programming
pattern and contains a set of default
rules that set up the entity framework
model automatically
next we have configuration an entity
framework allows us to configure the
entity framework model by overriding the
default conventions with the data
annotation property or the fluent api
at last we have migration
to establish or manage the database
schema entity framework provides a set
of migration commands that can be
invoked on the enugate package manager
console or the command line interface
next let's discuss the entity framework
architecture
now let's go over the entity data model
we have conceptual model we have storage
model
and mapping
let's discuss them one by one
first up conceptual model
the model cases and their connections
are represented in the conceptual model
the database design table has no bearing
on the conceptual model
next we have storage model
the database design model
contains the storage model which can
include
tables views store procedures
their associations and keys
at last we have mapping
mapping the information describes how
the conceptual model is transferred to
the storage model
next
let's try to implement this individual
studio
now let's try to create a new project
we will use
asp.net web application
we will click on next
then we will name this
as
simply
learn
ef
then we will click on create
make sure you are using dotnet framework
4.7.2 and we will click empty
and create
we'll wait for it to create the project
now
we will
right click
on this and click on manage and you get
packages
we will go to browse
and search
entity
framework
work
and we will take this first one this
entity framework
we will install
the 5.0.0 version
so click on
install you click on ok
and i accept
and it is installed
now let's close this
now let's connect to a database
so for the server we will use
local db
then we will have
ms sql
local
tv
and for the database name
you will have
simply
learn
ef
db
and we'll click on okay
we will wait for it to make the
connection to the database
it is asking us
to
create it because it does not exist or
maybe it exists but we don't have
permission to say it so let's create our
own
just click on yes
let's open it here we have table let's
try to expand but there are none
so right click on it
and
we will have a new query
let's write the query
so first we will go and write create
table
departments
first one we will have an id
and in parameter
which is also primary key so we will
have primary key
here
and we will give it identity as
attribute
then we will click comma
then we will have nam
and
for its
data type we will use anywhere care
of size 50
then we will also have a location
this will also be
an n where
care
of location
of size 50.
next we will also create a table called
student
student
this will also have
an id as a primary key so let's copy
some of this
since we will be using the same kind of
things so we will have id
we can have
the first name
ctrl c
ctrl v then we can have
last name
make sure to add table here i forgot to
add it
that's right it was giving us those red
lines
then we can have a gender
this will also be an n where
50
then we will have a fees
and
then we will have a foreign key that
will be a department
id
this will be an end
and
a foreign
key
which references
departments
id
now let's try to insert details in these
queries i've already prepared some of
these details let's cop let me copy them
and here
we have our queries
let's go over them
[Music]
one by one
so first we are inserting into
departments a value of engineer
and a location of block b as you can see
we have
we have already named these two
properties this id will be automatically
assigned
and if you look closely since we only
have three so it will go from one two
and three
now we have entries for the student
table
so now we will have first name
last name
gender the fees
and which department id it is given
so
for one we have this
engineering for three we have
love oh sorry commerce then
for
two
we have law
so let's run these
and as you can see one row was affected
one row that means it has created the
two tables
so let's refresh that and here you can
see two tables
so show data
we have this
for student show data
and we have these
let's close them
and
once build this solution
now we will right click here
and add
a new item
we will go to data
and select ado.net entity data model
we will name this one
as
student
model
then we will click add we will select
the first option from database
we will click next
our database is already created because
we have already created so it is already
selected here otherwise you can
come here again and select on this new
connection
then we have we will we need to click on
yes
to save the connection settings in
web.config
let's change this
we will have it as
student
tv
context
then we will click next
we are using entity framework 5.0
so we will select this and click next
here
we can expand on to this and we will
select both of these
then for the model
namespace
we can have something as simple as
student
model
then we'll click on finish
it will take some time to create it and
here we have
it is created
and this is
a student model this is what we call an
entity
data model
our entity is department
then in properties we have different
things as id name and location then in
navigation properties we have
a student which is also called mapping
of some sort
these properties are what we have as a
storage models
now
let's try to create a platform so we
will right click here
we will click on add a new item
we will go to web and select web form
we can leave the name as is we'll click
on next
let's close these references to make our
lives easier
now this is our
form
let's go ahead
and
go to view and open
our toolbox
here's our toolbox
we will add something called grid view
that's right it is the decision part
and we also need
an npt
data source
let's add this one also here
now
we will click on this design button
first let's build it
now we will go to design button
now
we will right click on entry data source
and click on show smart tag
we can either do that or we can just
simply click on this button
we will go to configure data source
we will choose student db contacts
default container as student db contacts
click on next
then we will select department
use this and then finish
then we will have this
and we click on auto format
we can choose any of these colors
i will go for the professional
and click ok
next we will choose our data source
and here we will click on
add new column select template field
and add it
for the header text we will name it
students
then click on ok
now we will add a template
and we will add something called
grid view
now we will click on edit bindings
we will go to customize bindings
we will write it as eval
and we will
put it as do that
and we will click ok
now we will go to this
and we will end
template editing
now what we will do is we will right
click on this and go to properties
let me change the camera position
and here
if you go down here
then we have include
here we will put it as students
will save it
now let's try and run it
it is opening on chrome
and here as you can see we have
each department by name then we have
location then we have a student tab
which will have
the different entries according to
the work
now let's close this and get back to our
slides

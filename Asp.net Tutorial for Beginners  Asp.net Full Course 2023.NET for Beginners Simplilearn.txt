foreign
work was founded by Microsoft and
introduced to programming World in
January of 2002. it is used by numerous
custom software development companies
globally still regarded as one of the
go-to Frameworks for the purpose of web
development asp.net is still widely
regarded as one of the most prominent
languages in the web development space
according to a report around 12 902
companies reportedly use asp.net in
their Tech Stacks including slacked
Alibaba travels and Roblox with around
one or three thousand dollars as average
salary for mid-level Professionals in
this field learning asp.net can be the
right career choice for you with that

quickly jump onto the agenda for this
session we will start by knowing the
basics of asp.net and difference between
dotnet and Java understanding asp.net
lifecycles MVC asp.net architecture by
the end of this video we'll cover a few
projects on asp.net followed by
interview questions so without any
further Ado let's begin over to our
tutors
Java is a programming language and
Computing platform there are lots of
applications and websites that will not
work unless you have Java installed in
it
Java was first released by Sun
Microsystems in 1995 and the Oracle
Corporation later acquired it Java
software platform runs on the billions
of devices including notebook computers
mobiles devices gaming consoles medical
devices and many others
Java is widely used object oriented
programming language the rules and
syntax of java are based on the C and C
plus plus languages
Java is fast secure and reliable from
laptops to Data Centers game consoles to
Scientific supercomputers cell phones to
the internet Java is everywhere
Java is a multi-platform object oriented
and network-centric language it is among
the most used programming language
now let us understand what is.net
.net is a free cross-platform open
source developer framework for building
many different types of applications
.net core is a cross-platform that
supports Windows Linux and Mac OS
Microsoft began developing.net framework
in the late 1990s by early 2000 the
first beta version of dotnet 1.0 were
released
with.net you can use multiple languages
editors libraries to build web mobile
desktop games and iot applications
we can write.net apps in c-sharp F-sharp
or Visual Basic whether you're working
in C sharp F sharp or Visual Basic the
code will run natively on any compatible
OS
dot net standard is a base set of apis
that are common to all.net
implementations
nugget is a package manager built
specifically for dotnet that contains
over 90 000 packages
now let us look at the comparison
between Java and dotnet
the first parameter is the fundamentals
Java is a programming language and
Computing platform that was first
released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
Java is widely used object oriented
programming language and software
platform that runs on billions of
devices including computers mobiles
medical devices and many others
whereas.net framework is free
cross-platform open source framework for
building different applications
by early 2000 the first beta version
of.net 1.0 was released
the next parameter is languages
Java itself is a programming language
however Java virtual machine supports
other programming languages like python
R and Ruby
with.net we can use multiple languages
we can write.net apps in C sharp F sharp
and Visual Basic
operating system
Java can work on different operating
systems like Microsoft Windows the
Solaris operating system Linux or Mac OS
whereas.net Works only on Windows
operating system that is Windows 98 or
later Windows NT 4.0 or later
integrated development environment
Java uses Ides like Eclipse bluej
IntelliJ IDEA J grasp J Creator netbeans
green foot and J developer
and in.net IDs like Autumn bracket
Sublime Text ikmas and Vim are used but
the most common one is Visual Studio
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
the next parameter is libraries
the Java class library is set of
dynamically loaded libraries the Java
virtual machine languages can call at
runtime
a Java library is just a collection of
classes that have been written by
somebody else
some of the library is used in Java are
Apache Commons Google guava and Jackson
whereas in.net framework class library
is the collection of classes namespaces
interfaces and value types that are used
for dotnet applications
class libraries are shared Library
concept for dotnet some of the.net
libraries are swashbuckle poly Auto
mapper and SAS kit
performance
Java's efficiency is from just in time
compiler and concurrency capabilities
the just in time compiler is a part of
the Java runtime environment
the compile code is immediately called
by Java virtual machine compiling does
not require processing time or memory
use because the code is not interpreted
as a result Java program is as quick as
native application
whereas
in.net.net users natively compiled
languages like C sharp and C plus plus
they are faster and less memory
consuming than
java.net also enables optimizing the
code and writing less code which
increases the performance
the shorter the code also means less
effort spent on the court maintenance
and easier debugging
versions
in Java the first beta version was
released in 1995. following which the
version 1.0 was released in Jan 1996 and
so on
the most recent versions was Java sc16
released in March 2021
and five months later Java SC 17 was
released on September 2021 and it's
likely that on March 2022 Java sc88 will
be released
in.net the first version 1.0 was
released on 15 Jan 2002.
and the most recent version released is
version 4.8 on 18th April 2019.
now let us look at the licensing of java
and dotnet
since the Java 8 update on April 16 2019
all versions and update for Java above 8
has no cost for personal use and
development purposes
but any other use needs a commercial
license
whereas in.net.net is free open source
developer platform with no licensing
cost and free development tools for
Linux Mac OS and windows there are no
licensing costs including commercial use
lastly we will look at jobs and salaries
there are over 3 lakh 16
715 Java developers currently employed
in United States
whereas in.net there are over 2 lakh
54189.net developers currently employed
in United States
the average salary for a Java developer
in India is 4 lakh 61 000.
whereas the average salary for a.net
developer in India is 4 lakh 14 000.
the average salary for Java developer in
United States is 76 000 dollars
whereas the average salary for a.net
developer in United States is 72 000
dollars
now let us see when to use Java and
dotnet
Java is suitable for Web projects big
data and GUI applications
Java is used as server side language for
backend development
Java is also used for embedded systems
Android applications and web
applications
because Java is portable you may choose
which operating system you want to work
on this adaptability allows to select
tools without having to worry about
compatibility difficulties
dotnet is used to build for web mobile
desktop games and iot .net is also used
for web applications client applications
and Enterprise development
dotnet has taken over for web services
and eapis
it is mostly preferred for Windows aapi
service let's first see why do we use
asp.net
many questions arise in our mind while
building an application
all we think about is speed cost and
language
but with respect to building a web
application asp.net is much easier as
compared to other Technologies like PHP
and node.js
it is much faster and much more
efficient than many other languages
asp.net also allows you to build many
types of applications like rest apis and
web pages
asp.net takes comparatively less time to
execute and the execution takes place
only once now when you have an idea
about why we use asp.net let us
understand what exactly asp.net is all
about
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing Dynamic web applications
asp.net was developed by Microsoft and
it is mainly used to build websites and
web applications
asp.net is the latest version of active
server Pages which Microsoft developed
to build websites it was released in
2002 and had an extension of Dot aspx
active server pages is a server-side
scripting language an engine used for
developing web applications
asp.net produces interactive data-driven
web applications on the internet
now when we know what is asp.net let's
have a look at the architecture and
components of asp.net
first let's have a look at the
architecture and then we shall focus on
the components
asp.net architecture helps in increasing
performance scalability and flexibility
first asp.net requests an HTML file from
the server then internet Information
Services or IIs passes that information
to the asp.net engine and after that
asp.net engine reads the file and
executes the script IIs or Internet
Information Services is an extensible
web server used to host asp.net web
applications
after that asp.net Returns the file to
the browser as an HTML file
now when we know the architecture of
asp.net it is time to move on to the
components of asp.net
asp.net architecture depends on three
different components the three
components are language library and
Common Language runtime let's have a
look at these three components in detail
the first component we have is language
when we build an application we need to
code the application so that we can
communicate with the computer
there are many computer languages that
help to communicate with computers to
develop web applications some of them
are vb.net and c-sharp which are
typically used to build applications in
asp.net
the second component we have is the
library
library is a pre-written class or a
coded template that a developer can use
while developing an application
the most common Library used for asp.net
web applications is the web Library
web library is a part of a website that
offers a stock of websites when users
browse
the third and the last component we have
is the common language runtime common
language runtime is a platform used to
execute the programs it is also used for
performing Key activities like garbage
collection
moving forward let's understand some
basic skills that are required to master
asp.net
some of the basic skills that are
required to understand asp.net are
first you should have some basic
knowledge of C sharp JavaScript and HTML
then you should have some knowledge
about asp.net MVC along with this we
must have good knowledge of object
oriented programming Concepts and some
experience in web development
moving forward let's understand the
tools and Frameworks used for asp.net
the first tool we have is the Microsoft
web platform installer Microsoft web
platform installer is a free tool that
can help run web applications and get
the latest SQL Server Express
the second tool we have is SQL complete
SQL complete is a customizable tool that
improves the quality of the code and
simplifies the creation of SQL queries
with context based code completion
moving forth the next tool is web
Essentials for visual studio web
Essentials for visual studio is a tool
that opens up the inventory of CSS HTML
JavaScript and typescript the fourth
tool on our list is the resharper
resharper is the tool that provides an
absolute productivity boost in code
quality analysis and reduces Time by
identifying errors which makes
developers build applications quickly
now when we know about the tools and
Frameworks of asp.net let's have a look
at some of the benefits of using asp.net
first the applications developed using
asp.net perform better than the
applications developed using other
Technologies like PHP and node.js
then asp.net provides more security to
the application so that you can easily
develop secure applications through the
built-in Windows authentication and
pre-application configuration features
asp.net also provides multiple
development modes for the applications
so that the applications are easy for
configuration and deployment
one of the best features of asp.net is
its language independent feature which
means we can use any language that we
are comfortable with hence the
applications built using asp.net can be
used across the globe
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing Dynamic web applications
it is the latest version of the active
server Pages active server pages is a
server-side scripting language and
engine used for developing web
applications it is essentially a
web-based platform that helps to create
Dynamic web pages for programmers
asp.net produces interactive data driven
web applications on the internet
it works on HTTP protocols and uses HTTP
commands to set communication between
the server and the browser
the codes can be written in many
different languages like c-sharp visual
studio and JavaScript
the latest version of asp.net is the
active server Pages which Microsoft
developed to build websites it was
released in 2002 and had an extension of
Dot aspx
asp.net consists of a large number of
controls such as text boxes buttons and
labels for assembly it reduces
interactive data-driven web applications
on the internet which helps to build
websites and web applications in a
better and colorful way
now when we know what is asp.net let's
have a look at the architecture of
asp.net
asp.net architecture consists of three
different components the first component
is language then comes library and
finally comes the common language
runtime
moving forward we should learn about
these three components one after the
another the first component we have is
language
whenever we build an application the
first task is to communicate with the
application which is made possible by
different programming languages
the three major languages that asp.net
uses to communicate with a computer are
C sharp vb.net and F sharp the second
component is the library library is a
pre-written class or a coded template
that a developer can use while
developing an application
the most common Library used for asp.net
web applications is the web Library
web library is a part of a website that
offers a collection of websites when
users browse
it possesses all the properties that
help in building a web application
the third and last integral component is
the common language runtime
common language runtime is a platform
used to execute the programs
common language runtime mainly helps to
execute.net programs and it is also used
for performing Key activities like
garbage collection and exception
handling
the code that the common language
runtime directly manages is called the
managed code
now when we know about the architecture
and its components let's have a look at
some of the characteristics of asp.net
here we shall see five characteristics
of asp.net beginning with code behind
model then we have directives followed
by caching and after caching we have
user controls and State Management
let's have a look at all these
characteristics one by one
beginning with the code behind model
characteristic
code behind model helps in dealing with
dynamic programming code it also helps
to place code in a separate designated
script or a specific file named as
mypage Dot aspx.cs
while the main page file is my page Dot
aspx
code behind model also helps to create
applications with different content the
second characteristic is directives
directives act like a support to the
pages it gives support by providing
special instructions to the developer on
how a page should be processed
directives also specify and enable the
attribute to show how an application
should be used
then comes the third characteristic and
that is caching
caching helps in improving the
performance of an application which
helps a user to use an application more
efficiently
it also helps to store Page requests of
the user in a temporary location
the fourth characteristic is user
controls
the sections of pages that are
registered and used as controls are
called as the user controls user
controls also create markup files that
contain static HTML markup and server
side web controls
the fifth and final characteristic is
the state management characteristic
asp.net provides State Management which
helps to store the state of every user
by providing the state of every user it
becomes easy to use asp.net applications
asp.net lifecycle is very crucial when
it comes to developing applications
the life cycle includes two different
stages that help in producing Dynamic
outputs these two stages together are
known as the asp.net lifecycle
the two stages in which the life cycle
is divided are application life cycle
and the page life cycle
now we shall have a look at both of
these types in detail
first let's have a look at the
application life cycle
application lifecycle is the part that
starts when the user makes a request
these requests involve several stages
and these stages are application start
object creation HTTP application dispose
and application end
let's have a look at each of these step
in detail the first step we have is
application start
whenever a user requests an application
for accessing a web server first the
request is checked and then the request
for accessing it is provided
the second stage we have is the object
creation object creation helps in
holding all the information about the
request cookies and browsing information
it also holds HTTP context HTTP request
and HTTP response by the browser the
third stage is the HTTP application
HTTP application holds back all the
subsequent information sent back to the
user by the web driver
for example if we have two different
applications like one is a gaming
application and the other one is a
social media application
then that means there will be two HTTP
applications that are to be created to
process the application
the fourth stage is dispose dispose
helps in erasing the unmanaged resources
when the objects are no longer needed
moving forth the last and the final
stage is the application end
application end helps to unload the
memory of an application here unloading
memory means cleaning up The Unwanted
files in the application
now when we know about the application
life cycle let's have a look at the page
lifecycle
page lifecycle includes initialization
restoring and execution
when an asp.net page is called it goes
through some phases before the response
is sent to the user
let's have a look at the phases involved
in the page life cycle beginning with
page request
then comes page start page
initialization page load validation
event handling rendering and unload
let's have a look at all these steps in
detail
the first phase of the page life cycle
is Page request
when the user requests a page the server
checks the request compiles the page and
responds to the user
if the page is requested several times
then the cache will check the request to
see if the output exists or not and
after that it will send a response back
to the user the second phase is paid
start
pH start holds two objects request and
response the request holds all the
information which was sent when the page
was requested and the response holds all
the information sent back to the user
the third phase is the page
initialization phase during the page
initialization phase all controls are
initialized and each controller is
provided with a specific ID
in the page initialization phase themes
are also applied to the applications
the fourth phase is Page load
in this phase the application is
provided with some control properties
and the information is also set using
view State and control State the fifth
phase of the page life cycle is
validation
when a page is executed the result of
those pages are provided in the form of
two conditions
true and false if the execution goes
successful the result is true while if
there is an error in execution it
returns false
the sixth phase in the life cycle is
event handling
this phase is the response to the
validation phase in this phase pages are
loaded again and display the same
information
in order to overcome this a postback
event is called this event helps in
checking the credentials of the user
the seventh phase of the life cycle is
the rendering it occurs when all the
response information has been sent back
to the user the phase also stores all
the information that is being sent
the eighth in the final stage of the
page life cycle is unload
unload helps to clean all The Unwanted
information of an application
it also cleans the memory once the
output is sent back to the user
what is a navigation bar in asp.net
navigation bar in asp.net is used to
create a navigation header for a website
or a web application
it makes it simple for an application to
browse
asp.net has three navigation controls
Dynamic menus tree views and sitemap
path
Dynamic menu displays the standard site
navigation menu
whereas tributes displays a multi-level
navigation menu
and sitemap part displays a trail to the
current page and link to the previous
page
now let us look at a demo on how to
create a navigation bar
so we have open Visual Studio 2019 go to
file
new
create a new project
will select asp.net core web app model
view controller template scroll down
so select this template
click on next
provide the project name
since we are creating a navigation bar
so we'll provide the project name as
nav bar
click on next
and if you want to change the target
framework you can change it here
I'll skip the default one
click on create
so here you can see the project is
successfully created
let's click on view and open solution
Explorer
so now let us run this and see what is
the output
here you can see the build has started
here you can see it is running on
localhost and
this is the default nav bar
which is created so what we'll do is
we'll go and change this navigation bar
so go back to visual studio
go to solution Explorer
go to views go to layout.cshtml
open this file
and here you can see
if you look look inside the header this
is the nav bar
so what we'll do is
we'll delete the snap bar
so this is the small code which I have
pasted here so I have created a class
nav bar and provided the background
color as dark and I haven't provided any
link as of now and I have named it as
simply learn
and similarly I have created another
class
in this class I've created a drop down
in this drop down I have named it as
courses articles and others
so let us go and run this
and see the output
so this is the nav bar which we created
they simply learn whom about and we
created a drop down
resources in this drop down we have
courses articles and others
similarly we have contact us and we have
this search bar
this one this is the navbar which we
created so we'll go back to the code
so here we have created
another class nav path contact us and
this is where we created the search bar
what is asp.net core
asp.net core is an open source
cross-platform high performance
framework for developing modern
cloud-enabled Internet connected apps
asp.net core is the open source version
of asp.net that runs on Mac OS Linux and
windows
asp.net core was first released in 2016
and is a redesign of earlier Windows
only versions of asp.net
why use asp.net core
asp.net is used by millions of
developers to construct web applications
esp.net core is a redesigned version of
asp.net that includes architectural
improvements to create a more modular
framework
with asp.net core we can build web apps
and services iot apps and mobile
backends
we can use development tools on Windows
Mac OS and Linux
using asp.net core we can deploy to the
cloud or on-premises
we can run on.net core now let us look
at the features of asp.net code
esp.net core provides a single framework
for developing web UI and web apis
asp.net core is designed for testing
it provides Razer pages that make it
easier and more productive to code page
Focus situations
laser allows use of C sharp alongside
JavaScript in the browser
share server side and client-side
application logicbuilt-in.net
asp.net core has the capability to
design and run applications on Windows
Mac OS and Linux
it is Community Driven and open source
it provides modern client-side
Frameworks and development methods that
are integrated
asp.net is a configuration system that
is cloud ready and environment based
it gives high performance lightweight
modular HTTP request Pipeline and
provides build in dependency injection
asp.net core has the capability to host
on the following platforms that is
Kestrel IIs HTTP nginx and Apache docker
now let us look at the architecture of
asp.net
the concept of asp.net fundamental
architecture is similar to n layer
architecture that defines the layer as
the core component of the platform
releasing the developer the burden of
redefining it in order to make solution
more flexible and reusable
the main business logic and UI logic in
asp.net core are encapsulated in the web
app layer while the database access
layer CAD services and web API services
are encapsulated in the infrastructure
layer common utilities objects
interfaces and reusable business
services are encapsulated as micro
services in the application core project
the data sources could be SQL database
and the third party Services include
GitHub API sendgrid API and others
dotted Arrow shows the compile time
dependency and the regular Arrow
indicates a runtime dependency
application core project
the business model which contains
entities services and interfaces
restored in the application code
these interfaces contains abstractions
for operations done by infrastructure
such as database access file system
access and network calls and so on
application code types include entities
interfaces services and DDOS
infrastructure project
the infrastructure project includes data
access implementations such as Entity
framework EF core migration objects and
data access implementation classes
the infrastructure project contains
implementation of services that must
interact with the infrastructure
concerns
these Services Implement interfaces
defined in the application code and so
infrastructure should have a reference
to the application core project
infrastructure types include AF core
types data access implementation types
and infrastructure specific services
benefits of asp.net core over asp.net
framework
benefits of dotnet core over dot NET
Framework include it provides
cross-platform it runs on Windows Mac OS
and Linux
asp.net core has improved performance
it provides side-by-side versioning
it provides new apis and it is open
source
now let us look at the industry trends
of asp.net core
this picture depicts the industry trends
of asp.net and Net Framework
asp.net core is the most used framework
and it is growing in popularity as the
majority of developers use it on regular
basis
it is expected that asp.net will
overtake.net framework in popularity in
coming years
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so now let us look at the demo
so we'll first look at the prerequis
sites
first we need to install the required
software and set up the system for
asp.net core development first we need
the editor maybe Visual Studio Sublime
Autumn or any other but I would
recommend to go with Visual Studio 2019
next we need dotnet core SDK software
development kit so let's go to the
browser and install this
so go to the visual
studio.microsoft.com and go to downloads
from here you can download visual studio
2019
the Community Edition this is free any
Community Edition then to download.net
SDK
go to dotnet microsoft.com from here you
can download.net core
from here you can download dotnet Core
3.1
so click on this side get this download
once you have downloaded these files
open Visual Studio code open Visual
Studio 29.
so open Visual Studio 2019 when you open
it for the first time in the workloads
under the tool set section select.net
core cross platform
on the left hand side it shows a recent
project that you have worked on
and at the right hand side we can create
a new project we can open a folder open
a project or a solution and clone a
reposited
so we'll click on create new project
so these are the different project
templates
present in Visual Studio 2019
we have asp.net core web app this is
used for creating core application for
example laser Pages content and we have
Laser Web assembly and then we have
esp.net core MD in this template we can
create dotnet core application from the
scratch then we have asp.net core web
app model V controller we'll discuss
this in the upcoming videos similarly we
have laser server app usb.net core web
API and many more
then scroll down and explore we have
many more we have asp.net core with
angular with react.js
so for now we'll use asp.net core Mt
so select this asp.net core Mt and click
on next
and name the project so we'll name the
project as
demo application
if you want to provide a different
solution name you can check this box and
provide a different solution name
so click on next
select the target framework
dot net core 3.1 or 5.0 I'll select it
as 5.0
and click on next
click on create
okay so here we go the demo app project
is created
these are the default folders that I've
generated you have dependencies folder
in which we have analyzers and
Frameworks and we have properties folder
in which we have launch setting.json
file
then we have app settings.json file and
we have program and startup file so
we'll run this
and see click on run
and here you can see build started
here we can see
the localhost
44313
so it's showing hello world so where is
this hello infecting generator from
so go back to visual studio
so go to solution Explorer
and go to startup.cs file
if you scroll down
you can see here
this is where hello world is getting
generated from
so we'll change this
change the message and enter
so change the message and enter thanks
for watching stay tuned
so let me run this
and here you see
so here you can see thanks for watching
and stay tuned
what is MVC pattern
the model view controller MVC
architectural pattern divides an
application into three major component
groups model view and controller
the principle behind developing MVC is
the separation of concerns this
principle implies that software should
be classified based on the type of task
it performs
separation ensures that the business
model is simple to test and can change
without becoming too involved in
low-level implementation details
using this MVC pattern user requests are
routed to a controller who is in charge
of interacting with the model to conduct
user actions and receive query results
the controller selects the view to be
displayed to the user and supplies it
with any model data it requires
what is asp.net core MVC
the asp.net core MVC framework is a
lightweight open source and highly
testable presentation framework designed
specifically for use with asp.net core
asp.net core MVC is an application
framework that allows you to create
modern web apps by using the MVC model
view controller architectural pattern
asp.net core MVC provides a pattern
based approach to developing Dynamic
websites that allow for a clear
separation of concerns
it allows you to complete markup control
facilitates tdd friendly development and
corresponds to the most recent web
standards
functions of MVC
let's look at the model functions the
responsibilities that a model carries
in an MVC application the model
represents the applications State and
any other business logic or activities
that should be executed by it
business logic and any implementation
Logic for maintaining the application
State should be wrapped in the model
view model classes intend to contain the
data to display on that view are often
used in strong typed views
the model is used by the controller to
construct and populate this view model
instances
view responsibilities
views are in charge of displaying
content through the user interface
day embed.net code in HTML markup using
the Razer view engine
view should have minimal logic and any
logic should be related to presenting
content
consider using a view component view
model or view template to simplify the
view if you need to perform a logic in
View files to display data from a
complex model
now let us look at the functions of a
controller
controllers are the components that
manage user input interact with the
model and finally choose which view to
render
the view just displays information in an
MVC application the controller processes
and responds to the user input and
interaction
the controller is the initial entry
point in the MVC architecture and it is
responsible for deciding which model
type to interact with and which view to
represent hence its name is controller
as it responds to a given request
now let us look at the components of
asp.net MVC
some of the components of mvcr routing
model binding model validation
dependency injection filters and areas
now let us look at them one by one
at first we have routing
asp.net core MVC is built on top of
asp.net core routing a robust URL
mapping component that enables the
creation of applications with logical
and searchable urls
this allows us to establish URL naming
patterns for applications that perform
well for search engine optimization and
Link generation regardless of how the
files on your web server are arranged
routes can be defined with a simple
route template syntax that takes into
account route value limitations defaults
and optional values
next we have model binding
model binding in asp.net core MPC
transforms client request such as form
values route data query string
parameters and HTTP headers it transform
this data into objects that the
controller can handle
as a result the controller logic does
not have to do the job of determining
the incoming request data instead the
data is passed as parameters to its
action methods
next we have model validation
validation is supported in asp.net core
MVC by decorating your model object with
data annotation validation attributes
before values are sent to the server the
validation attributes are checked on the
client side the framework validates
request data on both the client and the
server side
dependency injection
asp.net core includes dependency
injection capabilities
controllers in asp.net core MVC can
request required Services through their
Constructors allowing them to follow to
the explicit dependencies principle
dependency injection is the software
design technique that achieves inversion
of control between classes and the
dependencies
does
filters in asp.net core enable code to
be executed before or after particular
stages of the request processing
pipeline
filters can be used as attributes on
controllers or actions
filters manage duties such as
authorization restricting unauthorized
access to the sources and response
catching
filters allow for the execution of
custom pre and post-processing Logic for
Action methods and they may be see to
run at certain points in the execution
pipeline for given request
last we have areas
areas allow you to divide a large
asp.net core MVC web app into smaller
functional groups
an area is an MVC structure that exists
between an application
logical components such as model
controller and view are kept in separate
folders in an MVC project and MVC uses
naming conventions to build a
relationship between these components
it may be good to partition a large app
into different high-level functional
regions
for example consider an e-commerce app
with numerous business units such as
checkout billing and search among others
each of this unit has its own set of
logical component views controllers and
models
now let us look at the demo in this demo
we will create our first asp.net core
MVC application
so first we need to install the required
software and set up the system for
asp.net core MVC development firstly we
need dot net core SDK software
development kit then we need to install
jsql server and then we need to install
editor-like Visual Studio
once you have installed the visual
studio click on launch
Visual Studio 2019 is getting opened
so this is how the visual studio 2019
looks like towards the left hand side we
have the recent applications which we
have worked on and towards the right
side we have the options to clone a
repository to open a project or a
solution to open a local folder or
create a new project so click on create
a new project
here we have different project templates
we have console application which is
used for creating a command line
application that can run on.net core
Windows Linux and Mac OS
similarly we have other templates like
asp.net core web app Blazer web assembly
app and if you scroll down you have many
more templates
but for this project we need the
template asp.net core web app model view
controller since this project this video
is related to MVC we need this template
so select this template this template
basically is used for creating an
asp.net core application
with asp.net core MVC model view and
controller
so select this click on next
if the project name
so we'll enter it as a demo since we are
showing a demo so we'll enter the
project name demo if you want the
solution name to be different from the
project name then check this box and
provide the solution name
so we'll keep it as it is
click on next
select the target framework
authentication type if required then
click on create
here you go the project is successfully
created
so here you can see there are different
types of files and folders
for this template the addition of
folders is the controller model and view
so these three folders are added for
this particular template MVC
you can check out our previous video on
esp.net code tutorial wherein I have
explained each of these folders in
detail
shared you can see
layout.cs.html open this file
so let's click on run and see what is
the output
click on run here you can see build
started
here you can see it is running on the
Local Host server
so this is the project this is the
template
let us go back to the visual studio and
change this so this is where
you can change the title from demo
will change it to Simply learn
similarly if you want to change
the home or the Privacy you can change
it here
this is where you modify all the setup
so we'll reset and click on run restart
so here you can see the demo is changed
to simply done so this is how we get
started with MVC application from here
you can modify all this go back to the
visual studio and modify if you click on
home this will come back to the same
homepage click on privacy
it shows this page
so this was about the template model
view controller
what are web apis
the asp.net web API is a framework for
creating HTTP Based Services that can be
used in a variety of applications on a
variety of platforms such as web games
windows and mobile
on the dotnet framework asp.net web API
is an excellent foundation for
developing restful labs
some of the examples of web API are
Microsoft graph Microsoft graph is a
collection of apis that gives us
information back out of our Microsoft
account
Azure devops Azure devops we can get
information about devops pipeline using
the Azure devops API
cognitive Services we can use cognitive
Services if we are interested in adding
machine learning
playfab playfab is a set of apis for
games
features of web apis
the asp.net web API platform is suitable
for creating restful services
the asp.net web API is based on asp.net
and uses asp.net request response
pipeline
HTTP hypertext transfer protocol works
are mapped to Method names in the
asp.net web API
web API can be hosted on IIs or any
other web server that supports dotnet
version 4.0 and more
asp.net web API supports different data
types like dot Json XML and many other
formats that are supported natively
to interface with web API server the
asp.net web API framework contains a new
HTTP client HTTP client can be used in
asp.net and MVC server-side applications
now let us look at the demo
in this demo we will create a web API
project
first let's go to visual studio
launch the visual studio
create a new project
scroll down and search for asp.net core
web API this project template is used
for creating an asp.net core application
with an example controller for a restful
HTTP service
so select this template and click on
next
provide the project name
since we are showing a demo I'll name it
as demo web API
click on next click on create
foreign
so here you can see the project is
successfully created
on the right hand side if you can see we
have startup and program.cs file
if you notice here in controllers we
have weather forecast controller.cs open
this
in this we have a single get method this
method receives request for weather data
and returns some response
if we also notice here we have weather
forecast.cs
open this
in this we have the class weather
forecast the function of this class is
to form the structure of information
that we want to return from our API
so let's go ahead and run this
click on this green arrow Mark and run
the build has started
it's running on the Local Host
this is the output it shows the date and
the temperature in Celsius and the
temperature in Fahrenheit and this
summary
so in this video we are going to create
a login application
which has the username password and a
login button
so before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
click down the Bell icon so you never
miss an update from Simply learn
watch the video till the end so that you
don't miss on the demo so without
wasting any further time let's get
started
so let's go to visual studio
after opening Visual Studio
on the left hand side you have all the
recent applications which you have
opened and on the right hand side you
have the options to clone a repository
which means you can get a code from an
online repository like GitHub or Azure
devops or you can open an existing
project or a solution
or you can open a local folder or create
a new project so we'll create a new
project
once you create a new project here you
can select the template
so we'll search for the asp.net web
application template
so in the search for template search box
type asp.net web application
so here you can see we have two asp.net
web
application.net framework templates
the difference between these two is this
template uses Visual Basic and this
template uses C sharp
so we will select the template which
uses C sharp
this template is basically used for
creating asp.web application where forms
MVC or web API applications
so select this template and click on
next
and provide a suitable project name
since we are creating a sign in page I
have entered the project name as sign in
Project similarly if you want to change
the location you can change the location
and provide the solution name
and select the framework version which
you want
so I'll keep the default framework
latest one in my system is 4.7.2
so click on create
so here we need to select uh
template whether we want empty web forms
MVC web API or single page application
empty it is basically a template which
does not have any content in it and web
forms waveform is a template for
creating web form applications it is
used to build Dynamic websites using the
familiar drag and drop functionality it
is it has the event driven model
similarly if we look at MVC this
template allows to build applications
using the model V controller
architecture so model view controller
has the features that enable fast test
driven development for creating
applications that use the latest
standard then we have web API web API is
used for creating restful HTTP services
that can reach a broad range of clients
including browsers and mobile devices
and we have single page application this
template is basically used to create
client-side JavaScript driven HTML5
application using asp.net web API so for
this project we will select MVC
and we'll
not change any Authentication
and
keep all the settings as it is and click
on create
so here we go we have successfully
created the project so if you look at
the right hand side in the solution
Explorer we have a list of folders
so we have the root folder this is the
root folder so the default root folder
is used for storing the static files
related to the project and those files
can be accessed programmatically with
the relative path and we have the
controller folder so this controller
folder
contains controller classes where the
operation related code is written
the model folder contains the domain or
entity classes models can be written
anywhere in the solution such as in
separate class library or folder Etc
similarly we have views folder so the
views folder holds the Eraser Pages
which are responsible for showing and
getting the data from the user
similarly in the folders We will have an
app setting.json file this folder
contains the configuration and secret
details of the application and we will
have the program.cs file the program.cs
file is the starting point of the
application which will create the host
for an application to run the
application and we will have the
startup.cs file so this startup.cs file
allows to configure the behavior of the
application such as defining the roots
and dependency injection
so we'll get started with this
so we'll run the application and see the
default output
so the build has started
so this is the default output here we
have application name
whom
home page about and contact so what
we'll do is we'll create a login page
that is assignment page here
so we'll go back to visual studio
go to solution Explorer
right click on the controller folder add
a controller
select MVC controller empty
and click on ADD
and name the controller so we will keep
it as default controller
and click on that
let's go to models right click click on
ADD
and add a class
select the class
and click on ADD
here you can see a class is created
so what we'll do is we'll rename this
class
right click rename and we'll rename this
as user controller class
once the class is renamed go inside this
public class
and write a code
type prop and double tap
so the first property will be of the
type integer and it will be
a number
ID number
similarly
second property
crop and double tap will be of the type
string
and this will be username
similarly third
so after writing this code go back to
the default controller
here
go to the action result index page right
click
and click on ADD View
here you can see it contains mvc5 View
select this and click on ADD
and provide the index name
so I'll keep it as it is
and select the template
in the template it has create delete
details edit empty list all these
templates but we'll select the create
template and select the model class
select the user controller this was the
model class which we created
user controller
so select user controller and in the
options select create as partial View
then click on ADD
here you can see this page is created
so we'll run this page and see the
output
so here you can see
this is the signing page which we
created we have the number username and
password
so what we'll do we'll make some changes
we'll change this create button to sign
in button and we'll change this user
controller
so we'll go back to the visual studio
and here you can see we have user
controller
we'll change it to
sign in page
foreign
[Music]
and we'll change the create button to
sign in button
so we'll save this
and click on run
so here you can see this is changed to
sign in page and the button is changed
to sign
so you can enter the any value here
number
and enter the username password and
click on sign
what is a web API
the asp.net web API framework is used to
create HTTP services that may be
accessed by a variety of clients
including browsers mobile phones and
tablets asp.net web API is the extension
of WCF rest API
in a nutshell it's a replacement for the
WCF rest API it's compatible with
asp.net MVC and other web applications
such as asp.net web forms asp.net web
API is an excellent foundation for
developing restful Labs so what is this
WCF rest API
WCF stands for Windows communication
Foundation is a communication framework
that may be used to create web services
in.net it is secure dependable and
scalable it offers an uniform
programming model for service oriented
application development
asp.net is quite similar to asp.net MVC
because of its MVC capabilities like
routing controllers action results
filters model binders ioc container and
dependency injection
asp.net web API is an excellent
foundation for developing restful apps
restful apps that is their
representational state transfer is an
architecture Paradigm that follows the
concepts of rest architecture principles
the concept of resources support the
rest architecture the concept of
resources that supports the rest
architecture may be the use of resources
to express an application State and
functionality over the HTTP protocol
this resources are identified using URLs
now let us look at the examples of web
API
the first one is router API
Twitter API allows you to show tweets on
your website using the Twitter API then
we have YouTube API this allows you to
embed videos from YouTube on your
website Facebook API allows to display
information from Facebook onto the
website similarly we have Microsoft
graph Microsoft graph is a collection of
apis that give us information back out
of our Microsoft account next we have
Azure devops using Azure devops we can
get information about devops pipeline
using the Azure devops API
cognitive Services we can use cognitive
Services if we are interested in adding
machine learning
playfab playfab is a set of apis for
games
why use an web API
truly chooses a web-based application is
insufficient people use iPhones mobile
phones and tablets and other devices on
regular basis these smartphones also
come with a plethora of apps that makes
life easier in fact we are migrating
away from the web towards the realm of
app so if you want to expose your
service data to browsers and all of this
contemporary devices apps in a quick and
easy way you will need an API that's
compatible with both browser and devices
web API is an excellent foundation for
making your data and service available
to a wide range of devices web API is an
appropriate platform for developing
restful applications using the.net
framework because of its open source
unlike WCF rest API it uses all of the
HTTP features
and you don't have to declare any
additional configuration for different
devices
now let us look at some of the key
features of web API this of web API the
asp.net web API platform is suitable for
creating restful services
the asp.net web API is based on asp.net
and uses the asp.net request response
pipeline
HTTP verbs are mapped to Method names in
the asp.net web API IIs self-hosted or
any other web server that supports
dotnet 4.0 version or above can host
asp.net web API different data types are
supported by asp.net web API Json XML
and differentiation formats are all
supported natively to interface with the
web API server the asp.net web API
framework contains a new HTTP client
HTTP client can be used in asp.net MVC
server side applications window forms
applications console application and
other application
let us look at the different versions of
web API
the first web API version is 1.0 it is
supported by dotnet framework 4.0 and it
coincides with asp.net model view
controllers 4. the current version of
web API is version 2.0
it is supported by dotnet framework 4.5
and coincides with asp.net mvc5
let's see the difference between asp.net
web API and asp.net MVC
asp.net web API is used to create fully
fledged HTTP service that can only
return data and not views
whereas asp.net MVC is used to construct
online applications that return both
views and data web API allows to create
restful services using the.net framework
and it also enables content negotiation
and self-hosting
whereas in asp.net MVC it doesn't
support this
web API returns data in specific format
such as Json XML or any other
whereas MVC only returns data in Json
format in web API the request is
translated to actions based on HTTP
verbs in web API
whereas in MVC it is mapped to action
names similarly web API is lightweight
design that may be used with smartphone
apps in addition to web applications
when we have a controller that is both
MVC and web API and want to implement an
authorization we must construct two
filters one for MVC and one for web API
because they both are different
now let us look an introduction to http
the HTTP protocol can be used to access
a web API over the Internet its
framework for creating and developing
HTTP based restful Services hypertext
transfer protocol is a protocol for
retrieving resources such as HTML
documents it is the foundation of any
data interchange on the internet
and it is a client server protocol
meaning that the requests are started by
the recipient which is commonly the web
browser text layout descriptions photos
videos scripts and other subdocuments
are fetched and a complete document is
reconstructed for them
grid operations can be mapped to the
four primary HTTP methods that is get
put post and delete get fetches the
resources representation at a given URL
and put changes the state of resource at
a given URL post is used to create a new
resource and delete removes a resource
from a given URL
hypertext transfer protocol is a request
response protocol that communicates
between a client and a server a client
that is a browser sends an HTTP request
to the server which is then responded by
the server the answer may include the
requested content as well as the status
information about the request
so this is an example of HTTP request
the client submits a request to the
server via the HTTP protocol and the
server and the web browser respond to
the client based on the request
every HTTP request has three parts a
request line a request header and a
request body and the request body is
optional the request line defines a
method which instructs the server on how
to handle the data or resource
and the request header contains a
request URL which is used to locate the
requested resource to the server it also
defines which version of HTTP protocol
is being used this is an example of HTTP
response HTTP response is a server
response with the goal of providing the
client with the request resources
now let's have a look at the server's
response this is how the response header
status line looks like the HTTP protocol
version status code and reason phrase
are all included and this is known as
status line
and the response header one or more
response header lines can be present and
they are used to transmit additional
information from the server to the
client the response body contains a
resource that client has requested if
the request fails the response body
specifies the cost for the failure as
well as the steps and decline must do to
complete the request successfully let us
see how to set up the development
environment the prerequisite is we need
to have Visual Studio installed in our
device and dotnet software development
kit so let's jump into the browser and
see how to install this first of all we
need to install Visual Studio Microsoft
Visual Studio to install that go to
visual studio.microsoft.com
and in downloads
go to the downloads and here you can
install the community version which is
free
so Microsoft Visual Studio is an
integrated development environment from
Microsoft it is used to develop computer
programs as well as websites web apps
and web services and mobile apps then
after this we need to go to
dotnet.microsoft.com here you can
install the software development kit
with the latest version
scroll down select your operating system
and select the installer which you want
to install
then we need to install the SQL Server
management studio just go to the browser
and type download ssms and it will take
you to this website here scroll down
and you can click here to download free
download for SQL Server management
Studio
so after installing these three
softwares you are ready
for the demo now finally let us look at
the demo let's go to the visual studio
open Visual Studio code I have Visual
Studio 2019 installed in my device so on
the left hand side you can see the
recently opened projects on the right
hand side you have these options where
we can clone a repository include a
repository we can get code from an
online repository like GitHub or Azure
devops or we can open an existing
project or a solution
similarly we can open a local folder and
we can create a new project
so let's create a new project
here there are many templates you can
explore all the templates just scroll
down you have many number of templates
so for this project we will be using
asp.net web application.net framework so
basically we have two asp.net web
application.net framework One is using
Visual Basic and the other one is using
C sharp
so we'll select the one with the C sharp
asp.net web
application.net framework select this
and click on next
provide the project name
and
keep the default project name web
application 9 and you can change the
location if you want so I'll keep the
default location and if you want the
solution name you can change it and
select the latest framework so I have
the dot NET Framework 4.7.2 the recent
one so I'll keep it as it is and next
click on create
so here you have the following templates
so you need to select one among this
template so empty is a template where
the there is no content in it and web
forms waveforms in asp.net is the extend
the event driven interaction Concepts to
web application the browser sends a web
form to the web server which responds
with a full markup page or a HTML page
all users actions on the client are sent
to the server for stateful processing in
web forms or you can select MVC so MVC
basically it is a project template for
creating asp.net MVC applications model
view controller applications so it
allows us to build applications using
the model view controller architecture
and similarly we have web API web API is
a project template for creating restful
HTTP services and we have single page
application that is used for creating
Rich client-side JavaScript driven HTML5
applications and it is a single page
application so that provides a rich user
experience which includes client-side
interactions using HTML CSS and
JavaScript
so for this project we will select empty
and we will check these boxes MVC and
web API since we are using a web API
here
so we'll check these two boxes and
and keep the authentication as it is
with no authentication don't change it
and keep this options as it is and click
on create
so here we go we have successfully
created the project so
on the right hand side you can see the
solution Explorer so before we start
with the project I will explain you the
different folders that are present in
the solution Explorer so first of all we
will have the root folder so the root
folder is the default root folder for
storing the static files related to the
project and those files can be accessed
programmatically with relative path and
similarly we have controller folder the
controller folder contains the
controller classes where the operation
related code is written similarly we
have model folder model folder contains
the domain or entity classes models can
be written anywhere in the solution such
as in separate class libraries or folder
Etc
and we have views folder
in views folder The View folder holds
eraser Pages which are responsible for
showing and getting the data from the
users and we have app settings.json file
so this app setting.json folder contains
the configuration and secret details of
the application
and similarly we will have program.cs
file so program.cs file in solution
Explorer it is the file that is the
starting point of the application which
will create the host for an application
to run the application and we will have
startup.cs file the startup.cs file
allows to configure the behavior of the
application such as defining the routes
dependency injection so that was about
the few of the folders in solution
Explorer as we go further we will
explore other folders in detail so
asp.net web API basically it returns
data only the data may be from the
database and it does not return any view
or user interface and the asp.net web
API returns data in either XML format or
Json format so whenever you run an
application so suppose if we make an
application here and run an application
the application start methods get
invoked
so whenever you run an application the
first thing that happens is the
application start method gets invoked so
where is this method so this method is
in global dot ASX folder
let's open this so you can see here
application start so as you can see here
application start this is the method
which gets invoked first whenever we run
an application so basically this method
checks the routing so as you can see
here in this line we have the system
object sender the object sender supports
all classes in the dotnet framework the
class hierarchy provides low level
services to the drive classes this is
the ultimate base class of all the
classes in.net framework it is the root
of the type hierarchy and we also have
event argument it represents a base
class for the classes that contains even
data and provides a value to use for
events that do not include event data we
have area registration so area
registration provides a way to register
one or more areas in an asp.net MBC
application and this register all areas
this this is a register where all areas
in asp.net MVC application are
registered and we have Global
configuration.configure in this line
what happens is global configuration
provides a global HTTP configuration for
an asp.net application
and the register route store the URL
routes for an application and what is
this route table so basically route
table gets a collection of objects that
derive from the route based class and it
returns an object that contains all the
routes in the collection so now the
question is where is the route file so
to find the route file go to the app
start
go to this folder in this folder we have
two files route config.cs and web API
config.cs so this route config.cs stores
the routes and web API config.cs stores
the web apis so open this route
config.cs
so this is the file where we have class
route configuration so as you can see
here route config this is the public
class and we have register routes route
collection so route collection it
provides a collection of routes for
asp.net routing
and we have the parameter routes dot
ignore route so ignore route ignores the
specified URL route for the given list
of available routes and and this class
system dot string represents the text as
a sequence of code units and we have map
route map route Maps the specified URL
route and sets the default route values
and returns a referenced to the mapped
routes
similarly we have three parameters that
is name URL and defaults name is a
string and URL is the controller you
have controller action and id id is
optional and default are the objects so
we have three objects here controller
action and ID and we have specified it
as optional so basically this route
config.cs is the MVC application where
the routes are present so now the
question is where are the web API routes
so the web API routes are in the web API
config.cs file so open this file so as
you can see here the public static class
web API config so we have web API
configuration and services and web API
routes here so config dot routes dot map
HTTP route
so here the route gets the HTTP route
collection associated with this HTTP
configuration instance
so what is this map HTTP route
the map has CTP route Maps specified
route template and sets the default
route values and it returns a reference
to the mapped route it has a string a
route template and object default so it
has a string named as default API and a
route template with API controller and
we have default object as ID is equal to
Route parameter which is optional
so this I ID is equal to Route parameter
optional this is the route parameter
class that can be used to indicate
properties about a route parameter now
we have understood about routes and web
apis so now let us go to the controller
folder
so as you can see this is empty folder
but before that we will close this files
so go to the controller folder
right click and go to add
and add a controller
and go to web API
and here you can see web API to
controller empty so here we have five
different types of web API controllers
one is the empty the other one is web
API to controller with actions using
Entity framework similarly we have a web
API controller with read and write
actions we have controller with actions
using Entity framework and with read and
write actions for data version V3
so for this project we will select web
API to controller empty so select this
add it
so we need to provide the controller
name
so we will keep as it is default
controller so we'll provide it as
default data controller as the
controller name
so controller is mandatory
to be kept in the name and you can
change the other part so we have
provided the name now let's click on ADD
so this is the default data controller
which got created so namespace this is
the name of the project and as you can
see here with the extension controller
so this is the controller which we have
created and the name of the controller
is default data controller
so this API controller it basically
defines the property and method for an
API controller so next we'll write
a few lines of code here first we'll
call a string will keep it public
string
we'll call the array of string
then we'll call it as my data
is equal
so we'll
declare some values in the string say
data one
data 2
and data 3.
so just randomly I've called some values
just to for an example
so
next we'll call and another string we'll
keep it as public
public string
array array of string then we'll use the
get method get data
next we'll return this data
return my data
so we'll save this next we'll click on
run
so the build has started
so we need to call the controller web
API controller which we created for that
first enter the API
foreign
ER name so the controller which we
created was default data
next content so here we go this is the
array of string in XML format
so this was the strings which we created
XML is the extensible markup language
XML is basically used to describe data
the XML standard is a flexible way to
create information formats and share
structured data via the public internet
so how XML basically works so it works
by providing a predictable data format
XML is a strict on formatting if the
formatting is off programs and processor
display the encoded data will return an
error so this is the registration form
which we are going to create wherein we
will have employee name employee ID date
of birth Department country with drop
down and address contact number and the
gender and we'll create a save button
so this is the registration form we are
going to create
so we'll get started we'll jump into
Visual Studio
go to visual studio click on create new
project
scroll down and select asp.net web
application.net framework select this
template and click on next
and enter the project name
since we are creating a registration
form I'll enter the project name as
registration form
click on create
so basically we are creating a web form
so select web form
click on create
so here you can see the project
registration form is successfully
created
if you scroll down here in the solution
Explorer you will see site Master open
this
foreign
so this is the file which has the home
about and all the contact page
information so let us run this file
it has started
so this is the output wherein we have
the application name
home
about
and contact so what we'll do is we'll
create an another heading called
registration in inside which we will
create a registration form so for that
we'll go back to the
site Master page in the visual studio
so next to contact we'll create another
heading for that we'll copy this
and paste and we'll rename it as
registration
and we'll
change the link
save this
let's go back and check it
so here you can see registration is
added
so go back to visual studio
go to the registration form
right click
go to add
new item
in add new item select the template web
form with Master page select this
name the web form
so I'll name it as employee registration
employee
registration
click on ADD
select site dot master
and click on OK
so this is the employee registration
page which we have created so go back to
site master and add the link here to the
registration bit
and save it
if you want to change the footer you can
change the footer here
so let us go back to the employee
registration page and create the
registration form here
so here I have pasted a few lines of
code
firstly I have created a section ID so
the section HTML element basically it
represents a generic Standalone section
of a document so which doesn't have a
more specific element to represent it
and ID is a global attribute that
defines an identifier so I have created
a section ID called main content and a
section class called wrapper so class is
an attribute which specifies one or more
class names for an HTML element
so the class attribute can be used on
any HTML element
so we have created a diff class called
row so div is the content division
element it is a generic container for
flow content
so here we have created a div class
called column large that is 12000 pixel
the pixel numbers are the breakpoints
similarly we have diff class column
medium four so this is basically for a
maximum width of the container that is
720 pixel and we have written the
heading in H1 that is the registration
form so we'll save this and run and see
the output
so here you can see we have created The
Heading registration form
now we'll go back and create the
employee name department and other
details
similarly so now we'll create the
columns for employee name and employee
details so after the header
and paste a small three four lines of
code so basically here I have created a
class called panel body and inside the
class row with the column medium of
length that is greater than 720 pixel
so basically here I have created the
column employee name
let us save this
and click on run
so here you can see we have created the
employee name so similarly we'll create
the employee ID details contact number
and the country so go back to visual
studio
so similarly now we have created
employee name
after creating the employee name I have
pasted a small code wherein we have
created the employee ID same as the
employee name
similarly we have created the date of
birth and we have created Department
and the country for Country we have
created a drop down with a list of items
so we have provided the list of country
names that is India Pakistan China and
so on similarly we have created a column
for address
and if we scroll down we have created a
column for contact number and for gender
and for gender we have provided the list
and we have at last created a save
button to create a button we have
created a class and we have now provided
the ID as button save
so let's save this
and click on run and see the output
so you can see here so we have
successfully created the registration
form with the employee name so we can
enter the employee name
and employ ID
and date of birth date of birth you can
select the month year and
the day
similarly
enter the department country
and enter the address
contact number
let the category
and click on Save
so
this is the registration form so we have
successfully created the registration
form
we'll first start with who is an asp.net
developer
asp.net developer is responsible for
Designing Solutions and monitoring
existing and new applications
the responsibilities of asp.net
developers include writing code
designing solution for applications
managing performance analyzing
requirements and improving functionality

skills of an asp.net developer
let us first look at the some of the
technical skills that are required for
an asp.net developer
firstly we
have.net.net is a free cross-platform
open source framework for building
different applications knowledge of
coding using.net languages
asp.net core MVC asp.net core MBC is an
application framework that allows you to
create modern web apps by using the MVC
architectural pattern
servers and database SQL Server is a
relationship database management system
or rdbms developed and marketed by
Microsoft
the other skills are client-side
Technologies such as jQuery HTML CSS and
JavaScript developers should possess
good understanding of these client-side
Technologies
some of the non-technical skills are the
asp.net developer should be very
creative
and he should have good strategic
planning and he should have good
communication skills similarly good
analytical skills and problem solving
skills and the time management skills
come in handy

the interview plays a vital role in any
job selection process for that reason
preparation is key technical questions
are part of the interview process which
impact more in the interview
hey everyone I welcome you all to this
session in this session we will see
asp.net interview questions with answers
if you are planning to start your career
as a developer you have to possess some
development skills that Empower your
ability to crack the interview
if you want to make a career in software
development and improve your chances
then this video on asp.net interview
questions and answers will help you make
your preparation easy but before we
begin make sure you have subscribed to
our YouTube channel and click down the
Bell icon so you never miss an update
from Simply learn so without wasting any
further time let's get started
we will look at the first category of
asp.net interview questions that is
beginner level interview questions
what is asp.net
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing Dynamic websites and web
applications on the internet
it also produces data driven web
application
Microsoft released asp.net in 2002 to
build Dynamic websites and web
applications using the.net framework
what platform does asp.net use
asp.net is a cross-platform which works
on the.net framework and runs on Linux
Windows Mac OS and docker
what is the asp.net lifecycle and list
the types of life cycle when asp.net
Pages run it goes through several steps
of the life cycle which performs a
series of actions like initialization
running restoring and rendering
lifecycle is classified into two
categories application life cycle and
Page lifecycle
in application lifecycle the user
request for accessing the application
page lifecycle has faces like
initialization restoring execution and
Page rendering
what is MVC
so MVC is basically a software
architectural pattern that divides an
application into three main parts that
is model view and controller
model helps to create the data domain of
the application and represents the
public properties and business logic of
the application
view view represent the data tables
charts and diagrams by collecting the
data from the model
controller the controller helps in
handling the user interactions and
controls the flow of the application
list the languages used for asp.net
esp.net uses object oriented programming
languages that provide a framework and
patterns which are easy to use languages
used by asp.net framework are C sharp or
vb.net c-sharp is a programming language
developed by Microsoft that runs on the
dotnet framework it is used for
developing web applications on the.net
framework
vb.net is a modern object oriented
programming language developed by
Microsoft to combine the features of CLR
and dotnet
what type of library is used in asp.net
a library is a pre-coded object-oriented
programming template collection used to
develop web-based and desktop
applications in asp.net
asp.net uses a web library to develop
web applications what is CLR
CLR is the basic common language runtime
virtual machine component of the.net
framework used to run the code it
manages the executing.net programs and
implements a virtual execution system
internally
services that CLR provide are
verification garbage collection security
and memory management
what is IIs and why do you use it
internet information server IIs is the
most popular web server used to host and
provide internet Based Services to
asp.net and ASP web applications
IIs has its own process engine to handle
the request using an IIs computer one
can work as a web server and provides
functionally to deploy asp.net web
applications
it is also responsible for providing
responses to the request made by the
users
list the types of application life cycle
application lifecycle is of five types
application start object creation HTTP
application dispose and application end
application start is a method that you
execute when a user makes a request
object creation contains all the
information about current request and
browsing information
HTTP application processes all
subsequent requests sent to the
application
dispose
dispose is responsible for releasing
manually unwanted resources
application end helps to unload the
memory of an application
list the advantages of using asp.net
asp.net is a development framework that
is used for developing web applications
it is one of the most preferred web
development Technologies at present
there are a lot of benefits of using
asp.net here are some of its advantages
applications created using asp.net show
better performance
esp.net provides multi-development modes
for the applications
applications created using asp.net can
be used across the globe
esp.net is a language independent
what is an active server page
active server page is an HTML page used
to develop Dynamic web pages it includes
one or more scripts on the Microsoft web
server before sending the request to the
user ESP was first released in December
1996 it is used to generate the content
that is sent to the client web browser
via the HTTP response
describe web forms web forms are web
pages that a user request using a
browser it is built using asp.net
technology
it executes on the server and generates
output to the browser it also allows you
to add and create custom controls
some of the custom controls provided by
asp.net are label text box button
hyperlink and image button
what is a solution Explorer
solution Explorer displays the folder
and files of a project that appears on a
physical hard drive
list the components of asp.net
asp.net provides data driven web
applications on the internet using
various components
some of the components are common
language runtime language Library common
type system and windows forms
what is the difference between ASP and
asp.net
ESP is the first server-side scripting
language developed by Microsoft to
design Dynamic web forms whereas asp.net
is a server-side technology used for
developing Dynamic websites and web
applications on the internet
ASP uses Ado that is ActiveX data
objects to connect with the database
whereas asp.net uses
ado.net to connect with the database ASP
is written in vbscript
asp.net is written in C sharp
what type of protocol is used to call
web service
web service is a web-based functionality
accessed by using protocols it uses XML
to exchange the software using common
internet protocols
web service in asp.net has three aspects
they are creating web service creating a
proxy consuming the web service the HTTP
protocol is used in asp.net to call a
web service
explain users of global.asax
Global file is used to execute the
application Level events and set
application Level variables
Global dot ASX is used to handle
high-level applications like application
start session and and session start
now let us look at some of the
intermediate level asp.net interview
questions and answers what is a web
Library
web library is a part of a website that
accesses all libraries from the browser
and helps in adding collections online
it contains base and user-defined data
types
boom
it supports to create web services
describe a view state
view state is a page level State
Management technique that is used to
preserve the values of the page and
controls
view state contains the sections like
features background scenario and class
reference
what is a multi-view
multi-view is a parent control for the
view it is used to control all types of
the view multiview has the prefix MV
this is the syntax of multi-view
what is early binding
early binding is used to check the
methods and properties during
compilation
it is fast and easy to code and also
reduces the compilation time it also
reduces the time by identifying the
errors
what is lead binding lead binding takes
more time to compile it is hard to find
out the object through late binding lead
binding has Dynamic objects and is
achieved by virtual machines
how asp.net is different from asp.net
core
asp.net is used to build application for
Windows whereas asp.net core is used for
Windows Mac OS and Linux
asp.netusers.net framework whereas
asp.net core users.net core framework
asp.net is a single version
asp.net core has multiple versions
what is catching
catching is a technique used to sort the
user data or information in memory it
boosts the performance of the
applications and creates Pages
automatically
catching is also essential for data
related transactions
what is the role of page directives
page directives describe the attributes
of specific page file for the compiler
below is the syntax of page directives
where code file specifies the name of
code behind the file
and debug enables or specifies
compilation debug
and client name specifies the class name
of the page
and decline Target browsers the server
controls
list the types of states in asp.net
state in asp.net is used to store the
information between request and to
retrieve it when required and holding
the information
asp.net provides four types of States
application State cookie State view
State and session state
application state in this state all
collections of web pages and files in a
single directory on a web server
cookie state it stores the information
on the client machine view States
view State States the state of web pages
and its control
session State this state is used to sort
the application data
list the sources of data Allowed by
asp.net
data sources are responsible for
operations like insertion deletion
sorting and updates some of the data
sources Allowed by asp.net are SQL data
source object data source and access
data source
list the events of calendar control
calendar control is a function used to
provide a calendar on a web page it also
enables you to change and move to the
previous months and years
the events of calendar control are of
three types selection changed day render
and visible month changed
what is a Trace
tracing enables view diagnostic
information about a single request at
runtime and debug the application
the trace contains features backgrounds
code examples and class references
how can we add a style sheet in Visual
Studio
to add a stylesheet open solution
Explorer and right click on the option
then click on new and the pop-up will
appear to choose
how can a page layout help in asp.net
page layout provides an overall
container for the pages on the website
for example navigation area and footer
page layout also includes the main event
list the advantages of using HTML server
controls
HTML server controls are the standard
HTML controls used to enable server-side
processing some of the advantages of
using HTML server controls are HTML
server control does not process any
mechanism to identify the capabilities
of a client browser coding can be easy
by adding run nut is equal to server
attribute controls can interact with the
client-side scripting
explain about event bubbling
even bubbling is used by data bound
controls when a parent control contains
child controls and when an event occurs
in the child controls it bubbles the
event to the parent this is called event
bubbling
even bubbling is classified into two
categories on Bubble event that handles
the even data rice bubble event that
sends the event data
list the most common built-in objects of
asp.net
built-in objects access the information
from the web server
it is also responsible for recognizing
the client who is accessing the web page
some of the commonly built-in objects of
asp.net are context application request
server trace and response
list types of catching
catching is a technique used to sort the
user data or information in memory
caching is divided into three types
output catching it specifies a duration
of catch and the attribute fragment
catching it is user control catching
used in a basic web form page data
caching it is used for catching the data
of the data source controls
what are breakpoints
breakpoint helps to specify the run time
to run a line and stop the execution it
is used to examine and perform various
debugging functions and methods
now let us look at some of the advanced
level interview questions
list any five web controls in asp.net
web controls are HTML elements used for
script tagging and functionality for web
forms and pages
the five web controls in asp.net are as
follows
HTML controls HTML server controls user
and custom controls asp.net server
controls asp.net Ajax server controls
what are button controls
button controls in asp.net are used to
display a push button on a web page
this is the Syntax for button controls
where you provide button ID and run at
server and the text is of the type
button
what is range validator and its syntax
range validator checks the input values
that lie in between the specified ranges
rage validator has three main properties
that is type minimum value and maximum
value
this is the syntax of range validator
wherein we have provided minimum value
as 1 and maximum value as 6 and it is of
the type integer
what is a threat priority
in multi-threading each thread has its
own priority that gains access to CPU
resources
whenever a thread is created in C sharp
it always possesses some priority it is
mainly used to set up value
what is the role of post pack in asp.net
pushback is a request sent from a client
to the server from the page on which the
user is working it puts the complete
page back to the server for a new page
postback is submitted to a server before
processing the page and holds
credentials such as verification like
username and password using a database
list the types of authentication in
asp.net
authentication is a process of ensuring
the user identity it is divided into
four types form authentication Windows
authentication custom authentication and
passport Authentication
Define web configuration
web configuration is used to describe
the property and behavior of web
applications
it also helps to manage settings each
file of a web configuration is an XML
file that contains a set of
configuration elements
explain client-side script events
Blind Side script runs on the browser
and speeds up the execution of the page
some of the client-side events are as
follows on click it is used when the
control is clicked on focus it is used
when control receives the focus on
change is used when the value of control
is changed on blur is used when the
control loses Focus
on key press is used when the user
presses the key
what is anonymous personalization
Anonymous personalization helps and
allows the user to personalize this site
before identifying themselves for
example enable Anonymous identification
by passing the value true provide the
cookie name cookie timeout and cookie
path
and set cookie sliding expiration as
true and keep the cookie protection
encrypted and cookie less is equal to
user
what is form-based Authentication
form-based authentication is used to
edit the web configuration files and add
a login page to authenticate it is used
for web applications
form based authentication also provides
a way to handle authentication using
custom Logics in asp.net applications
Define the types of configuration files
right
configuration files help to manage the
settings of a website settings of
configuration files are stored as XML
files which are separate from the
application
configuration files are of two types web
configuration and machine configuration
web configuration contains the machine
specific value for all settings of the
applications
machine configurations help to extend
restrict and override the settings
list the different types of cookies used
in asp.net
cookies are a small piece of information
stored at decline site the cookies in
asp.net are provided into two types
session cookie valid for a single
session persistent cookie valid for
multiple sessions
explain the difference between custom
controls and user controls
custom controls is designed for a single
application
whereas user control is designed for
multiple applications custom control is
Loosely coupled user control is tightly
coupled user interface can be changed in
custom control whereas in user controls
the user interface is fixed
then the difference between web
configuration and machine configuration
files
web configuration is automatically
created when the application is created
whereas machine configuration is
automatically installed with the visual
studio
in web configuration file inherit
settings from the machine configuration
whereas in machine configuration only
one machine configuration exists
we will start with the beginner level
asp.net MBC interview questions and
answers
what is MVC
MVC is a software architectural pattern
that divides an application into three
major components MVC stands for model
view and controller the model represents
the shape of the data and stores the
data that it retrieves from the database
view view is a user interface used to
represent the data of the application as
tables charts and diagrams it also
communicates with models and controllers
easily
controller the controller in MVC holds
the user's request it handles the HTTP
request made by the user
explain the life cycle of MVC
lifecycle is a series of steps used to
handle the request to change the state
of the application
the life cycle of MVC is divided into
two categories application life cycle
and request life cycle application
lifecycle runs the IIs application until
it stops
the request lifecycle handles the HTTP
request of the application
list the advantages of using MVC
MVC has a lot of advantages with
building the application some of them
are MVC provides separation of
components that allows the ReUse of
applications across the several
platforms MVC allows applications to
change features like layouts fonts and
colors without affecting the entire
architecture of the application
MVC uses asynchronous techniques to
build applications that can be easy for
a developer to build application in a
faster and secure way
what are the actions and lists a few of
them
action methods in MVC execute the
request and generate the response
actions have one-to-one mapping with the
user
here is a list of few of the actions
content result it returns a string file
path result it Returns the file path
content file content result it returns
file content JavaScript result it
Returns the script for execution Json
result it returns Json formatted data
view result it helps to receive a
response for the view engine and file
stream result it returns file content
and redirect to result it helps to
redirect to the specified URL
what other actions filters and list the
types of action filters action filters
are attributes that apply to the
controller or a controller action that
helps in modifying the executed actions
MVC framework includes several actions
some of them are output catch output
Catch catches the output of a controller
at a specific time
handle error handle error handles the
error when it executes an action
authorize authorize enables you to
restrict access for a control
what are action verbs
action verbs are HTTP requests applied
to the action methods to work for HTTP
request methods
some of the action verbs are HTTP post
HTTP get HTTP put and HTTP delete
what are code blocks in MBC
code blocks in MVC are used to enclose
c-sharp statements
this is an example for code blocks it
starts with the symbol at the rate and
encloses with curly braces code blocks
work with loops and keywords in
different ways
what are helpers in MBC and is the types
of helpers
helpers in MVC are HTML classes that
help to create HTML control
programmatically
HTML helpers in MVC generate HTML and
result as a string
some of the different types of helper
methods that asp.net provides are create
links
create links is to get the information
from the routing tables create inputs
this helps to create text boxes and
buttons create form
handle post back to an action on a
different controller
what are non-action methods
non-action methods are attributes used
when a public method in a controller
does not want an action method
here is an example that shows how to
create a non-action method in MVC
what is model binding model binding in
MVC allows mapping the HTTP request data
with the models using the data sent by
the browser in an HTTP request
model binding also acts as a bridge
between the HTTP request and c-sharp
action methods using model binding it
automatically transfers post and get
into a specified data
explain the process of validation in MVC
validation in MVC is used to check the
user input and provides a set of
validation that is easy to use and
Powerful to check the errors of the user
what is a partial View
partial view is a view that is rendered
from the another view which helps to
break the larger view into smaller views
a partial view is also used to reduce
the duplication of the common markup
content across the markup files
what are logic layers
the logic layer defines and decides the
information needed to solve the assigned
problems
logically as in MVC are divided into
three types business layer display layer
and input control layer
what are the drawbacks of MVC there are
many advantages and disadvantages of
using MVC applications
you will Now understand some of the
disadvantages of using them
MVC is not suitable for large type
applications the complexity of the
applications is high using MVC it is
difficult to understand the design
pattern in MVC deployment of
applications is hard compared to the
other applications
what are file extensions for razor View
laser is a view engine used to write the
mix of HTML and server side
it is also a general purpose template
engine that does not provide any thighs
to the MVC which allows the creation of
new engine inside the application laser
in MVC contains laser markup c-sharp and
HTML
file extensions of laser view are
divided into two types
dot cshtml used for c-sharp DOT VB HTML
used for Visual Basic
what is an unobtrusive Ajax
it is a progressive enhancement that
focuses on the delivery of the content
HX calls in unobtrusive Ajax which are
made through built-in helpers to
eliminate the need to add the blocks of
code
what are get and post actions
get in MVC is used to request the data
from a specific resource it is the most
common HTTP method below is the syntax
of get action
post is used to send data to the server
to create an update a resource
below is the syntax of post-action
now let us look at intermediate level
interview questions
what is a resource
razor is a view engine used to write the
mix of HTML and server side it is also a
general purpose template engine that
does not provide any ties to MVC which
allows creating a view engine inside the
application
below is the syntax in C sharp it is dot
CS HTML in Visual Basic it is dot VB
HTML
what is exceptional handling in MVC
exceptional handling in MBC is used to
execute the action methods using try and
catch blocks it is the process for
responding to the exceptional condition
for the special processing
for example here in this program you
will create an exception for the
application that shows an error on the
web page that displays a custom error
message or custom error pages
what is a layout View
layout view in MVC allows creating a
common site template that inherits
multiple views to provide a consistent
look for an application
the layout view has the same extension
as other views which you can store in
the shared folder
esp.net MVC layout allows the child
views using some methods like render
section method and render body method
what are web apis
web API is a platform used to build
restful applications using.net
Frameworks that include small and large
application for devices tablets and
mobile devices
here is an example for web apis this is
a basic program to add the configuration
of web API in the configuration folder
of the MVC application using the name
web API config
what is form authentication in MVC
form authentication in MVC is
responsible for users credentials like
sign up sign in login and logout
it also provides a way to handle
authentication using custom Logics in
asp.net applications
you can do form authentication using the
SQL database to provide the user
credentials and information it is used
to edit the web configuration files and
and add a login page to authenticate
explain bootstrap and its use
bootstrap is a front-end framework tool
used for web applications to build a
user interface using HTML CSS and
JavaScript
it was first developed by Twitter
Developers for personal use and became
popular with the designer and developers
with flexibility
bootstrap provides all pieces of layouts
menus fonts widgets and other many
features you can find bootstrap files in
the solution Explorer as bootstrap.css
and bootstrap.js
what are Glimpse in MVC
Glimpse in MVC is a free and open source
nugget platform used to perform
operations like performance debugging
and diagnosis for the applications it
allows users to find information about
every action by the server including the
Azure test in the application
list the types of action results in MBC
action result is an action method used
along with an action it is the result of
action execution the action result is a
return type action results are divided
in MVC into three categories status
results content returning result and
redirection result status result provide
the status of the code to the browser
content returning result is responsible
for returning the content and
redirection result redirects the
specified URL
what is a request life cycle
request lifecycle is a sequence of
events that occur when the application
handles the HTTP request
request lifecycle involves 5 Steps
routing MVC Handler controller action
invoker and result execution
routing is used to map the incoming URL
to the router and creates request
content and sends it to the next layer
MVC Handler is responsible for creating
the controller instance controller is
used to deal with the request and
implement the controller interface
action invoker is used to execute the
action method sent by the controller
result execution is responsible for the
execution of action method in the
controller
explain the ways of adding the
constraints to a router
constraints to a router in MBC are added
in two ways
using the object that implements the
router constraint interface or using the
regular expressions
explain routing in MVC
routing is the process of mapping the
browser request to the controller and
Responding back router handles the
information and URL patterns in routing
and it stores all the configured files
to the application in the routing tables
routing in MVC is divided into two types
convention based routing and attribute
based routing
this is an example of registering the
routing with different custom routes
using the name default the default maps
with the URL pattern in the routing
table
what is output caching
output caching is responsible for
improving the performance of the
application it also enables you to
remove unwanted actions
below is the example for output caching
mention the benefits of areas
areas in MVC allowed to organize the
models views and controllers into a
separate function in the application
like building support Etc
let's see some benefits of using areas
in MVC
using areas it is easy to perform unit
testing it allows you to separate the
functional sections of the applications
it also helps in communicating with the
other areas by creating another area
what is a view start
view start is introduced by a view
engine that applies to all views
automatically below is an example for
reviewed sort
what is attribute routing
attribute routing is a type of routing
that provides more control over the URL
by defining routers directly on the
actions and controller in the
application
some of the advantages of using
attribute routing are it reduces the
chance of errors in the application it
is easy to map routes pointing to the
same action it provides more control
over the URL
how to change the action names in MVC
the action name attribute is used to
change the action name in MVC
explain data annotations
data annotations in MVC are responsible
for providing the instance checking for
the client side
MVC provides various data annotations
some of them are required is used to
indicate the property of the required
field
string length is used to indicate the
string length
bind is used to include or exclude The
Binding parameters email address is used
to Value the email address
what is the difference between MVC and
web forms MVC is based on a design
pattern that helps to clear the
application faster
web forms are based on functions and
code behind MVC provides HTML helpers to
create the controls whereas in web form
every control in web form has server
control MVC is used to create partial
views and web forms are used to create
user controls there is no view state in
MBC view state in waveforms is used to
maintain the state it is easy to use
jQuery JavaScript and CSS in MDC web
forms use a little jQuery and JavaScript
differentiate between view bag and view
data
view bag is used to transfer the
temporary data from the controller to
our view view data is used to transfer
data from the controller to the view
bag is a type of object whereas view
data is a key value collection view back
is slower than view data and view data
is faster than view back
view back Works only on dotnet 4.0 and
above view data works on dot net 3.5 and
above mu bag is used as Dynamic so no
need for type conversion
whereas in view data type conversion is
required
explain Scaffolding in MVC
scap folding is a technique used as code
generation for asp.net web applications
it also generates code for crude
operations using the Entity framework
models
it reduces the time and generates clean
code while creating the application it
is automatically installed in visual
studio 2013 and above versions
explain the difference between temp data
and view back
temp data is a key value collection
whereas viewbag is a type of object
temp data is used to pass data between
two consecutive requests view back
values becomes null
temp data works during the current and
subsequent request view back Works only
at the current time temp data works on
dotnet 3.5 and above your bag works with
dotnet 4.0 and above
explain the difference between render
page and render body
render page is a layout page that
contains content filled by the other
pages
whereas render body is a method of
Master page or is or commonly used as a
layout page
render page is obviously present in the
layout view render body doesn't have a
fixed path
render page does not include any
parameters but render body always
includes the parameters like Boolean
multiple methods are not allowed in
render page
render body allows multiple methods
list a few rules of resource synthresor
is a view engine used to create web
applications by combining the features
of MVC there are certain rules to be
followed for the razor they are laser
block having C sharp and enclosed with
curly braces variables are always
declared with the VAR keyword variables
and functions within line always start
with the symbol at the rate
c-sharp file has an extension of Dot
cshtml
code statements always end with
semicolon
now let us look at the advanced level
interview questions
what are bundling and minification
bundle is a logical group of physical
files used to improve the performance of
the application by providing the inbuilt
features bundled into a single file
which improves the performance using
HTTP request known as bundling
this program below shows all the bundles
of CSS files present in the folder of
finally
minification is a technique of removing
the unnecessary comments and characters
from CSS and JavaScript to reduce the
size to improve the performance of the
application
below is the example of minification
it alerts if the number is even or if
the number is odd
what is Json binding
Json binding is known as JavaScript
object notation binding that supports
mvc3 using Json value provider Factory
it allows action methods to accept and
model bind data in Json binding
this is a simple program that shows how
to bind data using Json binding
what is cross domain Ajax
HX cross domain sends a request to
refresh the URL domain of the web pages
there are many ways to implement and use
the cross domain Ajax the most commonly
used cross domain hxr send Json
pre-request and cross domain resource
sharing
explain the usage of remote validation
in MVC
remote validation is the process of
validating specific data posting to a
server without posting the entire data
to the server this program on remote
validation helps in checking the
validation of the user using the
parameter username and the displays the
message name already exists
list the standard HTML helpers in MVC
standard HTML helpers in MVC are used to
render the HTML controls like label text
box password checkbox Etc
some of the standard HTML helpers in
mvcr html text box it is used to create
a text box HTML password this is used to
create a text box with password identity
next we have HTML checkbox it is used to
create the property in the checkbox HTML
radio button it automatically displays
the property in the radio button
explain the implementation of Ajax in
MVC
Ajax is asynchronous Javascript and XML
client-side script that communicates to
the database without any need from the
postback it also speeds the responses
time in the application
below is the syntax of Ajax in MBC
explain about MVC model binders
model binders in MVC allow mapping HTTP
request with the model
it works when a user requests the data
from the browser to the controller at
this time model binding works on
middleman to map the incoming request
with the controller action method
update model method function observes
the request and updates the model class
this program is process of adding the
controller with the index action method
to the MVC
explain areas in MVC
areas in MVC allow organizing the model
view and controllers into a separate
function in the application like
building support Etc it is mainly used
for large applications
when the developer or user is working
with the area it is important to
register with the areas
the Syntax for registering the areas is
as follows in this each MVC has its own
area folder that allow it to keep
controllers models and Views separately
explain the roles of presentation
abstraction and control in MVC
presentation obstruction and control is
an architectural pattern that separates
MVC interactive system into three types
of components presentation
presentation in MVC is responsible for
formats of the visual and audio
presentation of the data
abstraction is responsible for
retrieving information and processing
the data control handles the flow of
control the communication between two
components
explain the uses of keep and peak in MVC
keep in MVC is used to preserve the data
of temp data after the value is read
peak in MBC is used to read the value in
temp data without clearing the data
here are some differences between keep
and Peak
key provides two overloading methods
whereas Peak provides no overloading
method once the data is read by the keep
then the data is erased the data in Peak
Remains the Same after the operation is
successful in keep redirect to result
and redirect to Route result are called
to get the items back
in Peak there is no action called by the
peak internally to retrieve so here we

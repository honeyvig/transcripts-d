ONE SERVICE I WANTED TO SHOWCASE
TODAY IS THE AZURE SPEECH SERVICE.
NOT ONLY IS THE SPEECH SERVICE
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WHEN IT
COMES TO SPEECH RECOGNITION, IN FACT WHAT
YOU’LL SEE IN THIS
DEMO, IS EVEN FOR COMMODITY HARDWARE, TO REPLACE
ANY MICROARRAY
SETUP SO THAT YOUR SPEECH
RECOGNITION IS WORD
CLASS.
THE MOST INTERESTING THING WHEN YOU
COMBINE SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH
LANGUAGE MODELS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO
YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL
DATA, YOU CAN START PICKING UP
ALL THE JARGON.
SO IMAGINE A TRANSCRIPT THAT GETS
CREATED THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO
UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL JARGON THAT'S
SPECIFIC TO YOUR
ORGANIZATION, YOUR
INDUSTRY, THAT WAY MAKING THE TRANSCRIPT
THAT MUCH MORE
USEFUL.
LET'S THROW IT TO OUR TEAM OUT
ON THE GALLERY TO
SHOW YOU SPEECH TRANSLATION AND TRIPS.
THE PROTOTYPE DEVICE YOU CONNECTED TO A
CLOUD SERVICE THAT PROVIDED LIVE
TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION.
WE ARE PROUD TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT
WE'RE MAKING THE CONVERSATIONS
TRANSCRIPTION CAPABILITY WITHIN AZURE
SPEECH SERVICES AVAILABLE AS A PREVIEW
RELEASE.
COME ON, LET ME SHOW YOU.
YOU MIGHT ALSO REMEMBER THIS
HARDWARE FROM LAST YEAR, WHICH
WE'RE MAKING AVAILABLE AS DEVELOPER
DEVICE KIT.
TODAY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE
GOING TO GIVE YOU A DEMO OF NEW
RESEARCH THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE
MEETING TRANSCRIPTIONS MORE EASILY
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IN THE
FUTURE.
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU THIS DEMO
USING JUST THE MICROPHONES BUILT INTO
THIS LAPTOP AND THESE TWO SMARTPHONES
WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US.
WITH THESE, WE
CREATE A MICROPHONE ARRAY IN THE CLOUD
THAT ENABLES AZURE SPEECH SERVICES
TO PROVIDE
ACCURATE,
IN-PERSON MEETING
TRANSCRIPTIONS EVEN WITHOUT A SPECIAL MEETING
DEVICE.
>> ALSO, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT I
DIDN'T BRING MY PHONE, BUT IT
CAN STILL RECOGNIZE MY VOICE AND
CORRECTLY IDENTIFY ME, BECAUSE I'VE
GIVEN IT PERMISSION TO USE MY VOICEPRINT
TO TRANSCRIBE WHAT I SAY.
THE SECOND THING WE'RE GOING TO
SHOW YOU IS THAT THE LANGUAGE
MODEL OF THE AZURE SPEECH
SERVICE CAN BE TRAINED ON THE
DATA IN YOUR COMPANY'S MICROSOFT
365 TENANT SO IT CAN LEARN THE
UNIQUE VOCABULARY OF YOUR
INDUSTRY OR COMPANY.
THIS IS AVAILABLE IN PRIVATE
PREVIEW.
SO BASICALLY, FOR THE NEXT TWO MINUTES,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RAP BATTLE OF
SORTS.
BUT FOR ALL OF US GEEKS HERE IN THE
ROOM.
HEIKO IS A PRINCIPAL PM ON THE
SPEECH TEAM AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE
US AN EXAMPLE OF SOME DEV SPEAK.
YUSEF IS IN HEALTH CARE MARKETING
AND HE'S GOING TO
DAZZLE US WITH HEALTH CARE TECH
JARGON.
SO WHILE THEY SPEAK, I ENCOURAGE
YOU TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE
TRANSCRIPT ON THE SCREEN SO
YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW POWERFUL THIS
SERVICE IS.
HEIKO, TAKE US AWAY.
>> AZURE SPEECH SERVICES ARE
BUILT WITH VMS RUNNING ON AZURE
HYPERVISORS USING UBUNTU BASED
DOCKER CONTAINERS THAT ARE
ORCHESTRATED WITH THE AZURE
KUBERNETES SERVICE.
AZURE SPEECH SERVICES ENABLE A
VARIETY OF TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES
INCLUDING
ASR, NEURAL
TTS, MICROSOFT TRANSLATOR
AND RELATED CUSTOM SERVICES.
YOU CAN ACCESS THESE USING YOUR
FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,
SUCH AS JAVA, JAVASCRIPT,
NODE.JS, C++, OR C# AND OTHERS.
THE BAR HAS BEEN SET.
OKAY.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO GIVE US A
BIT OF THIS HEALTH CARE JARGON.
>> MICROSOFT TEAMS CAN PROVIDE
EHR INTEGRATION THROUGH ISV
VENDORS INCLUDING INFOR
CLOVERLEAF, REDOX AND OTHERS VIA
THE HL7 FHIR STANDARD.
HL7 FHIR IS HIPAA, MARS-E AND
GDPR COMPLIANT AND IS BASED ON A
MODERN TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING
HTTPS AND RESTFUL
PROTOCOLS AS WELL AS EXTENSIBLE
APIs.
THE FHIR OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY
MAKES THEIR SOURCE AVAILABLE ON
GITHUB AND THE MICROSOFT TEAMS FHIR
IMPLEMENTATION ASK ALSO ALIGNED WITH
PROJECT ARGONAUT AND
FOLLOWS THE U.S. CORE PROFILES FOR
ALL THE FHIR RESOURCES IT CONSUMES.
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.
I'M GOING TO CALL
THAT A DRAW.
WHILE WE'RE GOING A BIT OVERBOARD,
WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT SO THAT EVERY COMPANY WITH
THEIR SPECIFIC JARGON CAN HAVE
ACCURATE TRAN DESCRIPTIONS.
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT WHERE THIS
WORK WILL TAKE US AND OUR FUTURE
AMBITION IS TO ENABLE TRANSCRIPTIONS
FOR ANYONE ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME.

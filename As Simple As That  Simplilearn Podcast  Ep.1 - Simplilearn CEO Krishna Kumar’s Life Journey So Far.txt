from an engineer who briefly floated in
the Seas of the corporate world to the
Visionary who excelled in the startup
Universe Krishna developed the art of
building experimenting and rebuilding
this Artistry helped him establish
himself as the Pioneer in the world of
professional upskilling Krishna is a
landmine of stories experiences and
insights and he believes everyone has a
story on simply learn's very own
homegrown podcast as simple as that
Krishna will be Dawning the Hat of a
podcaster conversing with Learners
industry leaders business partners and
anyone who has insights to share we are
kicking off the series with Krishna
sharing his own story in an engaging
conversation with his longtime friend
the current chief product officer of
Simply learn and a man who has a way
with words Anand Naran so come let's di
right
[Music]
in
[Applause]
hello viewers welcome to the first
episode of what we call as simple as
that um it's a series of conversations
that we hope will inspire you but more
importantly give you insights into very
important and heavy topics in a very
casual atmosphere so welcome again this
idea is a concept of Krishna so Krishna
before we get into the specific details
today and you're the first guest that's
going to talk about their life today I'm
actually is in your own words what is as
simple as that why are we here today
what do you think we're trying to do
today so thanks an thanks for the
introduction and hello everyone so this
idea came uh to me I think couple of
weeks back as you know the podcasts are
getting a lot of popularity like people
are getting uh a lot of viewership of
and they they're hearing successful
entrepreneurs Sports personalities
leaders and so on and in the process
they learn a lot right but one thing
that was going on in my mind that why
are people watching the podcast of only
successful people right everybody is
successful in their own right because
everyone's circumstances is different
their challenges are different their
struggles are different and if you look
at simply learn as a business what do we
do we do we help people realize their
true potential through upskilling and
giving them the right kind of guidance
so we thought that it might be a great
idea if we can bring in some of our
Learners who have gone through their
journey and bring that personal angle
from their stories that you can relate
to and it might help you inspire it
might help you think through your own
challenges in maybe in a much better way
compared to how we are thinking about it
today so that's the whole idea on this
podcast we going to interview common
people with the uncommon story people
who have done remarkably remarkably well
in their lives for for various reasons
and they have they might not be as
successful as some of these who's and
who of the world that you hear about but
you might find their story in
interesting so that's the whole concept
on what a wonderful idea by the way
speaking of common people with uncommon
sto stories U actually that's a perfect
fitting platform for Krishna um so
Krishna you and I share a common sort of
background we both lived in villages
we've come from very small towns and
we've come to wherever we are today so I
think um absolutely not common and
definitely uncommon story so Krishna we
are going to go back a little bit in
history uh I'd like to understand you
know you started from extremely humble
beginnings you've gone through a lot of
hardships during those times I'm sure
there are a lot of good lessons and
tough lessons you learned at that time
could you share maybe a little bit of
those early Beginnings to your life and
how that has impacted you as you think
of your life today sure an so as you
rightly said that I grew up in a village
so till fifth grade I studied in a
government
uh it used to be called Middle School in
a in a in a village in Bihar it was part
of a district called which is now Cur
District it used to be bosur District
during those time and during I think it
must be early ' 80s right because of
course I was born in 77 so early ' 80s I
don't remember we had electricity in our
in our Village nor we had roads in our
village I think I saw electricity for
the first time when I went to another
Village in in some other cont one of my
relatives house or something and I saw
there's a bulb and then I realized okay
how does it work and of course in that
Village also it was not so consistent it
was not that it was always on but but I
got to know something that I never seen
and of course now the great news is that
India if you go to any Village anywhere
it's all like you know it's all
electrified so great progress everywhere
there are roads but during those time it
was not the case so but what I also
realized during this process that even
as a kid with no knowledge about
anything there of course there was no
internet during those time I was always
very aspirational like I always wanted
to to think of myself that okay if I if
you put the right effort and if you
think about growing you'll find Avenues
to grow and again one thing led to
another and eventually I ended up being
in Patna and of course Patna is a one of
the the education capitals of of India
people are very aspirational you'll hear
a lot of um like maybe negative things
about that part of our country but one
thing is consistent that we'll find lot
of successful people who have done
extremely well in all fields of life
that you can think of so yeah the
beginning it was like in the first few
years in the village was was really very
less exposure but once I went to Patna I
had opportunity to get to study in Loa
School Patna which is one of the best
school in Patna and then that really
gave me a great platform to think bigger
I just was reminising my own childhood
uh there was you were talking about not
having power we of course had power but
it used to be 5 days a week power cut
two days a week we have power so it's
interesting times for sure at the time
um but maybe Krishna let's get into sort
of the schooling you went to Patna you
went to a very good school big change
from the village um what were your first
experiences what are the big Lessons
Learned there what is the difference
from your early life when you went to
the school and how did these learning
shape your future thinking
so even when I was in was in my my
school in my Village I was always a good
student obviously that's what my
teachers used to tell me because maybe
other students were either they didn't
had access to they had maybe even less
resources than me maybe because and they
had nobody in the home to guide at least
my father even though he was he was into
temporary job during the time I used to
stay in Village but he was a lecturer in
a university right so I had that kind of
privilege compared to other even less
privileged students in my class in
school but I went to Patna Patna laa
school was one of the best school that
you can get into and there I got to meet
all kinds of like classmates some of
them had very very strong background
some of them had we like extremely
bright so so that brought a lot of I'll
say positive competitive pressure right
because everybody is so good then you
also try to become good and and that has
been my one of my biggest learning that
the only way for you to improve either
as a company as an individual is that
you put yourself in a competitive
scenario because the competition brings
best out of it and that's something as
you have seen in simply also we admire
so much some of our competitors because
I think they they push us to work even
harder and do even better so so that was
one learning that being a being a good
good company because if you're in a good
company you also become good and uh
education is going to have a huge
difference uh to someone's life that's a
investment that you can't um U like
there's there's no other investment that
can match like if you if you know
mathematics of course you know
mathematics there's this component
called there's this concept called
exponent right if you put exponent on
any number you can't imagine the the
grow rate at which the number go we only
talk about geometric progression but
think about what kind of progression it
will happen depending upon what kind of
education have you gone through so been
a big big proponent that the the only
thing that makes a huge difference in
someone's life is access to Great
education and being part of a great
company wonderful and actually you know
Krishna this is also a good point for me
to ask you you know some of the Learners
that come to Simply learn have similar
stories by the way and just for the
audience uh we have a lot of Learners
Who Come From underprivileged You Know
Places families and backgrounds and
there are a lot of great inspirational
stories that we see with these Learners
as well which mirror some of the things
that Krishna has talked about Krishna
what do you hear from some of these
Learners what are some of the stories
you were able to share with audience so
an we see lot of like distinct pattern
when it comes to learner say many time
people sign up a course because they
somebody told them to sign up for a
course or they heard about some story in
their office or in their family that
somebody did something something good
happen with them and when they sign up
for the course they they sign up
complete the program but what I have
seen consistently is that the Learners
who have performed the best in our
entire cohort and we for to do so many
different cohorts had the hardest life
either like we have seen a lot of
examples of women who have taken career
break and they have to take care of
their family extended family and still
they and still they end end up
completing a program and getting a lot
of success or we have seen people with a
small babies where they have to like
balance their personal professional and
also take care of a small baby you can't
even communicate get what he or she
wants still they end up completing the
program successfully and and come out
with the flying color so I seen that I
think whever we have seen there's a high
degree of commitment and high degree of
desire to become successful and
differentiate yourself people have end
up becoming very successful where
there's a feeling of entitlement that
okay I have paid money I have taken the
program now it's not my problem it
doesn't work that way at the end of the
day you are the one who are who has to
consume that curriculum our role can
only be an enabler that you are getting
stuck somewhere will help you we'll
guide you step by step if you fall
behind on any step we are okay to
restart the step but final hard work is
up to you and the knowledge that you
derve also remains with you I remember
you know in the early days when I joined
simply learn there was one case study
that or one one testimonial that I that
i' had seen of a lady in the US Krishna
that was homeless in a car and jobless
as well right and I remember that she
had said that she managed to somehow
make money to take a project management
program
and it was a game changer life changer
and 6 months later she had a job
$100,000 salary and remember her email
to Simply learn which was absolutely
astounding the kind of inspiration that
we could derive from that I think those
are the kind of St I remember that lady
story because I had spoken to her also
and there was another angle to her story
also that she had become mom at the age
of 16 and of course she had to go she
had to fend herself and she was out of
family and really really tough life and
after completing this course one of her
last Finishing Line was of that long
email was that she could see the uh
sense of pride in her son looking at her
mom that now my mom is doing a
respectable job so I think that was also
I'm sure must both of them must have
felt great about this whole experience
which is really the power of education
for you right um so moving on a little
bit Krishna in back back to your life
right I think we now mve to your college
life and that's where you and I actually
met for the first time I think um for
the audience's sake Krishna and I knew
each other but we weren't necessarily
the best of friends so I want to be very
candid about that we were in different
departments and different parts of the
hostel as well um and I remember some
very distinct things about you Krishna
at that time one is um quite seriously
you a very big debater you loved
arguments um and sometimes for the sake
of arguing so that was something I
remember very well I remember you were
very driven uh you were the first person
who said I'm going to be the president
of the college for the student Committee
of course and typically in any college
typically the locals typically take that
position right um but you did it you
made it happen and you started by
becoming the class representative and
then gradually becoming the president
for the college right so I think I have
some distinct memories which I remember
you were very different from the rest
but I would love to hear your story of
the college and what you thought you
accomplished there and how your
experience in college shaped again what
you've done after that so I had a a
great time at College I think that
that's that that was the best part of my
life so far I and I I tell that very
proudly so here is what happened with me
so I was always a very good student I
was a Topper of be board also which is
very difficult thing to do because when
I wrote my 10th board exam there there
are about 6.67 lakhs people who had
written board exam so it was really
really tough thing because I was really
very studious and very very academically
focused so but when I was going to
college my father told me uh in fact my
father gave me a great advice he said
that see you are a good student if you
go to the college if you continue the
way you are continuing you might end end
up getting 90 95% and become engineer
but fast forward few years out of
college nobody going to is going to ask
whether you became an engineer with 95%
marks or 70% marks so just do everything
else other than studies and actually I
took it that was the the best I'll say
advice ever that I got and actually I
stick to it so I found frankly very easy
for me because getting 70% was like a
kick walk I never had to in fact I was
so consistent the first semester to my
sixth semester my marks were
consistently 71.2 to 71.6 very very
precise so so so with that being the
case I had a lot of time to try out
various things so I think that gave me
um uh very good experience I must say I
tried Sports I tried little bit of
student politics or whatever did lot of
friendship so I think that has really
helped me transform myself because I had
you know I had lot of time other than
the studies to think about what's
happening around me yeah but I want to
deep da a little bit on the student
politics side I'm sure there are some
Leadership Lessons you've already also
got from that experience um can you talk
a little bit about that experience so
first I want to want to answer this
point on being like um arguing for the
sake of arguing see my always has been I
remember one of the earliest debate in
my school that I had participated where
the topic was that population is a bin
for the country and I went and debated
very hard that human being with brain
with heart with real life how can they
be a problem they cannot be a problem
and uh
and of course I own the debate because I
had a lot of points related to that that
the challenge is that this human being
who is not got access to resources is
maybe a ban to the society but imagine
how can human being be a burden so so so
I I always had contrary view but yeah on
the student politics um what I learned
is the same thing that has that is like
has been consistent with my strong
belief that if you focus on something
and you put the right kind of effort
everything works like I know one of my
good friend was C har right you know you
also know CV were same school so when
this election count voting count was
happening everybody was sitting and he
was sitting next to me CV and when the
teacher suum David was our professor and
she was the counting returning officer
what we call in elections she was the
one who was counting the vot so we saw
that she had kept two like piece of
paper one was like this and other
started going started going like this so
s sitting next to me and saying that you
you are going to lose by huge huge
margin he was my closest friend in
school at that point of time but what
turned out to be that this was my my and
then he wasn't surprised that how did
this happen as the consistent effort so
we in this entire process I never took
anything for granted just because I'm
contesting election I have good friends
they are going to like really vote for
me I really mapped my entire audience
went to everyone one by one and I had
reasons for them to believe that if you
vote for me what do you get how does it
going to help you so the entire exercise
I did and the result became that okay my
the a guy who was like against me maybe
he took it for granted that he had done
a great job last year so automatically
he will win this this year also but then
since in my oneon-one convincing I had
mapped everyone everyone's interest
everyone desire everyone's expectation
from that particular role it worked out
to me the learning has been don't take
things for granted you might be great
but still you have to go and put effort
if you want to achieve something and I
think Krishna you bring up a very
important point I think some great
person said it's not the will to win but
the will to prepare to win that
differentiates people I think you know
big lesson out of that that experience
there thank you Krishna for sharing that
so you finished College you got your
71.2% you got it exactly right you left
College you joined your first job
Krishna honestly when you left you know
the college and you joined a big company
I always figured it was a very big
Misfit um and but you still joined a big
company and then you did it for a while
and there were some experiences you had
there which then shaped your next
chapter love to hear the story of that
that chapter from the college I didn't
go and join a big company in I'll tell
you something else also happened sure so
when I was in college from 1 to sixth
semester getting 71.2 to6 consistent
performance was great but when it came
time for campus I was not eligible to
sit on campus because most of the good
companies at least so-called good
companies had 75% as a cut off so I that
was a big cultural I'll not say cultural
shock it was a big shock that I was I I
have never I was never used to not being
eligible for something because I had
less marks so I was I got really very
upset and and and I don't know kind of
agitated with myself that how can
something like this happen to me so not
everybody knows but uh 7th semester and
e8th semester both the semester
consistently scored 86 and 88% that
nobody believes and I told some of our
classmat it can't happen I showed them
my marks so that also reminded me that
okay I was getting this because I was
not putting the effort there was a
conscious choice but when I got that
shock I did put the effort and I really
got that kind of Mark so so and that
also and during that time when I was in
the final year I think everybody started
becoming a little bit serious about what
they wanted to do in life so what I did
was that most biharis they want to
become is Officer I always wanted to
become an is Officer so I thought that
okay the best place for me to do that is
to go to an i where everybody prepares
for that and start preparing so that led
me to I khur I wrote gate exam and went
to I khur for doing mtech as an parking
lot because you get free hostel and you
get stien also if you do mtech but you
go and prepare for is that was my goal
but two weeks into I khur I realized
that this is not a place that I can
survive this is not a subject that I
want that I really like I I got into
micro Electronics which was the hottest
topic so only when you score very high
you get micro electronics and itur was
the only place that time where there was
a full fles Cadence lab Cadence
softwares are very costly but they had
the full Lab but as soon I realized this
is not something that I want to do in
fact one of our current Partners
Professor s Goan was the trip director
he was the H of electrical engineering
that that time at I khur but within that
15 days period also I had built a
relationship with him that time also but
then I realized that this is a course
that I don't want to do and I decided to
like um drop off and after that then I I
joined enforces because of ences pro
teachers they were hiring anyone and
everyone during those times and what was
your experience there obviously you know
that by the way infosis V Pro great
companies they do some amazing work um
but of course there's a certain mindset
that you had which may not have fit
there really well so talk to us about
that tell us more about what happened
there and how did the entrepreneurship
journey start so when I went to when I
joined infosis that was in September
1999 you completed a training program
and they had a very good Training
Program I think that was the best
training program I think that I can
think of of somebody who doesn't know
how to code how to program and they had
everything covered so that gave me a
good background but after the training
period was over there was there was no
work literally there was no work and
because uh the business model of all
these companies during that n late '90s
and early 200 was that they always had
almost 30 to 40% people on bench waiting
for project and as soon as a project
comes you get deployed fortunately or
unfortunately I never got deployed on a
project so I was always like rooming
around without any work so I got bored
so I went to my boss and I told him K I
don't have any work give me at least
some work he said that ke there is no
work in India but you can go to us so
actually this discussion happened on
Friday next Friday I was in us cuz that
time the Visa and all also used to
happen very fast then I went to us I
went to Boston um through infosis for a
project the day I landed in the office
of that particular company it was like
it was 2 September 2000 um I landed uh I
think on the weekend in us and Monday
onwards I was supposed to start on the
project the Monday the first thing that
enosis got to know and we also got to
know that the project is crap then they
tried putting me another project with
the same customer that project also
never happened and one month down the
line that company itself got closed down
so there was this company called EC
cubed which was they're building some
components for B2B Commerce and it was a
startup like typical uh like kind of
startup but the startup got busted so I
came back to India and then I left in
forces I there was all this year like
almost like 13 14 months in the in there
was no project no no project at all so
when I left in forces I started thinking
about what what can I do next so I
started networking with my school
friends some of them had gone to
different colleges one of my friend had
gone to I kpur so I started talking to
him and I realized that he was exactly
in in same boat as me he he was was with
IBM and IBM also there was hardly any
work so and he was already thinking
about in fact he was also doing
something already that why don't we we
do something of Our Own in fact he had
already started doing something of his
own uh before me and I also joined him
and that became our first company te
unified and soon two other guys also
joined so four of us uh with average one
year of so-called it experience but no
real experience started our first
company called take unified and as and
it was like 2 200 Market was like 2021
alltime great everybody thought that
this is the this is how the world is
going to remain always but unfortunately
that continued for a short period of
time 91 happened and the world became
stand still so we are here four of us no
money no experience and we're trying to
build a company but what worked for us
was that we stayed together we never
give
up 2002 and 2003 was cruel right there
was we we had no work we had we don't
know what to do I don't know how we
survived but somehow we survived and
that also helped us learn that if you
want to build something you need to have
this thing called perseverance don't
give up you'll always get tough time
become each other's strength and then
you can sell through eventually Tech
unified that was the name of my previous
startup started in 2000 we ended up
selling that company in 2007 February to
a listed company called War informatics
which was which was started by bam SAR
and that and with almost no Capital uh
this that was a 49 CR transaction at
that point of time we had no investors
no nobody so pretty much starting from
scratch to becoming like all of us
became multi dollar millionar and I
think at that 2007 I think average years
of all four of us was maybe 28 29 year
so it was a good outcome that we created
um by taking the risk at that point of
time and just being persistent
perseverance and all this good things
that you hear about and I think you said
one thing which I think is really really
important right I think you you took a
risk in a time where a lot of people may
not have taken a risk which I think is
really really important but you took the
risk and you stayed with that risk for a
long time and you wanted to make it work
and I think that is so important for I
think our audience to also understand
that that's one of the key formulas to
any kind of success actually so I think
that's a really important point so
Krishna you finished Tech unified you
you exited had a successful exit um
where did then simply learn and E Tech
and you know education as an idea come
in your mind and why education what's
the whole story there s I'll tell you in
my technified experience see our biggest
business used to be in Saudi Arabia out
of all the places if you think about
2002 2003 2004 time most of the people
of our age and those who have gone to I
and it they wanted to go to us and
Europe nobody wanted to go to Saudi
Arabia but within that also we took a
risk that okay let's go to Saudi Arabia
that sounded like quite scary but we
went there and we found that they had
Banks and banks are always very Tech
driven so we got an opportunity to get
exposed to complex system that otherwise
you would not have got an opportunity
that provided us a lot of learning and
that gave us success also because we
could figure out um how to like navigate
this uh Saudi corporate and and banking
system and and and grow in there so when
we sold Tech unified in 2007 and we're
trying to figure it out what do I do we
do next what I realized that four of us
started to unifight together so all four
of us four of us engineering graduate
from 99 batch same profile if you look
at on paper someone walked I was with
infosis for some for before that two of
us two of them were with vpro one was
with IBM similar kind of background but
in this 7year journey everybody figured
figured out their own Niche so we we
never divided work formally saying that
you do this you do that you do that but
eventually we all settled in our own
territory so someone started focusing on
sales someone started focusing on
product and take somebody started
focusing focusing on like um marketing
and I was responsible for delivery so I
used to take care of all the like when
whenever we used to win any contract
making sure that we deliver the product
successfully consistently and so on so
one challenge that I had was that most
of my customers were in Saudi Arabia and
that region and later we also got into
Africa so Kenya Tania Uganda one of my
toughest challenge used to be like
sending people to go to those locations
for deployment
because a bank in in any of these reason
is very complex they don't allow anybody
to touch unless they are confident that
the person knows the stuff so my
challenge was how do I hire train deploy
s good people in countries where
majority people don't want to go so
hiring training became a big part of my
job naturally in uh in in teifi so when
I was coming out of teifi I was trying
to figure it out that what can I do so
in the process what I realized was that
teifi business was B2B we had banking
product customer connect that you used
to sell to uh Banks but a lot of people
started talking about internet as being
the next big thing in 2007 2008 and
actually it became pretty big over a
period of time so I thought that why not
first learn internet then you can get
ideas on what you can do on the internet
so that thought I started simply learn
as a Blog in 2009 to start blogging
because I I love writing so you can
write on your own blog and in the
process you can also learn how an
Internet site works so that's where the
first time I heard about SEO first time
I heard about analytics that there's
this tool called Google analytics that
you can put on the site and it shows you
who has come from where they have come
and so on so initial interest was to
learn but this blog became popular
because I was like I had already left te
unified and I had all the time to keep
writing so I kept writing I also started
recording and doing a lot of classes in
fact some of my free classes on PMP I
remember in 2009 and and early 2010 I
used to have 500 and 600 people logging
into my class for 1 hour doubt
clarification class that I used to do
but it was all free there was nothing
paid and then that gave me the idea that
okay there are so many people are coming
to on my website for uh getting free
advice if I pay put a paid button some
of them will pay that's where I I copy
pasted PayPal that script and put it on
my website and I think I did that on
Saturday evening and Sunday morning when
I woke up I had seven payments so then
the model was proven so so that became
the starting of uh simply learn as a as
a company that we know wonderful so
Krishna maybe in some sense to simplify
what you've done you know you you've
taken a lot of risk uh at a time when
you were doing a corporate job and you
know sometimes you know not doing
something productive allows you to think
about other things and take risks is
that maybe oversimplification of your
journey or what would you say so I first
want to like comment on your this
corporate job I'll say that for one year
or so that I I was employed with infosis
I only took corporate salary but I any
job because I had no job right in fact
that was the starting point of my
entrepreneural journey because I used to
go to infosis every day go to go have
free dinner because they used to offer
free dinner after 8:00 I used to go to
gym again enjoy their gym because I had
no work go to their free internet go to
their library but hardly any work and
then after doing this for a long period
of time I really got bored and that's
where I started talking to my school
friends who had gone to different
colleges and they had gone to different
companies to figure it out on are they
doing manying job are they doing
something that I'm not aware of and and
in the process I realized that many of
them were exact similar boat as me
because all of them were so-called bench
in their respective companies and that
became the starting of my first
entrepreneur Journey so it gave me time
to think about on if your company is not
making best of you what else can you do
so my first Venture was not a well
thought out Venture it was just to do
something meaningful when you look at
simply Lear the story also it was not a
very again well thought out Venture that
okay now I I want to move from B2B sales
company like that I take unified was to
an education platform it also happened
by chance because it was a Blog that I
was running to learn internet and then
it clicked and it became an online
online platform that we know today so it
all happened in the flow of work right
so Krishna I think the big takeaway for
our audience is too much of doing
nothing can lead to great things if
you're willing to take the risk and
persist that's the important takeaway
Krishna do you run into this challenge
of doing nothing at work these days or
what's what does your day look like you
know these days so an this great point
so so from there on to now of course we
have grown in size we have grown in
number of customers and so is associated
challenges with our business different
product lines different countries but uh
that core thought that we need to always
challenge status quo and not become
comfortable if you're in comfortable
scenario has a stays with me right like
one of the thing that you already know
that I'm in in the process of making a
change that when we when when our us
business increased we also acquired a
large company and we have large number
of team members in US my morning times
started becoming free and my evening
started becoming very very tough because
of so much interaction that I had with
the US time Jun and very well settled in
India because of being in Bangalore for
so many years very very strong ecosystem
in for my all extended families all are
all maybe 1 kilometer away from my house
great support system at home kids in
school but at this point of time I'm
making this decision that okay a large
part of my team is best in us and I'm
busy more during the US time why should
I be best in Bangalore I should rather
be best there now it's a big change in
fact I to to me it's a even bigger
challenge than the challenge that I saw
maybe 15 years back when I started my
first venture out of boredom of not
having work I'm it's a it's a difficult
change if if you are used to stay in
India for 20 years where we have every
kind of support available people are
ready to help to a country like us where
whoever you are you might be a
multi-billionaire but you can't take
things for granted there are some work
that you have to do at home there are
some household responsibility that you
have to fulfill is is a major major
change but I'm up for up for a challenge
and hoping that it turns out to be good
wonderful so I think for the next
podcast which hopefully with Krishna
will have soon we'll be talking about
the things he does at home once he's in
the US right and most likely from us
absolutely so so Krishna you've been in
E Tech and education for give or take 10
plus years you've seen a lot of Trends
emerge disappear happen right what are
your thoughts on the key trends that
will continue in attech what are the key
things that you think are going to
happen in the next few years predictions
yeah so an first when you talk about
ettech since we are in this a part of
tech we we variably think about our part
but Tech is a pretty large industry
right there is like what we call K12
like helping Learners find providing
value to Learners over what whatever
they learn in school then we have test
prep helping people get crack various
kinds of exams and we have lot different
kinds of exam in India there are Global
exams like act and GMAT and then there
is like it tech companies who are very
focused on helping Learners get their
first job and then there is a lifelong
learning uh where we where large part of
our programs CER to and then we also
have higher education so it's a pretty
wide spectrum so in last 10 years one
thing that I have noticed is that um all
these players have some kind of content
right either they generate content or
procure content or now with Gen a you
can create a lot of content in automated
manner but I don't think Learners sign
up for any of the programs because they
want access to content because I
strongly believe that the best content
is available on YouTube you just need to
find which that which of those all this
content universe that YouTube has which
is the best content so why would learner
come to an any any tech company simply
learner or for that matter anyone else I
think the come to they go and sign up to
an Tech platform for their promise for
the experience that okay I'm signing up
with this company because I expect why
as an outcome that they have
consistently consistently spoken about
so I think experience is what company
should focus on and this experience can
be delivered in various ways like like
some companies who are into deep tech
training they they do this via
combination of instructor engagement
projects Hands-On lab where you can go
and go and
complete your assignment you get the gr
the assignment give them feedback and so
on that's one way of like providing
engagement other way of providing
engagement is that lot of if you look at
higher edate company what do they is
that not only you get access to
curriculum from the great professors you
also create cohort and go and join and
learn together in a group from a where
the where the professor or the
facilitator facilitates discussion and
so on so end of the day the experience
and outcome is what going to be really
important and Learners are going to pay
for that and of course from time to time
we will have disruptive technology like
gen geni coming and creating new
dimension like for example content has
become even bigger commodity because it
can be generated at a scale through a
technology like gen absolutely so I
think you know in line with that as well
you know this is also a good time for
entrepreneurs there are a lot of
entrepreneurs thinking should I do the
same you know should I take the same
risk that Krishna took many many years
back for these sort of budding
entrepreneurs or the ones who are yet to
be entrepreneurs what ADV would you give
them so this is an advice that I have
consistently given to people who want to
become an entrepreneur both online and
offline is that you should not become an
entrepreneur because you see a lot of
people becoming entrepreneur lot of
entrepreneurs becoming popular because
you only hear about people who have got
somewhat success you don't hear about a
lot of people who have not become
successful so this entire journey is
very I'll say it's a very tough Journey
not everybody come become successful
people who become successful are are
inherently interested in what they're
doing so whether they get success or not
they would have still done the same
thing so if you really feel very
passionate about a topic that you think
that just by working on that in that
particular problem or in that particular
area you might get a lot of satisfaction
end of the day you had a tough time but
you walked on something that that you
inherently like you'll feel good at the
end of the day if the answer is yes then
you should just go ahead and become an
entreer don't worry about anything don't
worry about the trend don't worry about
the market don't worry whether whether
somebody will join your startup or not
don't worry somebody will fund or not
because if you are so so interested in
that particular problem statement and
and the the kind of work that you want
to do everything will fall in place but
if you want to become an entrepreneur
because it's a trend my like initial
like top of the Mind recall is that it's
very difficult to become successful
catching a trend and and trying to ride
on their particular Trend so Krishna I
think you know by any measure of it I
think a lot of people will say that
you've been very successful in your life
the most important question is do your
parents think you're successful
uccessful in life so what would you say
to that yeah so the two- part answer
I'll break parents into my dad and my
mom so I think every mother thinks that
their son is successful whoever you are
so I think let's keep that aside for my
father I think he would have loved me to
become an is Officer because in in when
it comes to bihar's career-wise either
you are an is Officer or you are
everybody else so now I'm not an is
Officer so I'm in that everybody else
category so frankly my father if I go to
he will still say that you should have
written upsc exam and become an ni
officer what is that you're doing so
there you you could be a very successful
entrepreneur still not make a parents
happy keep that in mind that's a big
lesson learned for them um beari parents
for beari parents especially uh Krishna
another question is you know frankly
something I struggle with myself
sometimes right and for most
entrepreneurs or leaders out there so
much to be done so much to be
accomplished tomorrow has to be better
than yesterday as you your have said how
do you keep things grounded how do you
keep things sane what do you do outside
of work how do you keep things together
so an it's a great point and I'm sure
you also go through this challenge any
senior executive goes through that
challenge see couple of things has
worked for me and I and I try to become
better at that one I'm always like very
very disciplined when it comes to my
personal life whoever I am and I've have
seen that you doing you doing that also
whether I'm traveling whether I'm like
in a day-to-day work whether I'm on a
vacation I ensure that I I spend about
an hour on physical exercise either
playing or swimming or or going to a gym
is absolute must because that gives you
a lot of energy so so that makes my like
physical state in in a good place
absolutely it's non-negotiable there's
like nothing can stop me doing that at
least five days a
week every week so so that's that's one
thing that has that has helped me a lot
second once you are used to this
stressful time over time you you figure
out a mechanism so one of the mechanism
that I figured out is that everything
every every problem has a solution so
maybe as soon as you hear about a big
problem initially you get very agitated
you get sad you go through a lot of
emotion but once you accept this fact
that it's part of life then you start
immediately thinking about okay now that
this has happened what next what are the
options that I have and start um
following that option I'm also very
spiritual in fact as a family we are
very spiritual and a big believer of
Gita that the only thing that is in your
control is
effort the results are not in your
control and and again a very big
believer of that that you put your best
foot forward you put your best effort
with the best intention but don't bother
about the results whatever results has
come because of various reasons that's
what the result you deserved and again
put your next best effort next time so
that has really helped me a lot and
every time I get into a scenario on
something that is that has happened to
me which is very very unexpect
unexpectedly bad I remind myself again
of the same thing that I put my best
effort maybe next time if I put into the
same scenario I I'll take this learning
and put Even Better Effort but I'll not
bother about the result thank you
Krishna for that wisdom and so many
pieces of nuggets of advice that you
shared I'm sure our audience is really
lapping it all up and getting the value
that you're providing I think uh for the
audience I want to just share that if
any of you had a great anecdote of
making your bihari parents happy about
your successes we'd love to hear about
it so please let us know um obviously
Krishna was unable to do that in spite
of all of his achievements so love to
hear stories from you all um audience
I'd like to thank you for being here
Krishna thank you so much for being here
today and sharing your stories and
life's lessons for all of us thank you
Anand we speak every day on various
topic but it was a different kind of
conversations really loved it thank you
um this series continues further with
some conversations with industry experts
learner experiences we also work with
universities and partners we'll have a
lot of stories from them in terms of
success stories there so stay tuned for
future episodes of as simple as that
thank
you

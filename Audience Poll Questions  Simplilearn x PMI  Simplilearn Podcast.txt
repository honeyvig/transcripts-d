somebody has asked um what is the worst
advice you have given someone worst
advice yeah you have given it to someone
[Laughter]
ah I don't know they would not tell
me maybe something that you thought that
okay it was an O advice right I don't
know okay I would have to think about
that and post it on
LinkedIn and the next question is that
um what is the of your name so I think
my first name Pier is a is a a Catholic
name right it's the first U Apostle of
Jesus my my mom is Catholic I was raised
as a Catholic my last name sounds very
French but it's not it's Vietnamese so
Vietnamese names are usually in three
parts I kept two parts of my dad's name
um the first two Le man um Le is a
dynasty so in Vietnam many people have
the same name as a dynasty like muen
like Le Chen whatever um and then mine
is just a second name like a you can ask
Vietnamese people what it actually means
they have different interpretation of it
so I'm not going to comment to it
there's also a very interesting question
somebody has asked that if you are left
with a smartphone and less than
$1,000 and you have to survive what will
you do what profession what what work
will you do to
survive um the first thing I would do is
to try and find a job good any job to be
able to survive the time I figure out
what to do next that's a great point and
then there's another question from
somebody in aeran saying that it's an
emerging market and what is PMI doing to
support project managers in in such
Market which might not be on the main
map for PMI but still there are people
like him or her working or want to work
in project management as a profession
what kind of resour you do have chapters
in over 200 countries and aeran like any
other country you know we we have a few
restrictions in countries that
are uh blacklisted by the US government
it's a little complicated for us to
operate there but apart from that uh we
have no restrictions so aan of course
you know should be part of our plans

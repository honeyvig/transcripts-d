hey everyone this is harsh bhardwaj and
welcome back to another video by simply
learn
and in this video we'll learn about c
plus visual studio and how can we
perform some programs in visual studio
now visual studio is an ide that is an
integrated development environment from
microsoft
used for developing computer programs
web apps websites etc
it includes compilers code completion
tools graphical designers and many more
tools which helps in software
development
it is one of the best code editors for
developers and designers
so without further ado
let's begin
so the first thing we need to do is to
download visual studio from its official
website
so we will search visual studio on
google
we'll
search visual studio
now we can open any of these two links
we'll click on the second
one so this is the official website of
visual studio
and now we can click on this download
for windows button which is blue in
color
so when we'll click on it
the computer will ask if to download it
or not so we'll click on download now
now the downloading is start
so it will take a while the size of the
file is 76.2 mb
the download is almost done
and the download is complete now we'll
click on this open folder
it will open the folder where the setup
is
here it
is visual studio code user setup
so now we have downloaded the visual
studio now we have to install this so
we'll click on this
so this is the license agreement we will
accept the agreement and we'll click on
next
and now we can change the destination
folder if you want but
it is not necessary and make sure that
294.3 mb of free space is there in this
destination folder
okay now we'll click on next
and now again we can click on next
we don't need to change this one also
now these are some additional tasks you
can check any of them as per your choice
i'll click on these
and now we'll click on
next
now there is an install button now we'll
click on this install
and the installation begins
and installation is done
and here we can check this launch visual
studio it is already checked and when
will click on this finish
the visual studio will launch
so this is our visual studio code this
is how it look likes
so
in this top left side
this is the activity bar which lets you
switch between views
and this is the status bar which tells
you
this one is the status bar which tells
you
about the open projects and files you
edited
and this is the editor where you write
codes first of all we'll click on new
file so now this is the editor where you
write codes and edit files etc you can
open as many editors as you want
and
this is the explorer
which is used to open manage all files
and folders in your project you can
create delete rename and move the files
etc and you can start immediately by
opening a file or folder in via studio
then
this is search search provides the
global search across open folder
all right now this is source control
source control includes git source
control by default
run and debug displays call stacks and
break points then this is the extension
extensions we can add extensions by
installing them within the vs code
and
if we want to do a program of c plus
then we have to configure the visual
studio code
and for that first of all we'll click on
these extensions
and now we'll search for
code runner
this is the one we will click on that
and now to add the extension we will
click on this install button
and it is installed
now as we have installed this extension
so let's
do
install another extension that is c
c plus plus
here it is
so this extension is by microsoft so
we'll click on this install button
and it is installed
as you can see downloading c c plus
language components so
it is in the process
and it's done uh this extension will
help us in debugging and code browsing
so now we can start with our c plus plus
program
let's close this
and this as well
all right now we can start with our c
plus plus program so first of all we'll
create a new file
we can create it by going to this file
and now
to the new file
and that's how we have created the file
so i have showed you how to create the
file now we can save the file by going
to file again
and
save as
now we can set the location
so let's name this file now
let's say
calc
dot cpp
because we are going to do a calculator
program
so let's start
first of all
we'll write hash include stream
which is the header file
now
we'll write using namespace standard
which is the namespace standard
after that
we'll start with int main
and inside the int main we'll declare
the variables
first of all we'll declare a variable of
type character and its name will be sim
that is symbol
then we'll
declare two variables n1
and two
let's make them float because
the numbers can be of decimal form
so we'll declare them of float data type
all right
now we'll display a message
we'll display enter the symbol of the
operation that you want to perform
because we are doing
the calculator program so that is why we
have to ask the user to enter the symbol
of addition subtraction or whatever the
operation he or she want to do
so
we'll start
enter
the symbol
of the operator
that you want
the operation
that you want to perform
all right now we'll take the input of
the symbol
so we have declared sym
symbol
now all we have to do
is to take the input of the operators or
numbers
so we'll display a message
please enter the numbers
and now we'll take the input of numbers
and one
and two
now
we'll use switch statement
and inside the switch statement we'll
put a condition
that is our variable sim and whichever
case
of the switch case matches with that
same variable
that particular case will execute
so we'll write
sym
the name of the variable same
and now we'll create the cases
so the first case would be
plus
if the same variable is plus
symbol
then
then we want to print the addition of
those two numbers
so let's do that
first of all
in order to make it look good
we'll write like this
n2
now
we'll simply add
those two variables
all right this is the case one
now case two would be subtraction
we put the minus sign
all right
now we'll do the same for this one
n1
subtraction symbol
we are writing like this because we want
to
we want the output to look good
it's your choice
now we'll write n1 minus n2
now case 3 would be
multiplication
and one variable
multiplication sign
and to variable
equals sign
now
n1 multiply by n2
the last case would be
division
so n1
division sign
n2
equal sign
semicolon
and now we will divide n1 and n2
we forgot to do one thing guys
to write the break statement after each
case it will end the case
after its execution
we'll write break
with the semicolon
all right now
return 0
now i'll explain this part one more time
this sim is the symbol that is entered
by the user that is the operation which
user wants to perform
and whichever symbol matches this
sim
like
if it is
addition subtraction multiplication or
division which so ever symbol matches
with the sim
that particular case will execute
like if the user have entered the symbol
of subtraction then this case will
execute
and if the user have entered the
division symbol then this case will
execute
we forgot to
do this over here
that is right by showing the error
and over here as well
so yeah so this is how we can write the
program of calculator so now let's try
to run this one
okay so first of all before running this
program we have to save the file we'll
go to file
click on save
and it will get saved
you can do this by pressing ctrl ns at
the same time as well
all right now we'll try to run this
program by clicking on this play button
we have clicked the button
all right i got the error
so we did something wrong we have used
double quotes
let's make it single quotes and
now save it again by pressing ctrl ns at
the same time
now let's try to run this once more time
here we can see enter the symbol that
you want to
perform
all right now let's try to enter the
symbol
i am trying to enter the symbol but it
is not taking any input
so this is a problem which can be solved
by
going to the file and now going to the
preference selecting the preference now
we'll click on settings
now over here in the settings
we'll write
run in
terminal
now we'll scroll a little
and here we can see code runner run in
terminal
so we'll tick this one
and now
we can cross it
and
now we'll save this one by pressing ctrl
n s and we'll close the
vs code editor
all right
now
we'll again open the code editor
now again we'll try to run this one
so
let's click on this run button
here we can see enter the symbol of the
operation that you want to perform
so let's say i want to do addition so
we'll click on the edition symbol here
we can see we can enter now as we have
done the changes and we have closed the
via studio once and again open it so the
changes are made
now we have entered the plus symbol
now we have to please enter the numbers
so we'll enter the numbers let's say
10
plus 76
as you can see 10 plus 76 equals 86
now
let's try another one
now i want to do
a multiplication
over here
multiplication symbol
please enter the numbers let's say
5
into
20
which is equals 200 this is also correct
so this was an example of a calculator
program that we have developed in visual
studio code and it is pretty easy to
develop and
create project in visual studio code you
can try some other languages on visual
studio code as well
so this is the way how we can download
install and configure in visual studio
and do programming with these
so that's it for the tutorial i hope you
got the idea about c
visual studio thanks for watching stay
safe and keep learning

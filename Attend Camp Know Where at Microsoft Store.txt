Welcome to Camp Know Where
it's got fun,
learning,
and more.
Hi, I'm Suzie. The camp's number one fan.
Camp Know Where is a technology camp.
We learn to build radios, robots, make movies,
even code arcade games.
And they partnered with Microsoft so they have the new Windows 1.11.
You'll make new friends, have new adventures,
sing some songs - right Dusty Bun?
And who knows, you might even save the world.

understand the importance of business
analy with a S and interesting story so
meet Rob he runs a cafe in a small town
far away his Cafe is one of the oldest
and most popular eateries in town Rob's
Cafe was hugely popular amongst
customers and it was doing very well
until the onset of the deadly Corona
virus due to covid-19 like other EES Rob
was forced to sh down his Cafe too this
took a heavy toll on his business and
subsequently he lost his customers none
of his customers visited his Cafe and
this resulted in a huge loss for him he
knew he couldn't afford to close his
business forever as it would take time
for Corona virus to be eradicated but he
was lost this situation was new to him
and he didn't know how to reopen his
business amidst this pandemic after a
lot of brainstorming he recollected
reading about business analysts he
remembered that business analysts are
professionals who enable a change in an
organization he felt like a business
analyst could help him sort out his
current business problems hence without
wasting any time he set out to hire a
business analyst he hired Ted the
business analyst to help him with his
ongoing business problems Rob entrusted
Ted with reopening the business the
first step Ted took was to have a
discussion with Rob and understand the
business problems and the
objectives that is ideally the first
step a business analyst would take on
discussing with Rob Ted learned that the
business objective was to reopen the
business and get at least 80% of the
customer base back in addition to that
Rob also wanted Ted to look for
sustainable ways to reopen and continue
the business in the long run amidst the
pandemic Ted studied the case and he
came up with a few suggestions that he
thought was fit for Rob's business
his first suggestion was to develop an
exclusive home delivery app for Rob's
Cafe this way Ted knew that business
will improve as customers prefer home
delivery in the current scenario next
Ted suggested that Rob has work from
home meal boxes added to his
menu many professionals are working from
home currently and having work from home
meal boxes would be a good pick for such
Professionals in the middle of a busy
day Ted's third suggestion was to bring
down the cost by providing discount
coupons that can be utilized by
customers having a discount will enable
more customers to order from Rob's Cafe
of course it was not possible to get the
customer base back without any short of
price Cuts in the current situation
finally Ted suggested that Rob's staff
would facilitate home delivery orders
this way he didn't have to lay off his
staff and at the same time get the home
delivery running so these were a few
suggestions given by Ted yes depending
on the situation ation business analysts
can take up different approaches so
after the suggestions were accepted by
Rob for the app TED began to make sure
that the development went well by
collaborating with the IT team Ted
became the intermediary between the IT
team and Rob he provided suggestions to
the team checked the app through user
interface testing and made sure that the
requirements met well the same applied
to the other business requirements and
changes as well Ted held regular
meetings to gaze the progress and also
kept Rob in the loop and updated him
with the status of the project attending
regular catch-ups helped Rob gain an
insight into the progress and give his
feedback from time to time Ted made sure
that the entire case was well documented
by doing so he could always refer to the
documents in the future with similar
cases as well Ted made presentations
that showed Rob the business growth
after implementing the changes and Ted
always supported his presentations with
data Rob was very impressed with Ted's
business approach such an approach not
only helped Rob reopen his business
amidst the covid-19 but also helped him
get 80% of his customer base back Ted
successfully brought about a positive
change in Rob's business which was
highly beneficial so that is how Ted the
business analyst helped Rob make a
business sustainable this was the
importance of having a business analyst
in Rob's organization don't you think
every organization should have a
business analy well yes depending on the
business domain and the situation the
roles and responsibilities may vary
let's start off and have a look at a day
in the life of a business analyst
through a small story so meet Angela who
is working as a business analyst in an
application development firm her firm
builds applications for clients
depending on their requirements our next
character is Rob he is a butting
entrepreneur with a vision of setting up
his own e-commerce app he plans on
selling several electronic gadgets like
phones laptops cameras Etc on his app so
what is Rob's First Step well he
approaches Angela's firm one day with
the vision of creating his e-commerce
app Angela and Rob start talking
business and Angela promises to help Rob
with his app creation she assures him
that she will look into his business
requirements and coordinate with him to
get the app running Rob is happy about
it and agrees to cooperate with Angela
regarding all the business requirements
from his end Angela as we know is the
business analyst she starts planning
Rob's project and without any delay she
embarks on this Project's Journey she
has a set of of planned steps that will
help her fulfill Rob's
requirements but what are the steps she
takes is her approach going to be
effective and quick let's find out the
answers to these questions now up next
you can learn about Angela's approach
that helps her deliver Rob's project
smoothly and without any hassles these
steps that we are going to look at are
the typical roles and responsibilities
of a business analyst here we will
understand these roles better with
respect to Angela's and drop story first
and foremost Angela Anga understands
Rob's business objectives problems and
requirements without understanding this
do you think Angela will be able to
proceed no hence a business analyst like
Angela understands the problems related
to Rob's business and comes up with the
right solution to achieve the goals of
the business she brainstorms around what
is best sued for an e-commerce app
focusing on electronic Gadgets in The
Next Step Angela gathers all the
necessary requirements here she
understands Rob's requirements and makes
sure that they are on the same page
regarding the project and its goals both
of them together arrive at a stipulated
deadline for the project
completion she gathers relevant
information based on security of the app
the payment setup based to login cost of
the products and style to name a few
once Angela has an in-depth
understanding of Rob's project and
gathers all the necessary requirements
she starts allocating Resources by
keeping in mind the budget of the
project here she recognizes and
allocates tasks and resources to the
development team B work closely with the
development team to design the solution
for a problem Angela ensures that the
development team doesn't spend their
time understanding Rob's requirements in
this step along with the development
team she finalizes the software and
tools required to build the project
Angela doesn't rest until the project is
delivered to Rob she continuously
monitors the progress and constantly
provides her feedback to the development
team with respect to the app's layout
design and other feed features she gives
them suggestions in order to improve the
application in The Next Step Angela
collects feedback of the Prototype
version of the app from the
users she notes down if the Prototype is
fine or if it requires more work PA
validate if the project is running fine
with the help of use acceptance testing
they verify if the solution being worked
on is in line with the requirements and
ensure that the final product satisfies
the use
expectations Bas also assess the
functional and functional requirements
after collecting feedback Angela moves
to one of her most crucial duties and
that is building reports data
visualization is a key skill for any ba
in order to gauge the performance of the
app and get valuable insights from it
Angela builds reports using various data
visualization tools like Tablo powerbi
and click view reports can be General
reports such as detailed reports or it
can be dashboard reports such as
visualized reports with
multi-dimensional analysis based on
display of business indicators it is not
uncommon for issues to crop up amst this
entire process hence Angela conducts
regular meetings with the development
team and Rob to solve problems quickly
having these meetings will help Rob
understand the status of the project and
it will also help the teams proceed in
the right path throughout this project
phase Angela makes sure to maintain
transparency on completion of the
project Angela documents and presents
the project findings to Rob generally
business business analyst present the
project outcomes to the stakeholders and
clients along with maintenance reports
anela notes on all the project learnings
and details in a concise manner this
will help her take better decisions in
the future and these documents will save
her time while implementing the next
project now that she has completed all
her duties and responsibilities with
respect to Rob's project she is ready to
deliver the final e-commerce application
to Rob for use Rob is rest assured that
the application developed by Angela's
firm is apt for his business and just
what he wanted Angela's streamlined
approach made it easier for the project
to be delivered within the stipulated
time period Rob is happy and I'm sure he
will come back to Angela's firm for
projects in the future so those
responsibilities that we saw Angela
carry out are ideally the roles and
responsibilities for any business
analyst out there yes some may vary

and the project you're working on if

combination of technical as well as
non-technical skills often referred to
as soft skills the skills for a business
analyst are not only acquired through
training but through experience and
combined with the ability to understand
situations and the motive behind the
problem so let's have a look at the top
skills to become a successful business
analyst the first skill we have is
understanding the business
objective for a business analyst it is
important to know the goals and
objectives Ives of the business it is
advised that business analysts should
have a good knowledge of the business
operations in his or her
organization a business analyst should
understand the problems related to the
business and come up with the right
solution business analyst should resolve
the problems that have been identified
and not avoid them they work on
individual actions and tasks that will
build towards the achievement of the
goals of the business objectives of the
business can be to expand customer base
in order to increase sales scale of
production so that it is in line with
the revenue growth
improve revenue streams through
increasing pursed product value or
increasing marketing budget according to
the revenue business analyst should have
the Natural Curiosity and determination
to continue learning and figuring out
how things fit together even as business
analysts become managers it is important
to stay in touch with the industry and
its
changes the next important skill a
business analyst would have is
analytical and critical
thinking now there is a famous quote by
Thomas Elva Edition which says
5% of the people think 10% of the people
think they think and the other 85% would
rather die than think business analysts
are paid to think a business analyst
should be able to analyze and interpret
the client's requirements
clearly business analysts require good
focus in order to collect and understand
the needs of the client critical
thinking involves evaluating several
options before arriving at the desired
solution in certain situations a
stakeholder may give a requirement
that's not necessarily tied up to any
business value but rather to their own
increased convenience applying critical
thinking demands not taking all the
statements of the stakeholders for
granted critical thinking allows the
business analyst to distinguish between
requirements that add value to the
business and those that should be given
a low priority a business analyst must
be creative in order to reach stated
goals where resources are limited and
the conditions are non
ideal the third important skill for a
business analyst is communication and
interpersonal skills
understanding and being properly
understood is key to any profession if
you're unable to clearly specify and
communicate requirements to any
stakeholder then you may not fully
understand the requirements yourself
being a business analyst is like being
multilingual you have to speak several
different languages while conveying the
same message business analysts apply
communication skills at every point they
use communication and interpersonal
skills when the project is launched
while Gathering requirements when
collaborating with Stak holders and also
while validating the final
solution listening reading and writing
skills are very critical for a business
analyst this should be capable of
facilitating meetings business analysts
use verbal and written communication to
convey ideas Concepts facts and opinions
to a variety of stakeholders non-verbal
communication skills enable the
effective sending and receiving of
messages but not limited to body
movement posture facial expressions
gestures and eye contact
effective listening allows the business
analyst to accurately understand
information that is being communicated
verbally fourth in our list of skills we
have negotiation and cost benefit
analysis being a successful business
analyst requires working with and
interacting with many
people these people include clients
Business Leaders project team members
project stakeholders vendors private
sector Representatives industry leaders
and so forth
business analysts negotiate at every
turn during the course of a project at
the initial stage of a project
negotiation skills are used to determine
what should be included in the vision of
the project as details emerge
negotiation skills are used by all
parties involved to determine which
requests become requirements and which
requirements have higher priority as the
project progresses negotiation skills
help to determine the functional design
which fulfill the requirements technical
decisions also require negotiation
skills business analysts also perform
cost benefit analysis to conduct an
assessment of the benefits and costs
anticipated in a project when
organizations undertake new projects it
is advisable for business analyst that
they use cost benefit analysis to
establish whether such projects should
be embarked or not business analyst
should be able to achieve a profitable
outcome for your company while finding a
solution for the client that makes them
happy this Balancing Act demands the
ability to influence a mutual solution
and and maintain professional
relationship up next we have our fifth
skill that is decision
making the quality of decisions made by
business analyst is what matters a lot
because it has a direct impact on the
company's business thus it is important
for every business analyst to think from
all aspects before presenting their
decision or
strategy they must be having good
problem solving skills as well business
analysts should have a act to think out
of the box and find a solution to
problems majorly a business analyst
follows five major steps while making a
decision these steps are Define the
problem find and Define the alternative
approaches evaluate the alternative
approaches make the decision based on
these approaches and test and finally
implement the
solution while some may argue that the
technical team is responsible for
Designing the solution the business
analyst Still Remains instrument m al in
ensuring that the design conforms to the
requirements that have been approved now
that we have reached halfway through the
skills I would like to ask all our
viewers to please subscribe to our
Channel and hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update from Simply
learn moving on we have another really
important business analyst skill that is
idea about programming
languages business analysts should have
a good Hands-On programming knowledge
for performing better and faster
analysis of data knowledge of R and
python is highly beneficial business
analysts can help solve complex Problems
by writing efficient codes both R and
python have a vast collection of
libraries and packages for data
manipulation data wrangling data
visualization and data analytics some of
these libraries are numpy pandas deer
tier ggplot and matplot lib in addition
to these it is good to understand
statistical software like SAS and SPSS
using these program ing languages such
as python RN SAS you can analyze and
visualize lastar data sets as well as
create machine learning models for
making future business
predictions the seventh skill in our
list is creation of reports and
dashboards now business analyst should
be proficient in using various business
intelligence tools for creating reports
and
dashboards reports created by business
analyst can be General reports such as
detail report grouped report cross tab
report call colum report query report
data entry report Etc or it can be
dashboard report such as visualized
Report with multi-dimension analysis
based on display of business indicators
dashboard reports are developed by
business analyst to solve business
decision-making problems different from
the tabular interface of the general
report the dashboard report adopts the
canvas-like operation interface
knowledge of Tabo powerbi and click view
are required to make different types of
reports depending on the business
requirements
now the eighth skill in our list of
skills is database and
SQL business analysts often work with
data that is structured in nature hence
to store and process this data they
should have knowledge of relational
databases such as Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle database mySQL database as well
as no SQL
databases also having hands-on
experience with SQL is a must for a
business analyst to access retrieve
manipulate and analyze data
so they should be able to write data
definition and data manipulation
commands such as create update delete
and
insert Microsoft Excel is the ninth
skill in our
list Excel is one of the oldest and most
popular and Powerful analytics and
reporting tool used in the industries
for working with
data business analysts use Excel to
perform various calculations budget
analysis and data analysis to derive
meaningful insights and take decisions

to summarize the data business analysts
can also create different charts and
graphs using Excel to generate Dynamic
reports related to a business problem

create Revenue growth models for new
products based on new customer forecast

a website business analyst can list out
dates and Topics in a spreadsheet when

spreadsheet update it month ly and
create a chart to show how close the
product is to budget across each
category business analyst can calculate
customer discounts based on monthly
purchase volume by product they can even
summarize customer Revenue by product to
find areas where to build strong
customer
relationships and finally in the list of
skills we have documentation and
presentation you could have all the
industry experience in the world but if
it's paired with poor business analyst
practices you could be more of a risk to
the organization than a business analyst
with no industry experience at all a
business analyst must be able to
document their project learnings and
results in a concise and compact form
they should also be confident about
presenting their findings and
conclusions in front of the stakeholders
and clients organized documentation will
help you communicate technical Concepts
to non-technical employees it is
important that a business analyst notes
down all the details that they learn
from their projects this will help them
take better decisions in the future
also if similar problems Arise at a
later stage they can implement the same
solution thereby saving a lot of time
and unwanted problems while business
analysts are generally not responsible
for making decisions regarding project
Solutions decision- making skills are
still important for understanding

order to manage and maintain
requirements throughout their life cycle
it covers the creation changes
prioritization traceability and
governance
processes fourth in our list we have
strategy
analysis now this knowledge area
describes the tasks used to identify the
business need address that need and
align the change strategy within the
Enterprise you need to analyze the
current state Define the future State
assess risk and Define change
strategy then we have requirements
analysis and design definition this
knowledge area describes the tasks used
to organize requirements specify and
model requirements it also validates and
verifies information and identifies
solution options the final knowledge
area we have is solution evaluation this
knowledge area measures the solution
performance analyzes performance
measures assess solution limitations and
recommends actions to increase solution
value now let's discuss two of the most
widely used methodologies in any
business analysis process these methods
are popularly used in the industries to
ensure smooth smooth running of projects
the first methodology we are going to
talk about is the agile
methodology agile is an incremental and
iterative approach to project management
and software development it helps team
deliver value to their customers faster
and with fewer obstacles teams can
manage a project by breaking it up into
several stages and involving constant
collaboration with stakeholders along
with continuous Improvement and
iteration at every
stage so the steps involved in an agile
project development includes planning
the project in terms of business goals
budget time duration for completing the
project and resource needed then we have
designing the solution for the problem
at hand the third step is developing the
solution this could be a software a
website an application Etc it's done by
the development team next we have
testing the product in the next step of
the life cycle deploying the developed
product to check if it's working fine
and finally we have reviewing the
product and getting feedback from
customers clients stakeholders Etc now
in agile methodology the entire work is
broken down into several Sprints after
each Sprint we get a shippable product
and that product is reviewed by the
client or the stakeholder the
suggestions are Incorporated in the next
Sprint here you can see we have Sprint
one Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 and all of
them have the six steps that we
discussed in the agile methodology
process now let's discuss the scrum
methodology scrum is a subset of the
agile framework it is one of the most
widely used lightweight process
Frameworks for Agile development you can
easily collaborate develop and deliver
complex products of the highest possible
value scrum empowers the development
team and supports working in small teams
like 8 to 10 members scrum significantly
increases productivity and reduces time
this process enables organizations to
adjust smoothly to rapidly changing
requirements and produce a product that
meets evolving business goals okay so
the concepts and practices in scrum can
be divided into three categories first
we have three roles a product owner owns
the product backlog and writes user
stories and acceptance criteria they're
responsible for prioritizing the product
backlog and deciding the release date
and the content a product owner is the
one who is responsible for the return on
investment or Roi of the product a scrum
Master is a servant who encourages and
demands self-organization from the
development team they enable close
cooperation across all roles and
functions addresses resource issues and
Disobedience of scrum practices a
development team comprises individuals
working together to develop and deliver
the requested and committed product
increments the development team builds
the product and includes all the
expertise necessary to deliver the
potential shippable product each Sprint
the second category comprises of three
artifacts the product backlog is an
audit list list of the features and
requirements needed to complete the
project the list can include bugs or
defects that need to be resolved
features that must be added and other
technical or Project work your team has
to complete before the project is over
the Sprint backlog includes only what
needs to be completed during the current
Sprint it often has greater detail and
more complete user stories than the rest
of the product backlog once created no
one can add to the Sprint backlog except
the development team the product
increment is the the version of the
product that will be delivered at the
end of each Sprint while the Sprint
backlog outlines what must be completed
within a Sprint the product increment
details the outcome of all that work the
increment is a prototype or working
version of the final product expected by
the customer the final category we have
is Sprint
ceremonies there are four ceremonies in
total in Sprint planning the team meets
and decides what they need to complete
in the coming Sprint Sprint review is a
type of meeting in which the team
demonstrates what they shed in the
Sprint in the Sprint retrospective the
team reviews their work identifying what
they did well and what didn't go as
planned so that they can make the next
Sprint better daily scrum is a standup
meeting or a very short like 15 to 20
minutes meeting for the team to make
sure that they are all on the same page
now let's talk about the average annual
salary of a business analyst according
to pay scale the average annual salary
of a bus business analyst in the United
States is $ 68,9
something3 while in India a business
analyst can earn nearly 6 lakh rupees
perom now talking about the companies
hiring for business analyst we have the
Indian e-commerce payment system and
financial technology company PM American
MNC cognizant and British Dutch
multinational oil and gas company shell
we also have Cisco the search engine
giant Google and Dell finally in our
list of companies we have on and young
global limited American multinational
computer technology corporation Oracle
and British multinational Investment
Bank and financial services company ble
with that let's discuss the top business
analysis tools and software used by
business analyst we have the widely used
spreadsheet application Microsoft Excel
web- based Canen style list making
application Trello relational database
management system such as MySQL
Microsoft SQL server and postgress SQL
then we have bug tracking an agile
project management product Zera and tblo
software for data
visualization okay so let's look at our
demo on business analyst training often
times business analysts work on
structured data using Excel to prepare
reports and dashboards they do create
pivot tables and pivot charts to
summarize and analyze data find Trends
and insights to make critical
decisions so in this demo we will work
on a sees data set from the United
States and analyze the total revenue
total profit the quantity sold for
different categories and subcategories
of products across various regions
segments cities Etc now let me show you
the data set first okay so here is my
data set you can see there are
nearly
9,994 rows and we
have 17 columns you can see this is a
sales data set and the First Column is
of order date then we have the shipment
date we have the shipment mode next we
have the customer name that is the
customer who purchase the product we
have the segment the country name this
is only United States then we have the
different cities from the US we have the
state names and if I go to the right you
can see the categories of product we
also have the
subcategories next we have the product
name then we have our sales value now
you can assume this to be in
then we have the quantity that was sold
for each product then we have the
discount column and finally we have the
profit
column so let's analyze this data set
using different charts and graphs first
let's create a pivote table to see the
sales by region and year so here we want
to see the sales of all the years in
different regions of the United States
so for that I'll click on any cell
inside this data set go go to the insert
Tab and here I have the option to create
a pivote table I'll click on this create
pivote table option and you can see it
has selected my entire data and here
I'll choose new worksheet that is the
place where I want to place this pivote
table and let's click on
okay so you can see it has created a new
sheet which is sheet two and let's drag
our columns onto the different sections
in this pivote table Fields so since I
want to know the region and the year so
let's drag the order date
first
and let's delete the quarter column so
I'll click on remove
field I don't want this field so I have
my ears first and then let's
drag region
column under
columns and we want to know the sales
for all the years in different regions
so I'll drag sales onto
values you can see here we have our
pivote table ready if you want you can
go ahead and rename these row labels and
column
labels now with this table ready let's
create a line chart this will help you
analyze your data better so what you can
do is go to the insert Tab and here
under recommended charts you can go for
line chart you can see the line chart
preview here and click on
okay there you go how easily Excel has
created a pivote chart for US based on
this pivote
table now if you notice the lines in
this graph you can see the different
regions and here is the legend now if
you see the yellow line which is
actually for the west region so the
sales had declined from
2014 to
2015 and then it gradually started
increasing from 2015 to 2017 onwards and
if you see the orange line or the red
line it is for the east region the sales
have been continuously increasing you
can see the trend here similarly if you
see the central region the sales
generated was steady from 2014 till
2015 then it increased in 2016 and after
2016 it became
constant similarly you can analyze the
South Region as
well now let's say you want to know the
sales by each category of product and
the different segments so you can do
that as well let's go to our sheet one
where we have our data set let me click
on any cell I'll go to insert and I'll
choose pivote table here let it be new
worksheet I'll click on okay all right
so since we want to know the sales value
again so let's drag sales onto values
field and now I'll
choose
category under rows
so let's select category under rows and
then we want to know for each segment
also so what I can do is I'll choose
segment under columns you can see I have
my P table ready so here you have the
furniture office supplies and Technology
as the categories of products and on the
top you can see consumer corporate home
office as the different
segments now let's create
a visual out of this pivot table so I'll
go to recommended chart s and let's say
this time I want
to create a bar chart now this is a
horizontal bar chart let's click on okay
if I close
this and I bring it to here you can see
this is a nice bar chart and Below you
can see the sales values and on the y-
axis you can see the different
categories of products and in the legend
we have the segments now if you want you
can did this chart as well so let's
delete or hide all field buttons on the
chart all right similarly let's do this
for our line chart as well let's hide
these field buttons
okay all right
now let's suppose you want to know which
segment meet the highest and the lowest
profits so for that you can and create a
pivot table as well so I'll click on any
cell go to the insert Tab and choose
pivote table I'll click on okay all
right now say we want to know the profit
by each segment so I'll first choose
profit onto
values
and let's drag the segment
column onto rows so we have our pivot
table
ready now here if you want to know which
segment meet the highest or the lowest
profit you can sort this data so click
on any sell under sum of
profit right click and here you have the
short option so let's do sort smallest
to largest which is in ascending order
okay so here you can see consumer
segment meet the highest amount of
profit while the home office segment
made the lowest amount of profit now
based on this pivot table you can create
a pie chart let's do that I'll go to
insert and here under recommended charts
I'll select pi and let's click on okay
there you go we have a nice pie chart
ready now the gray color Pi represents
your consumer segment which me the
highest amount of profit you can also
validate it from the pivot table while
the blue segment which is actually home
office made the lowest amount of profit
now let's remove this field from here
I'll right click and select hide all
field buttons on the chart now one thing
you can do is you can edit the chart
Title Here by default it has shown total
we can rename it to let's say profit by
segment and hit
enter okay now you can adjust the size
of this and the color of the text if you
want you can do it from here so
similarly
let's add a title to our bar graph as
well so here if you
see there's an option to choose chart
title and I'll say sales
by
segment and
category okay similarly let's add a
title to our first line chart that we
created I'll click on the chart title
and here I'll write sales by year and
region
okay now let me go back to
my data sheet now suppose let's say you
want to know the total units that were
sold for each subcategory of products
and the shipment mode so here we have
the shipment mode and you want to know
the total units that were sold which is
basically this column the quantity
column for each subcategories of product
you can see we have different
subcategories like bookcases there
chairs labels The Stables Furnishings
art phones binders Etc so let's create a
pivote table for this I'll go to the
insert tab click on pivote table and
click on okay all right now since we
want to know the total units that were
sold let's drag the quantity column
under
values and I'll
choose the ship mode field under columns
and let's select subcategory under rows
so I have my pivote table ready now
based on this pivote table let's create
a line chart I'll go to the insert tab
click on recommended charts and let's go
to line chart all right you can see the
preview here and the Legends which show
the shipment mode Let's click on
okay I'll close this now first let's
remove these fields I'll right click and
I'll hide all field buttons now if you
see this one you can add some styles to
your chart let's modify our chart a bit
let's say I'll select
yeah this one you can see it has given
dots for each end points which means
this is my first subcategory as you can
see the second subcategory have the
third subcategory which is Art then we
have binders so it's really easy to read
and understand the chart
well okay now let's add a chart title
I'll write
quantity
sold by
subcategory and ship
mode you can reduce the size of the
chart title text let's keep
it 10
okay now you also have the feature to
create different kinds of maps in
Excel so
suppose you want to see the states that
meet the highest and the lowest sales in
the United States so you can create a
field map for that so first of all let's
go to our data sheet I'll click on any
cell go to insert and create a pivote
table I click on okay all right so since
we want
the state and the country so let me
first drag country field under rows and
then I'll choose the State field under
rows now
let's drag sales under
values okay so we have
our pivot table ready now if I sort this
data you can easily
know that California state me the
highest amount of sales now if I scroll
down below you can
see North Dakota made the lowest amount
of
sales now let's do one thing let's
remove the grand total so you can go to
the design Tab and under Grand totals
you can select the first option you can
see the grand total has
gone and in order to create a map we
need to adjust this poo table so I'll
click on United States I'll right click
and I'll go to field
settings here under layout and print
I'll click on show item labels in
tabular format and I'll also click on
repeat item labels you can
see it will populate United States for
all the rows if I click on okay you can
see the United States have been
populated for all the
states now let
me select this table
or before that let's remove
the sub tootal from here I'll close this
go to the design tab under
subtles I'll choose to not show subtles
okay now let's select the
table and I'll actually paste it
somewhere
here now with this data I can go to the
insert Tab and choose Maps let's select
field map there you
go you see we have a nice field map of
the United States and here you can see
the color
scale so it goes from light gray all the
way up to dark blue so the states that
are in dark blue let's say California
made the highest amount of sales you can
also validate it from the pivote table
similarly the lighter the color the
amount of sales were less for that state
now let's give a chart title
here I'll give a chart title
as sales by
stats and let's remove this
Legend now you can format this map so
here you can change colors and let's see
if I choose this one you can see the
color has changed
and you can see the California
state is shaded in dark which means it
meet the highest amount of sales you can
also add data labels you can see it will
show the sales values for each of the
states and if you want you can keep the
legend as well I'll just remove these
two all right now similarly you can also
create a field map to see the profits by
each state so you can analyze which
states meet the highest amount of profit
and the state that meet the lowest
amount of profit so let's do that I'll
go to my data
sheet I'll click on insert and select
pivote table let's click on
okay now first and foremost let's drag
country under rows and then I'll choose
State under
rows next
let's Drag The Profit column under
values so I have
my pivote table
ready let's go to the design Tab and
remove the
subtles I'll select do not show sub toal
if I scroll
down okay I have my grand total now so
let's go to the design tab under Grand
toles we'll remove it okay now let's
just populate the United states which is
the country name for all the
rows I'll right click on United States
go to field settings click on layout and
print I'll choose select item labels in
tabular form and select repeat item
labels let's click on okay so I have my
country name populated
throughout let's select the pivote
table I'll paste it somewhere
here and now let's go to the insert
tab I'll choose map let's select field
map there you go now we have the profits
for each of the
states let's first delete
this and edit our chart
title which
is profit
by
States okay let's close this
let's
say we'll use this one
now okay let's edit the color of the
chart
title I'll make it as
white and let's
say
will choose the
color
as say this one okay now let me go ahead
and remove the
Legend here and just delete it all right
so we have our field map ready which
shows profit by each
state now that we are done with our
analysis and creating our different
pivote tables and pivote charts let's
build the final
dashboard so let's create a new sheet
here okay the first thing I need to do
is I'll go to the view Tab and I'll
remove the grid lines all right now
let's go to the insert Tab and here we
have text let me choose text
box let's create a text box
here
okay now you can reduce the size
actually let's reduce
it okay
and you can move it to the
top all right let's pull this a little
down and this to little
right let's fill the text box color with
blue color and let's give the text as
Sals
dashboard and
we'll give a white color to the text and
I'll select my font you can select any
font you want so I'll go
with let's
say Brittanic bold okay we have it
here and let's increase the size to
30 and we'll Center align it all right
now the next step is
to bring all our pivote ch charts to
this dashboard sheet so I'll first copy
my pivote
chart and I'll paste it in sheet 8 let's
paste it
here and we can reduce the
size okay now similarly let's do it for
the other charts as well I'll copy this
and let's paste it somewhere here
okay now let me just reduce the
size and if you want you can reduce the
chart title font size as well let's make
it 11 okay and let's drag this a
bit all right now
let's copy the pie
chart and let me paste it here let's
reduce the size of this pie chart
okay see we have our pie chart here
now let
me take my line chart which shows the
quantity sold by different subcategories
of product I'll copy it and let me paste
it somewhere here I'll close this
we need to reduce the size so that we
can fit in our other charts as
well okay let me reduce a bit
more all right now we are left with the
two maps that we created let's copy this
and let's paste it
here I'll go to the
right let's reduce the size
similarly we'll do it
for sales
by profit map as
well let's copy this and paste it onto
our
dashboard let's reduce the size
first and let's increase it
towards the
bottom so we have our dashboard ready
you can see the different P charts that
we
created now let's add slicers and
timelines to this dashboard so that we
can filter our tables and the charts so
I'll click on this first chart which is
our line chart I'll go to the insert tab
here you can see under filters we have
slicers and timeline first let me click
on timeline and here I'll choose my
order date column let me click on okay
all right let's drag this a bit here
onto the right and I'll show you how you
can use this let's first choose years
instead of
months and let me reduce the size a bit
okay now another thing to do here is let
me right click and and I'll go to report
connections here I'll select all my
pivote tables instead of just one so
that any manipulation you do in the
order ear it will reflect for all the
tables or the charts we have on the
dashboard I click on
okay now that we have seen how to add a
timeline I'll reduce this a bit let's
now add a few
slicers let's click click on any of the
charts I'll go to insert click on
slicer now let's add a region slicer
I'll click on
okay and let's take it to the right
we'll reduce the size of this region
slicer slicers are nothing but filters
which have advanced filtering
options
and we can add one more filter or a
slicer let's
say we want to do this time
on the segment so I'll go to
slicer I'll choose segment here and
click on okay so you can see I have my
segment slicer here let me just reduce
the
size and let's drag it here at the
bottom all right
okay now if you want to know the sales
and profit for a particular year so you
can choose that particular year here on
the timeline suppose I want to know the
sales only for 2014 and
2015 so the way to do is you can select
one of the years so I'll click on
2014 and now I'll drag this to select
2015 as
well if I go to left
left the figures that you see only
reflect the sales and the profit for
2014 and 15
similarly if you Mark here or let me
just bring it to the middle suppose say
I want
to have 2016 year included as well I can
just drag it to the right you can see
the charts will
change I'll just remove the filter and
and place it here similarly if you want
to see the sales and profit
for a particular region you can do that
too for example let me just bring this
region slicer here and let's say you
want to know the sales and profit only
for the east region you see here it
shows only for the east region and
suppose you want to see for east and
west region also you can see it's
changes
here okay me just cancel
this now you might be wondering when we
selected the different regions only the
pie chart changed but the rest of the
charts were the same now the reason was
we did not apply this slicer to all the
pivot tables so let me right click and
go to report connections here I'll
choose the remaining pivote tables as as
well I click on okay all right now let
me just bring this to the middle and
let's say we want to know the sales and
the profits and the quantity sold for
let's say South
Region if I select this you can see it
shows only for the South Region let's
see you also want to know for the
central region now we have selected both
Central and South you can see the
variations in the graph and we cancel
this similarly we have our another
slicer which is the
segment I'll populate the slicer for all
the other pivot
tables let me choose all of them and
click on okay I'll bring this to the
middle so that you can see the
variations in the graph let's say I want
to know the sales the unit souls and the
profit for home office segment so I'll
only select home office you can see the
variations here
now the slices actually don't work for
the maps so you can't see any change
here now suppose you want to know for
the corporate segment you can select
corporate or if you want to select for
multiple segments you can do that as
well just cancel
this and let me place it
here all right now we are done with our
demo now let's see what powerbi is
powerbi is a business analytics service
provided by Microsoft that lets you
visualize your data and share insights
it converts data from different sources
to build interactive dashboards and bi
reports as you can see we have an Excel
data about sales using this data powerbi
helps you build different charts and
graphs to visualize the data now that we
have understood what powerbi is let us
look at the important features of
powerbi first is powerbi desktop powerbi
desktop is a free software that you can
download and it allows you to build
reports by accessing data easily for
using powerbi desktop you do not need
Advanced report designing or query
skills to build a report second as
already discussed powerbi supports
stream analytics from Factory sensors to
social media sources powerbi assists in
realtime analytics to make timely
decisions third support for multiple
data sources is one of the major
features of powerbi you can access
various sources of data such as Excel
CSV SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of powerbi while dealing with complex
data powerbi default standard might not
be enough in some cases in that case you
can access the custom library of
visualization that meets your needs let
us jump into discussing the various
components of RBI as you can see there
are six major components of powerbi now
let's discuss them one by one first is
power query power query is the data
transformation and mass up engine it
enables you to discover connect combine
and refine data sources to meet your
analysis need it can be downloaded as an
addin for Excel or can be used as part
of powerb desktop second we have power
pivote power pivote is a data modeling
technology that lets you create data
models it also allows you to establish
relationships and create calculations it
uses data analysis expression language
or Dax to model simple and complex data
third we have power view Power view is a
technology that is available in Excel
SharePoint SQL server and powerbi it
lets you create interactive charts
graphs maps and other visuals that
brings your data to Life Next we have
power map Microsoft's power map for
Excel and powerbi is a 3D data
visualization tool that lets you map
your data and plot more than a million
rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3D
format from an Excel table or data model
in Excel then we have powerbi desktop
powerbi desktop is a development tool
for power query power pivote and Power
view with powerbi desktop you have
everything under the same solution and
it is easy easier to develop b and data
analysis experience finally we have
power Q&A the Q&A feature in powerbi
lets you explore your data in your own
words it is the fastest way to get an
answer from your data using natural
language an example could be what was
the total sales last year once you have
built your data model and deployed that
into powerbi website then you can ask
questions and get answers easily now
let's see what powerbi service is
powerbi service is the software as a
Serv service part of powerbi it is also
referred as powerbi online to access
powerbi service you need to log to app.
powerbi.com now let me show you that
I'll go to Google open a new tab and
search for app.
powerbi.com
it's
loading this is how the homepage of
powerbi service looks like I've have
created some dashboards on it first you
need to log to app. powerbi service you
can see I'm logged in now under my
workspace if I go to dashboard here I
have created a finance dashboard you can
see the different charts and graphs I
have prepared and pinned it to the
dashboard so powerbi service allows you
to connect to your data create reports
and dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data now as you can
see in this dashboard we have created
some charts and graphs so this is a tree
map there's a pie chart there's a bar
graph below you can see there are line
charts and donut charts it tells you the
total sales that were made the total
number of unit solds the sales by
product sales by country sales by
segment and lots more one of the key
features of powerbi is creating
dashboards from multiple reports and
data sets powerbi dashboard is a single
page visualization to tell a story The
visualizations on a dashboard are
generated from multiple reports and each
report is based on one data set a single
page dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles
these tiles are pinned to the dashboard
by report designers now let me go back
to my dashboard so this is called a
canvas and each of these are called
tiles so on the top you can see we have
three tiles now let's understand how to
create and publish reports in powerbi
dashboards powerbi allows you to create
different reports on powerbi desktop
these reports can be published on the
powerbi dashboard using powerbi service
here you can see there is a powerbi
report created on powerbi desktop if you
click on publish it will take you to the
powerbi service where you can build a
dashboard here is the button for powerbi
publish once you click on powerbi
publish it will take you to the
dashboard so this is a single page
powerbi dashboard on powerbi service now
let's understand the powerbi
architecture powerbi architecture is a
service built on top of a z there are
multiple data sources that powerbi can
connect to powerbi desktop allows you to
create reports and data visualizations
on the data set powerbi Gateway is
connected to on premise data sources to
get continuous data for reporting and
analytics powerbi services are basically
the cloud services that are used to
publish powerbi reports and data
visualizations using powerbi mobile apps
you can stay connected to their data
from anywhere powerbi apps are available
for Windows IOS and Android platforms I
wondered what those people with fancy
charts on their computers are doing they
are probably business analyst so what's
a business analyst think of them as the
shadow homes of the business world they
look at lots of information and figure
out how to make companies run better and
guess what it's a pretty cool job right
now lots of companies are trying to hire
these folks want to know how much they
make on average about
$85,000 per year some of them even make
over
$120,000 not bad right but here's the
thing to be really good at this job you
need to know some special words it's
like learning the secret code of
business and in today's video we are
going to look at the 10 important words
every business analyst should know and
by the time we are done you will be
talking like a pro so let's start with a
little story meet Joan Joan works at a
company and is always overwhelmed by all
the data terms his colleagues use during
meetings so words like kpis data
warehouse and analytics were thrown
around and Joan often felt lost he knew
understanding these terms was crucial
for his career growth so he decided to
dive into into learning about business
intelligence Jones started by learning
what business intelligence actually
means he discovered that bi invols
strategies and technologies that help
companies analyze and manage their data
for example if he worked at Spotify bi
could tell him which songs are getting
the most pleas when people listen the
most and even predict the next big hit
this realization made Jan see how
powerful bi could be for making informed
business decisions all right so let's
dive in and let's understand what
business intelligence actually is
imagine you're running a popular ice
cream shop and business intelligence is
like having a super smart helper that
tells you everything about your business
cool right so what exactly is business
intelligence it's all the tricks and
tools companies use to understand the
data better it helps them make smart
choices based on facts not just cases
for example let's say you use a tool
like powerbi in your ice cream shop it
might show you which flavors sell the
most on H days what time your shop is
busiest and which toppings are most
popular with kids this info helps you
make smart decisions like stocking up on
popular flavors or hiring extra stuff
for busy times business intelligence is
super important because it turns boring
numbers into useful information that
helps businesses grow and succeed it's
like having x-ray vision for your
company NeXT let's talk about data
visualization so data visualization is
the graphical representation of
information and data by using visual
elements like charts graphs and Maps
data visualization tools provide an
accessible way to see and understand
Trends outliers and patterns in data for
example a bar chart showing the most
popular pza toppings in a delivery app
this is crucial for presenting data in
an easy to understand format moving on
we have analytics so analytics involves
the systematic computational analysis of
data for example using analytics to
understand which times of day are
busiest for a Piza delivery app this
term is important because it helps in
making sense of large amounts of data
and AIDS in decision making next up is
kpi that is key performance indicator so
kpi is a measurable value that
demonstrates how effectively a company
is achieving key business objectives for
example tracking the number of visas
sold each month as a kpi to measure
business performance kpis are essential
for measuring performance and progress
towards strategic goals now let's
discuss data warehouse so data warehouse
is a centralized repository for storing
large volumes of structured data from
multiple sources for example storing
customer data from different gym
branches in one place for analysis it is
used for reporting and data analysis and
is a core component of business
intelligence data warehouses are
important for consolidating data from
different sources and making it
available for analysis next we have
database so database is an organized
collection of data generally stored and
accessed electronically from a computer
system for example a database storing
member records for a gym databases are
foundational for storing and managing
data efficiently and are critical for
any business intelligence processes
moving forward let's introduce data
mining so data mining is the process of
discovering patterns and knowledge from
large amounts of data for example a gym
analyzing member attendance to identify
the most popular class times data mining
is important for extracting useful
information from large data sets next
let's talk about dashboard so dashboard
is a business intelligence tool that
allows users to track key matrics and
kpis for example a dashboard for a gym
showing daily attendance most used
equipment and membership growth it
provides a visual representation of data
and helps in monitoring performance at a
glance dashboards are crucial for
realtime data monitoring and decision
making next up is reporting reporting
refers to the process of organizing data
into informational summaries to monitor
how different areas of a business are
performing for example a monthly
financial report summarizing income and
expenses for a gym reports are essential
for tracking progress identifying Trends
and making informed decisions finally
let's discuss SQL that is structured
query language so SQL is a standard
programming language for managing and
manipulating databases for example
writing an SQL query to retrieve all gym
members who joined last month it is used
to query insert update and modify data
SQL is fundamental for anyone working
with databases and business intelligent
tools remember whether you are running a
multi-million dollar Corporation or a
neighborhood laminate stand these bi
tools and Concepts can help you make
smarter decisions and grow your business
they turn row data into valuable
insights helping you understand your
customer better optimize your operations
and stay ahead of the competition so
with that guys we have come to the end
of this session I hope this video has
helped domestify some key business
intelligence terms for you if you found
this video helpful don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to our
channel for more business and Tech
insights if you have questions about bi
or want to share your opinion you can
comment down in the comment section
below with today's topic which is about
how to create powerbi dashboard in a few
minutes Yes you heard me right you can
create a complete powerbi dashboard or
also known as a report in just a few
clicks and a few minutes now in this
particular video we are minimizing the
time in creating dashboard because
sometimes data cleaning process you
already know if you're an expert or if
you're a beginner in data anal antics
you already know there are steps in data
report or dashboard right first you load
the data from a source it can be Cloud
PDF Excel workbook CSV or anything and
after that you do some data cleaning
right you split the columns or you
eliminate some blank rows blank columns
and some irrelevant data which does not
fit or some um for more reference on
data cleaning you can also refer to the
video which is linked in the description
box below and so right that's the proc
process so basically you import the data
from The Source clean it transform it
and then load it and then create a
dashboard right so in this particular
video we have the completely cleaned
data set which is really available for
creating report which will be also
linked in the description box below if
you want to follow us along so um with
that uh let's get started right so
that's how it goes now let's have a look
at our data so our data has um some row
ID order ID a date ship date so
basically you can totally understand
this particular data set is about sales
report right let's say I'm working with
XYZ company which is based on data
analytics and I get an email from my
client that he or she wants to know how
exactly the sales are performing in what
exact States or countries and uh what
exact regions and what category of
products or subcategory of products and
what's the sales quantity order profit
right so let's say you have a one uh
category or subcategory or a product
which is giving you high number of sales
and profit right you want to improve
more you can increase the price or let's
say you have some product which is not
performing so well right so you can uh
offer some uh discounts let's say like
50% off so that you can move out the
product from your store right right so
some uh basically if you analyze the
data and you come up to a decision where
which product is performing in which
region or state or country and which
product is performing in not performing
in which region state or country right
you can come up with the strategy for
sales and improve your Revenue so that's
the entire process right so with that
said so this is the data we have and
let's quickly jump onto powerbi and get
going with create a report or dashboard
within a few minutes right so here we
are on the powerbi desktop so here
absolutely you can see you can import
data from Excel you can import data from
SQL Server you can import data from a
blank table or use some sample data AP
from that you can also get data from a
different sources as well right see uh
we will be trying to do some automation
right so regarding the automation we can
also
go through another video from Simply
learn which will help you understand how
to automate the process of data
transformation cleaning and uploading so
uh you can just give the file location
here the folder so I'm going going with
the folder here so it will give me a new
window uh you can go to browse and I
think I have my folder in
downloads and uh Excel data sets um
Excel I think I'll be having that name
named
as sales report yes just click okay and
you have the sales report
here can have a quick preview of the
data so here you have the options
combine load transform data right you
can just directly load because I've said
you that this particular data set is
completely clean and is ready for
reports right so you can just select the
data you want and just load right
I'm doing it this way because let's say
uh for let's not not let's say uh we
have uh the data here in a form in in
such a form that the data is from last 3
to four years right so let me selected
this
way so in this case as well it will take
the Excel file and uh even if you add
some more data to it it will uh apply
the changes to it right so let's say uh
we have the data for the last four years
2020
209 2021 2 and 3 and since 2024 is not
completed yet we are not taking that
data let's say we enter into 2025 then
the new data for 2024 gets updated and
loaded onto the same data table and you
don't have to uh you know process the
data once again clean it transform it
load it no that's not going to happen
you can just load the data you can just
drop the data on on the Excel
spreadsheet and your dashboard or report
will reflect the new changes
automatically just by refreshing your
dashboard right that's the automation
you can do so what exactly automation is
the process where human effort is not
involved and the computer or your any uh
tool that's the job for you is called as
automation which reduces a lot of time
of yours and you can use that valuable
time to plan on the strategies to
improve your Revenue right that's the
overall Moto of data analytics now
that's the uh preview of the data I'm
just going to directly load it I'm not
going to transform it because uh it's
completely clean and transform data and
ready for reports so here you go and uh
you can close if there are minute errors
you can just close it and uh if you want
to check your data you can go to your
data here and you can have the sample
data right here right if you check the r
date not ship date sorry
uh ship date can enter into uh 2023 as
well right so here you have 2020 and the
other dates right so you will have okay
let's go to the data filter so you
basically have four years not 2024 right
so uh that's the way if you just add the
2024 data it will automatically reflect
in the visualization now uh all that we
need is create a dashboard or report
which will help pass and license data
right so uh let's get started just
double click on the report section and
here you will have icon or visit which
will ask you what exactly you're looking
for preparing Q&A so I
want region wise sales and I want it in
a bar
graph there you go you have the region
by sales and Barra press on uh okay and
you have it and you can place it
somewhere in the corner then if you want
another one double click and you want
category
wise category
sales and let's take that in pie
chart category sales pie and here you
have it press on agree and accept and
you have it over here and ear on ear
sales in a langra
sales by date or sales
by sales by date line
graph here you have it accept that so
that you can identify which is the peak
uh performance ER or Peak Performance
date for us which gave us the highest
number of sales in a certain region
right so here we have it you can place
it can customize it right and now let's
go for category double click and uh
subcategory I think we have a hyph a
space
there say it's uh the type of chart you
want you can go with the donut
one select that and
it so you have a subcategory voice sale
and now let's go with uh
region wise I mean the country wise
right so let's go to the data again here
so here we have segment city state
country okay let's go with country now
right
country country
sales map chart so whenever you have a
region or state or a country involved
go with map charts it's the best way to
represent right so we have considered
European nations over here so for that
reason we have the European States here
and uh now we can go with let's go with
the data once again and have a look what
else we can do and shiping mode right so
you have the shipment mode as well so uh
you can identify what type of shipment
mode customers are majorly
preferring shipment mode bar
graph a so basically I think we have uh
three types of shipment
mode let's check the column name of
shipment mode properly ship mode it's
not shipment mode it's ship mode right
so let's type again ship
mode
bar
graph okay shipment mode sales
Barra there you go so agree accepted so
you have standard shipment is the most
preferred one now we have this so let's
add some kpis here so uh kpi of
sales you will adjust that agree there
you go and let's add a kpi for
profit and you have it
agree kpi for Revenue double
click let's check if we have a column
called Revenue quantity discount profit
right so let's go with
quantity and
discount so revenue is not added so it's
okay
so you can identify which uh uh product
or subcategory is highly selling in in
number of quantities so you have you'll
have some of profit some of sales some
of quantity and what else we left the
last one discount and rate sales
discount profit so let's identify if we
have offered
any okay
so let's add a kpi or rate as well if we
are completely focusing on a single
product a single category we must be
having uh kPa for rate as well double
click somewhere kpi on
rate there you go accepted and you have
the
completely
formatted dashboard or sales report
ready
for a meeting let's close all these so
that we have a better visualization and
you can just go to the uh slides share
mode or fit to the page mode where you
can have it that's good so uh this is
how you create a completely functional
fully functional sales report or sales
dashboard just within a few clicks and
just within a few minutes let's say uh I
want the sales report only for central
region click that and it's completely
interactive and let's say we don't want
that click outside and you will have
everything back to the normal right and
let's say I wanted to focus on a
particular category technology category
alone they have the sales happening and
the subcategory of sales and what are
the products over here right you'll have
that and which is the country uh
happening to ship the most of them and
what's the shipment more preferred by
them and highest performing date or year
so here you can see 20 22 June was the
highest performance for sales and uh the
lowest one is somewhere here in March
2020 or something right so that's how
you can create a fully interactive
dashboard or report based on sales data
in a few minutes and in a few clicks and
that brings us to the end of this
tutorial on the topic how to create a
completely functional sales report or
sales dashboard in a few clicks and in a
few minutes have you ever wondered how
companies use data to make important
decisions and improve their operations

comes in business intelligence also
known as bi is a set of tools and
processes that help organizations
analyze data and make informed decisions
it's like a crystal ball that helps
businesses see into the future and make
strategic decisions based on the data
analysis but how exactly does bi work
well it starts with collect in data from
multiple sources like transaction Data
customer data and social media data this
data is then processed and analyzed
using bi tools like dashboards reports
and analytical models the insights
provided by bi helps organizations
identify Trends patterns and
opportunities that they can use to make
better decisions and drive growth so in
this video we are going to take you

data present in this world is never
ending so are the jobs for people
working on this data to make proper
insights well at its score business
intelligence often referred to as bi is
the process of collecting analyzing and
transforming raw data into actionable
insights for business purposes it helps
organizations make informed decisions
enhance performance and gain a
Competitive Edge in today's Dynamic
market so let's understand the steps
involved in the processing of data the
first step in the business intelligence
process is data collection businesses
Begin by identifying the relevant data
sources for their operations such as
internal databases customer interactions
website analytics and social media
platform once identified the necessary
data is extracted from each source which
can be in various formats like
spreadsheets or databases before
proceeding it's important to cleanse the
data by removing duplicates errors or
inconsistencies ensuring its accuracy
and reliability the second step is data
integration with the collected data in
hand the next step is data integration
businesses transform the data into a
unified format that is compatible and
consistent across different data sources
this transformation involves
standardizing data formats organizing
fields and creating a unified data
structure the transform data from
various sources is then merged into a
central repository or data warehouse
serving as a single source of Truth for
further analysis and Reporting the third
step is data analysis businesses select
appropriate analysis techniques based on
their objectives which can include
exploratory data analysis statistical
modeling data visualization or machine
learning algorith Ms using these
techniques businesses uncover patterns
Trends and correlation within the data
these insights provide valuable
information about customer Behavior
market trends operational efficiency
product insights and more to communicate
the findings effectively businesses
create reports and visualizations that
present the insights in a clear and
understandable format the fourth step is
decision making and action the final
step in the business intelligence
Journey is turning insights into actions
armed with the insights from data
analysis businesses make informed
decisions these decisions can range from
optimizing operational processes and
refining Market strategies to improving
customer experience and identifying new
business opportunities businesses
continuously monitor the impact of their
decisions and actions using feedback
loops and iterative processes to refine
strategies adapt to changing market
conditions and improve overall
performance

an essential tool that can help
businesses succeed in today's
Marketplace so what is Excel macro you
do certain daily task and daily reports
or monthly reports that you generate and
you use data from your Excel and use CR
up data and you basically have the same
things performed or done on the Excel
sheets every time and every day or
monthly or bi-weekly or any number of
times that you open your Excel you
remove certain columns you add certain
things and you change certain values and
these are the things that you do an N
number of times on an Excel and this can
all be done
by simple
automated wave which is macros so what
it does is it is a set of task that you
can execute as many number of times as
you want when you create a macro
basically what it does is it will record
all your mouse clicks and keystrokes
basically if for example you have your
monthly accounts report that is there
and it comes every day and you have to
put it and extract certain data and
remove certain columns that you do every
time that you open that sheet for
instance you remove that column I which
has the obsolute values of of your
accounts or the sheets that you have and
you remove that column and you edit some
names you add sear things every time
that you open that report and then you
format it in a proper way and send it to
your management so this can all be done
in a simp simple running script called
macros so what you do is you record
those Mouse clicks and keystrokes and
record a macro for it save it and next
time tomorrow when you come you just run
that macros and this will do everything
for you and you do not have to do that
same tedious task every day so this is
basically a set of codes or a task that
you can execute and automate and it can
be done a number of times so it makes
your life easy now so next thing is how
you actually activate the macros in your
Excel it's a simple uh tab that you need
to add in the ribbon section which I'll
be showing you across and this will
enable the macros on your Excel so you
go to
files go to options and then you need to
customize what then customize ribbon and
then there is a developer tab which you
see here it should be activated so you
just need to select that click on the uh
tick mark and just click okay so this
will add a developer tab here and this
will enable the macros so now you you
have your data and you can run macros or
record a macro and run it over on your
Excel there is also an option to do do
it a different way right click on any of
the tabs on the ribbon customize ribbon
and you can add or remove your Macros
from here so this is two ways that you
need to that you can activate uh your
Macros so how you record a macro is the
next thing so here I have a workorders
sheet that I receive every day or one of
you will receive every day and how you
record a macro you have certain set of
task that you do and you know this
report has so many things that are
obsolete which you do not need which has
to be put across uh to your management
or your for your use so how you record
or uh start a macro you go to the
developer tab and start recording a
macro as soon as you click on this
record macro button it will start uh
recording your key strokes on the mouse
mouse click
and you can save that and run it as a
script in the next sheet that you do so
this is the sheet that I have and we'll
try to run a macros on this and see what
it
does so here I have and uh this actually
works this way uh I need to go to the
developer tab and start recording a
macro so when I click record macro it uh
starts uh recording my mouse clicks and
keystrokes so in this sheet I have to
you know remove some columns and uh the
columns that are Obsolete and the data
that looks uh weird here should be
removed and all what I need is the work
order number the district and the
techncian name and the kind of service
that we provide and the request date
work date the cost and the payment so
this is what I want and I do it every
day when I receive the sheet and I have
to make these changes and send it across
to the accounts team so what I do is I
simply automate this by running a macro
so I go
to let's see how it records the
macro I click record macro I save it as
work order
accounts and I'll add a little
description
like work
orders
for account
team
cost click okay
and see what I do is basically I add the
borders
first so that the data looks proper and
then I do not want this column I delete
it I do not want the number of
technicians that are there I do not want
all these and I also want the labor R
the account and what kind of payment
this is very crucial for the account
Teem I do not want any of these obili
data so I just delete this okay and then
I just want to have some cosmetic
changes done
so I make sure this doesn't have any
border and that's it this is the task
that I
perform every day I still don't need
this and I go to the developer tab and
click stop recording so now I have the
macro save and when I have it I have you
know automated these all these steps in
one simple click and how I execute it in
another sheet
so I will show it across to you the next
thing so here I have the next uh report
that has to be uh changed or formatted
and send it across so I simply go the
next morning and go to the developer tab
and go to the macro and I have this
macro Save which we ran the just now and
I simple with a single click I will be
able to do this daily task and execute
in a Flash so I just click run and it
does the rest for me I have my report
ready and is in a proper format that is
required and it can be sent across so
here as we see it is done in a single
click by running a simple macro
continuing our work on macro we can
simply do this by a single click of a
button by adding a button so what you
have to do is go to the developer tab
and in the control section you will see
the insert option when you click on the
insert drop down you will see uh form
controls and you can say select a button
and here I select a button and the mouse
changes into a cross and you can add
your macro and assign it so as we have
saved it work order accounts as a macro
and when I just uh assign that macro to
this button I can edit the text
by making it as work order account just
to make it simple
okay and now if you see if I just click
this button it will run the
macro and format our sheet so this is
how we run the macros in a single click
of a button by adding the
button there is another alternative way
to go to the macros in instead of the
developer tab and you go to the view
button and then go to macros at the end
you can view macros you can record and
you can edit your Macros so when I click
view macros it will show you what are
the macros that I have and that I can
run and you can simply run it
alternatively and you can record a macro
as well instead of from the the
developer tab if you just click on
record macro it will do the same
functions that we do from the developer
tab the next thing is to edit the macro
how do you edit your macro you have uh
to use a simple application in Excel
which is the VBA Visual Basic
application to edit your macro you go to
the developer tab and then click on
Visual Basic this literally opens
another
window like this and you will see the
module that you have been working on and
you can edit the macro here so as we see
if you go back to the Excel we see that
uh our sheet we have been working on um
the sheet and it has the column still K
and the actual sheet is this so if I go
to the Visual Basic
editor and
I'll make sure you know I remove the
columns that are existing from the
column M and I just delete that and I
click
run I go back to my sheet and you see
these changes are not there
okay this is our old macro and this is
our new macro
as we see this sheet has the rush column
which is the priority of my orders so
these are the things that we can edit
with the
VBA so here we are what is VBA Visual
Basic application it is basically a
Visual Basic application language uh
that is used for macros in Excel so what
it basically does Visual Basic for
application is a programming language of
excel that helps you automate task by
writing macros we have seen how we use
macros how it simplifies our TDS daily
task by running a simple macro now to
help us you know write these macros and
help us get the best use of our
abilities
to ease our work and automate our task
we use VBA
so why VBA there are many advantages of
using VBA and why we prefer VBA in
macros for Excel so basically it is a
very simple language it saves time in
Pro performing TDS tasks you have number
of tasks that you do every day as we
have seen in the previous section how we
uh you can simplify your daily task by
just running a simple macro and this uh
VBA helps us in performing those tasks
in a very simple manner another thing is
it supports english- like statements
there are multiple statements that you
can use and which are very basic English
language statements and this can help us
or it is very easy to program or code or
edit these commands you can select a
range you can it is like a if and L
statement and things like that we'll
look into those in details in the next
sections now one more thing is it
improves the functionality of excel by
allowing you to make Excel behave the
way you want there are multiple function
that you perform in Excel like selecting
a number of rows or columns or selecting
a set of cells in particular you do it
in a daily basis so these things can
easily be performed and easily be added
and executed by using VBA we will look
into those in detail now what is the VBA
editor interface this is particularly uh
an interface which you will have uh look
in detail uh where where you can edit
your commands or your codes for your
Excel now how this is uh achieved we
will see it here now these are the this
is basically the VBA editor interface
where you can see the uh this is the
toolbar section where it shows all the
options where undo or save or file we'll
see those details in the next section
this is basically the toolbar section of
the VBA editor interface the next thing
is the menu bar menu bar as we all know
it is simply shows you the menu wherein
you have all the options like file edit
view insert insert is the one very
important uh menu bar option and when
you can insert different modules and
buttons and all we'll look into those in
details run is one more important thing
all these things fall under menu bar the
next thing is the VBA code window VBA
code window as it says is the code
window where your actual code resides
where in you can go into it and edit the
code or write the codes and select the
different range of functions that you
can perform and this is basically the B
VBA code window where you edit your or
write your codes the next thing is the
project Explorer project Explorer is
simply like a Windows Explorer but this
is in particular is specific to your VBA
wherein it shows the different options
that are there the the Excel sheets or
the worksheets that you're working on or
the modules that you have save and so on
basically it is an Explorer for your PBA
like a Windows Explorer which is for the
file explorer the next thing is the
properties window properties window
shows you the properties of the
worksheet that you're working on for
instance here we are working on the
sheet two and it shows the properties
what are the kind of uh uh worksheet
that we have the page breaks the right
to left whether it is enabled or not the
name of the sheet and so on whether it's
visible and things like
the next thing is the immediate window
and the watch
window now what is the immediate window
immediate window is basically a tool or
a window wherein you can run and execute
simple lines of codes individual Excel
code that you can run it will allow you
to test individual lines which is very
useful and handy when you're writing and
debugging codes uh the output of the uh
line that you execute can be seen here
in the immediate window whereas watch
Window watch window is similar to it but
it displays the value of the watched
expression in its current current state
so this can be extremely useful again
while we are debugging the VBA code
adding a watch is a great utility and
we'll see uh the use the advantages of
having a watch window in your uh VBA
interface so these are the things that
we'll learn and look into it in detail
in the coming section now we continue
our topic for Visual Basic for
application for macros and uh I'm going
to show you how to you know run some
codes and run some macros in the codes
and perform some simple to complex task
using the VBA for MOS so there are two
ways to open the Visual Basic app
application and uh first thing is you
can run alt f11 click on the sheet and
just dis press and it will open the um
Visual Basic for application window or
alternatively you can just go and click
on the Visual Basic and it will open the
sheet for you I mean the code window for
you and as we have discussed before
these are the windows that we see this
is the code window and this is the
project Explorer
and this is the immediate window will we
can run some testing codes immediately
it will show you the output so here we
see the project Explorer window where we
see the mods and all for our Visual
Basic for
applications so as we see the code is
empty here we'll try to record a macro
and see uh how the code develops okay so
I just go here and click uh record macro
and I save it
as
format and
[Music]
columns okay this Qui and I just save it
click okay and it is started recording
so now what I'll do is I make it simple
and I just delete some columns
here okay I do not need this I delete
this is there wait I want this I want
the mode of payment parts cost labor
hours I do not want this number of
technici forget
it
okay and I go for the left and see what
all do I need I need I don't need this I
delete all these
and I just expand this so that it's
clearly
visible and then I want to change the
format I mean the font so I select
this and I change it to time
room
okay I go back to my developer tab click
stop recording it is
saved
okay now I go back to my
code and see the macro here so we see
the macro here and we can see or in
detail what it looks like so we see the
code what it's doing and what the macro
run has generated the code with so we
see we have basically the name of the
macro is format columns and what it is
doing we just selecting The Columns
and deleting some we are checking the
range on some columns e e select that is
the E column that we have select
selected and then again so on and the
next thing is the font selection that is
mentioned we are changing it to Times
New Roman size is 11 so it is basically
a basic VBA code so it starts with a sub
and it should end with m sub so this is
the code or format of the VBA code that
it looks like and we'll try to do some
basic functions with the VBA and discuss
this in further te details so for ease
of explanation I have picked up a blank
uh spreadsheet and uh I'll try to
explain some basic uh functions and the
commands and the codes that we use to
accomplish the task that we with
weba so as we see this is the blank
sheet and I have selected a new module
for
it so here I uh start the code and as it
says it starts with
and I am specifying the the module name
as number so I'll just try to make it
quite simple and you know so we as soon
as we enter the sub it it sends with the
end sub and so this is the uh start of
the code and this is the end of the code
and whatever is there should be here and
this is the name of the code of the
macro now uh I'll explain it further
about the GM statement why is it used
and what does it use for
so dim is basically a keyword which is
the a short form of Dimension and it is
used to declare a variables in the VBA
so here I am trying to specify uh a
variable called X and how I'm going to
do it I will as it have it as a number
or an integer or anything so here in
this example I'll put it as an integer
or a number okay and as I put as it
populates the prompts so I select
integer and for example I select the
number to
be
500 okay and here I'm trying to assign a
variable integer a a cell a value of uh
500 with the dim keyword so where
exactly I want to put this you will see
it when you execute the code okay range
I am selecting it should be under codes
where I'm going to put the value of x as
and I close the backet and what should
be the
value we will value should be X so now
as I click run sub or you can do it with
the by running the alt or F5 key and it
will run the code so you see here in the
Excel sheet it executes the value of the
cell B5 to be 500 so this is one simple
function that you can do with the uh
Dimension keyboard or dim
keyword and you can assign the value as
integers now proceed we proceed further
with certain more example some more
examples and how we assign the string
value as a as a text or something else
okay now I'm going to show you what dim
can be executed you me used as to set
variables te can be used as a uh double
where double is basically a longer form
of single variable it usually takes more
space but uses uh needs more larger
numbers okay and then you can
set double and I just uh don't specify
it and you can use statee it basically
stores the date values okay and then
again string so what string does if you
use string it stores the text it can
contain numbers it will have some text
as calculations or anything can be
performed so these are the basic thing
that I will cover
and you can also use different uh values
for it so I will discuss this in the
next
example
okay so in the next example I'll try to
sub or use a string value for it and I
put it as string sub
string
so
value this is my name so as soon as I
hit enter it ends with the inser prompt
and now I can I get my code so I put as
dbook as
[Music]
string okay now
I'm trying to use uh uh uh to name a
country or put a value of a country to
one of the celles so let's see how it
goes and I select country and in country
I select
America okay now what is the value or
the cell that basically takes the or we
will put the name of the country as so I
have to specify a range and as soon as I
hit it goes and I have to specify
the the cell here so here I put it as
G and uh P okay so I close
it and I put a value to what value I am
going to assign it is a
country
okay now I try to WR this code by simply
and see G4 the name populates as a
country here so this is a dim keyword
being used as a string in our VBA code
so uh we can also use uh VBA to you know
pop up a message or an alert or a kind
of a button or a message pop up pops up
when you execute this code so this
basically can be uh executed using uh
the code here which I'm going to
put and we use
the okay let's give it a
value I'm going to name it as double
value and again the name keyword I'm
going to use the keyword as double okay
why double is used is basically uh it
gives a longer it can be used for a
longer form of single variable takes it
usually takes more space and larger
numbers and we'll try to assign it okay
now I'm going to pop up a message in the
which says value of a is so and so so
I'm going to give value of a
as
25 okay and how it pops up a message
okay so there is a message
box which you know can be used and it
will give you a value I mean uh it will
prompt you to enter the value what kind
of button you want and you you can enter
the text and you can enter the value so
here I'm going to uh write a code which
you know which gives a popup message a
message box saying that the value of a
is so and
so value of a is I'm going to put it in
in percent code so it actually takes the
value of e okay now that's it and let's
try to run this and you will see a
message box popping message box popping
up okay so the value of the message box
pops up saying the value of a is 250
so in the next example I am going to
write a code where in you know you can
give a value or a string you can assign
it to a selected cell and this basically
used when you have some you know when
you have a a task of you know giving a
value to a particular cell or you have
to assign a text or say something about
a report okay so this let's see how it
goes and we use the
I will say it
as fun with some
procedures this is the name and again
dim so here I am giving to I'm going to
give a user input and it will be as a
string okay you can give any I mean any
string or any statement what my user
input will be I will define it
[Music]
here
course this is the report for a let's
make it
simple okay and where I'm going to put
it is in the active cell or the cell
that
I have it select okay what will be the
value
the value will be the user
input I have defined user input as this
is a report for VBA so this cell turns
into you this is a report for
VBA I run this and you see
this so in some cases you need to run
this and you know it makes life quite
simple when you use PBA for this as we
have seen before we have use message box
now I'm going to use the same message
box uh to display my name or you can use
it to display your name so let's see how
it goes I'm going to name it as
name okay and it's very simple you have
to define a message
box which displays your
name and I'm going to put it under codes
that my name is is
f and we'll try to run
[Music]
it see
here so it pops a a message saying that
my name is it fan so this is a message
box that you can display and I can do
anything with
[Music]
this this is a PBA
[Music]
six okay I run it again and it pops this
message so these are the things that you
can use to customize or you know when
you open an Excel sheet or try to run a
workshop or a report and it pops up a
message customary welcome messages that
you can customize or you know Define a
sheet
report or kind of data in it and this
can be used using uh run using the
message
box now I have another good example
wherein you know you can write a code to
tell Excel what is the value of uh a
cell or what is the number that is there
in the cell so here it is I put it a
sub okay number
and it will again populate a message
box which we set it
to
the the
entered value e and it should tell
me which or I specify which cell it is
that we are going to find the value of
okay so I give a range
of I have to give it in codes I'm going
to code
completed and it should tell me the
value of the number that is present in
the cell
E1
okay it ends let's try to run it
run it and it will give me the value so
this is how we can use Excel to
determine or show or populate a message
box which will give us the value of the
uh number that is there in the cell so
here I can change it
to a
4 as well and try to run it and it will
give me the number so this is simple way
of you know populating a message box
which will tell us the
value of
a uh let me show you one more simple
example where in a message box pops up
or a welcome message that can be po set
when you open the uh Excel or worksheet
so so let's uh name it as
Auto
open and then again message box I want
it to populate and what does it say
I put it in codes
Welcome to
our
worksheet of
Workshop it's very simple you just run
it
and see it pops up a message saying
welcome to a workshop so these are the
one more this is one more way where you
can you know run a code uh to simple
welcome message on
Excel next I'm going to show you a code
where in you can give a value or assign
a value to a particular cell by
simple
curve so we name it as add
value now I specify the range I mean
where I'm going to specify a
cell where the Val value will be given
to the cell now I'm going to give it as
V5 okay I put it in codes close the
parenthesis what is the value that I'm
going to give value
equals
250 okay so now with this code I mean
I'm going to assign a value of 250 to
the cell B5 let's see
run it
see again I do it to
10
okay so this is how you can assign a
value to a particular
cell now I can run uh the same thing and
give a range of cells I mean let me make
it very simple here
I give it as
B1 through
b five
as 450 so let's see what it does see
here I'm going I'm specifying the range
to be B1 through B5 so it is doing it
for the whole range
okay and
then and then I can give a another set
of range here like uh let me specify
it range to
be
C1 I have to give it a course it will
give me an error C1
colon
C4 and I separate it with a comma and I
can specif another range so the next one
will be
D1 2
D4 and then I close the codes close the
parenthesis what is the value that I
give
is let's
say 2 three
0 and I try to run it so it gives the
value of C1 through C4 and D1 through D4
as 230 as be specified in the code so
this is one of one more example wherein
you can assign values to
the uh so range of cells or cells with
the
BBA one more thing I can U you know
assign a value to a particular cell by
specifying these cells it's very simple
just specify the cells like uh6
Comm s
okay and I close the
parenthesis I assign a value to it value
equals 10 let's
see see here it assigns the value to
that particular cell that we have
specified row six and column 7 okay so
this is one more uh example wherein you
can assign values to particular cells
okay in the next example uh there will
be a scenario where in you need to
select a range of cells in the sheet so
this can also be done this task can also
be performed using vpa so I will show
you
how this is
our let's say
select
range okay and
uh and I I'm going to set a dim variable
as a example okay let's say it as
example and what I'm doing is I'm
specifying a range because I need to
select a range of cells okay now I'm
going to set the variable
as set example where I'm going to define
the range of the cells that should be
selected so let's say a one
five okay this will be the
selection and what I'm going
to set the value okay I am going to set
a value
example I'm going to give it a value of
256 so let's see how it pans
out okay so here I'm selecting a set of
cells a range of cells and I'm going to
assign a value with this function so
this makes it quite simple and this will
be used in a regular daily task where
you know there is where would be a
scenario where in you have to select a
set of cells and give give a value to it
so you can do it with a click of a
button with the vpa now I can simply
tweak this with the you know by just
selecting it so there
is I'll remove
this and instead of assigning a value I
just put an option to select
it now let's just run it and see what
happens
next okay so this is one way of you know
just selecting it okay and then it's it
becomes easier for you to copy paste and
do some functions in so you can select
this and you can assign a value and you
can also give a set of values to a
particular range or cells with these
codes now what if I want to do a
selection of the same rows and columns
in the next sheet and I can do this with
the set of another set of command so I
will show you how so here let's say you
know we set the same thing and we
specify the worksheets okay worksheets
I want it in sheet two okay so I just
put it as sheet two and I activate it
basically activating it and now I'm
going to specify the
worksheet two and what is the range that
I'm going to select the same thing okay
the range will
be
A1 to D5
okay what I'm going to do I'm going to
select
it okay and see what happens
here okay pink so here I am selecting
the worksheet to and I'm activating it
and I'm going to assign range and I'm
going to select it so I can just copy
the same or select the same set of cells
in the next sheet okay now when there
will be as I said There Will will be you
know a requirement where you need to
copy some cell contents and paste it to
another location so how you do that it's
again a simple code that you can write
and let's
say let's say it as copy and paste I'm
just making it simple by giving
something that we can understand and
relate
[Music]
copy
paste okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to select this range and I'm
going to copy it and paste it somewhere
here okay so let me just remove this and
I'll show you how first we have to
specify the range where you want to copy
the cells okay so let's say it is again
A1 should be in codes
call
[Music]
D5
for and I am going to select it okay
then what I'm going to do is uh once you
select this the selection that you have
should what should be the function and I
am going to specify the selection and
the function should be copying it okay
so I just uh set that and where I'm
going to paste it so I have to now
specify the range where I have to paste
this selection and you can just mention
the column here uh let's say
G uh
10 okay and close
it I'm going to select it and then where
I'm going to paste it I can do it in
this sheet okay active sheet
and paste so we are selecting a range of
cells selection and that selection what
we are doing is we will copy it and now
we are going to specify the range where
you going to select it and then paste it
quite simple let's
it okay
see
and you can just change it to so it is
visible on
this
G5
okay so this makes uh quite easy and you
can run it uh the next scenario will be
like when you need to get the count of
the number of cells like you have to
have a selection and you need to count
the number of cells so this can also be
done and it's quite easy I am going to
show it to you
let's say the
subb
count
SS should always be relatable so that
you know you remember and you understand
what is the output and why you're using
it and I'm going to set a variable let's
say I'm going to set an example for this
and what we going to do is we are going
to specify a range first okay we we will
specify the range of the cells that we
have going to that we need to count
basically so I'm going to set a variable
as a range and then what we going to do
is
example and we specify the range
here you can specify the range or your
selection where you count the where you
need the count of the number of cells so
E1 col d
this is n now how you want the output
you want it you want a message box to
pop out so you will set a message
box
and what should it give will give you
the count of the variable that is the
variable is here is examples okay so it
will count the number of cells in this
area
okay U let's see it
says okay here I think I missed it so I
just specify the number here and let's
see so it gives you the number of count
and this 20
okay now let's see I want
to
six so it gives you the selection so
it's quite simple it will be very useful
in our daily task and VAR you need to
count the number of cells so this is one
way to get it well I can further tweak
this and to determine the or to count
the number of rows or columns so it's
again very simple I just need to do some
changes here I have to set
the column
count so if I want to calculate the
number of columns
just count let's see how it it should
calculate or give the message the number
of columns here see it gives there are
five columns okay 1 two 1 2 3 4 5 okay
so it gives us the number of columns
here if I change it to should give
me four
po okay similarly you can count the
number of rows
here just change it to
rows see says six rows out
there
okay should give
me see so this way you can calculate the
number of uh count the number of uh
cells number of columns number of rows
with
this the next thing I'm going to talk
about is the if statement if statement
is one of the most widely used statement
and whoever is in programming are very
much familiar with this function so what
it does is we specify a condition if a
condition is met then the out output
should be such and such we can specify
the condition and it will check whether
that condition is there and if it is uh
spec mean if it is achieved then you
will have to specify the output as well
so this can be achieved with the if
statement okay and it is very easy
because it is it understand the basic uh
English language so it's not very
complicated and I'll show you how so the
syntax can be like this if suppose you
specify a condition and if that
condition is met then the result you
specify the condition and the result
both okay so this is one thing and then
you can specify the else or else
condition where you know you specify the
condition two then the result should
be
this so here you are going to specify
two conditions or multiple conditions
wherein you specify
this and if it is there then result will
be this if it is this condition and then
the result will be something else let's
take an example wherein you have to you
have some scores or
marks and you have to select the result
you can't do this manually entering so
just you can write a code suppose for
example I have it here
okay
let's and I specify
as
if
statement okay now I have to specify the
variables now I have two variables I
have a score and I have
result and the score is an integer the
number and the result is a string pass
or fail so I specify this okay
dim
score I specify it as integer okay and
then there's another variable that I
have to set
result
as
string okay
now what the score will be the score I
have to specify the range score I'm
giving it as a range I mean
the it's in
my cell
A1
okay I specify the range what is it it
is a
value
okay
sorry should be a doct
okay and then I'm specifying a condition
here
if score Val the
variable is greater than or equal so as
I said it's quite simple and it takes
the basic English uh language
functions
then the result result is another
variable that I have said result what it
should be it should be in codes
pass okay so if this condition is met
then the result will be this okay and
now where I want to specify my result I
should give a range for that as well so
I give it in the next column or
anyone this is the basic uh
example value should be the
result okay let's see how
see say
SP change it to
40 it doesn't give me anything because I
have specified only one condition here
okay 75 let's see have
see so this say it's very basic
condition that you are specifying you
are specifying two variables the score
and the result and then you are giving a
value for it and you are specifying the
condition if the score is greater than
then the result should be
pass now in the next uh section uh we
will simply twg this and use an if then
else statement we'll t an L statement
with it and see we'll specify another
condition and see so here again we'll
use two variables that is the score as
integer and the result as a string and
let's uh stick to the same
values now um I'm going to specify it
and if the score is greater than
60 then the
result so the result will be pass as it
is before and then
I'm going to specify another condition
else the result should
be should
be
three okay and now I have to put it as a
end if statement I have to specify the
ends and the result will be again in the
value I mean the range will be V1 so
let's see if it is more than 60 then it
is pass otherwise it is
fail okay it is pass let's see 40
and it
again okay so we are specifying two
variables again we are giving it a range
and we are specifying one condition if
this condition is met the result is
passed otherwise else it is fail so
another set of
example uh the next uh statement that we
use uh or we going to discuss is the
loop statement that is the for Loop
statement and why we use it there are
there are situations and uh task that
you need to execute and you need to do
it several number of times these are
basically executed sequentially it means
one after another so the first statement
or the function is executed and the next
is taken up so and then the next and so
on so these uh loop statements allow us
to execute a statement or a group of
statements multiple number of times many
number of times and this happens only
when the first task or the first uh task
is done and it executes that and it goes
to the next one so here we'll discuss a
simple example of the uh for Loop
statement
so let's see how it works and I'm going
to set up a loop statement okay again
the I'm going to make it as Loop one so
here it is I have to specify the uh
variable that is
dim and I'm going to specify X as an
integer okay I'll try to execute it and
then explain it what happens and how it
executes okay for X = to 1 1
2 24 okay let's see and I'm going to
specify the
range range as so what I'm going to do
is basically I'm going to fill the
column A from 1 to 24 with some value
from 1 to 24 with the values of 1
through 24 okay so I'm setting up a
range
and How It Ends is it gives me a
value now it executes this and goes to
the next so I'll explain you how so we
are setting up a loop we are setting up
a integer a variable X as integer and we
are setting the value of x to be 1 to 24
so here for one it executes the first
thing is it it takes X as one and it
fills in A1 and then the next value of x
will be 2 and it goes to A2 and fills
the value as 2 so just let's try to
execute this and you will see the row
column A filled with 1 through
24 see it's quite simple it executes one
condition and then goes to the next and
we are defining it with the number of
values and the variable as X and the
number of values is 1 to be
24 okay so this is one basic example of
a for Loop
statement uh now let's do some more uh
addition to this uh uh example by you
know executing another set of for Loop
and giving the output and we'll code the
output to be the color coded once in the
column B so how we do it it's a basic
simple example that I'm going to take
and again what I'm going to do is I will
have this values here and I'm going to
color code the B column with certain
color index for each number there will
be a different color so let's see and
what I'm going to do is I'm only going
to change the
B and what action is going here we put
up a value now we going to select it and
with this selection what I'm going to do
is it should select it and it should
color the interior with
what with the color index
okay and the value of
x and then I'm going to specify the
pattern what uh pattern it will take for
the box to be colored and I'm going
going to put it as a
solid it will fill the whole thing with
the
solid and then I just execute it see it
takes
this color B and it's code it like this
so these are the simple things that you
can set up with the codes and for Loop
statements so there are numerous
examples and exercises that we can
perform task we can perform with the
BBA and uh this can be uh found in
detail now next courses Advanced courses
and now if you're aspiring business
analyst then try giving a shot to Simply
lears postgraduate program and business
analytics from P University in
collaboration with IBM the course Link
in the description and pin comment
should take you to the program being
offered So currently I am on my MySQL
workbench let me connect to the local
instance so I'll give my password
I'll click on okay all right so this is
my MySQL workbench query editor so first
we are going to learn subqueries let me
give a
comment and write
subqueries all right so first of all
let's understand what a subquery is so a
subquery is a query within another SQL
query that is embedded within the where
Clause from clause or having
Clause so we'll explore a few scenarios
where we can use subqueries so for that
I'll be using my database that is SQL
intro so I'll write my command use SQL
unor intro now this database has a lot
of tables I'll be using the employees
table that is present inside SQL intro
Let me just expand this and you can see
here we have an employees table so let
me first show you the contents within
this table I'll write select star from
employe
EMP let me execute it okay you can see
here we have the employee ID employee
name age gender there's date of join
Department City and salary and we have
information for 20 employees if I scroll
down you can see there are 20 employees
present in our table so let's say you
want to find the employees whose salary
is greater than the average salary in
such a scenario you can use a subquery
so let me show you how to write a
subquery I'll write the select
statement in the select statement I'll
pass my column names that I want to
display so the column names I want are
the employee name then I want the
department of the employee and the
salary of the employee from my table
name that is
employees next I'll use a where
condition
where my salary should be greater than
the average salary of all the employees
so I'll write salary greater than after
this I'm going to write my subquery so
I'll give
select average of salary from my table
name that is employees and I'll close
the bracket and give a
semicolon so what it does is first it is
going to find the average salary of all
the employees that are present in our
table
once we get the average salary number
we'll use this wear condition where
salary is greater than the average
salary number
so the inside subquery let me run it
first if I run this this gives you the
average salary of all the employees
which is
$75,500
now I want to display all the employees
who have salary greater than
75,500 $ so let's run our
subquery there you go so there are eight
employees in our table who have a salary
greater than the average salary of all
the
employees all right next let's see
another
example suppose this time you want to
find the employees whose salary is
greater than John's
salary so we have one employee whose
name is
John let
me run the table once
again okay if I scroll down you see we
have an employee as John you see this
our employee ID 116 is John and his
salary is
$67,000 I want to display all the
employees who salary is greater than
John's salary so basically all the
employees who are earning more than 65
,000 I want to print them so let's see
how to do it I'll
write
select I want the employee name comma
the gender of the
employee I also want the department and
salary from my table name that is
employees I'll write
where salary is greater
than I'll start my
opening bracket inside the bracket I'm
going to give my inner query that is
Select
salary from
employees
where the employee name is John So
within single quotations I'll give John
as my
employee I'll end with a
semicolon so let me first run my inner
query so this will give us the salary
that John has which is
$67,000 now I want the employees who are
earning more than
$67,000 so let's run our
subquery okay so you can see 12 rows
returned which means there are 12
employees in our table who are earning
more than
$67,000 you see here all these employees
have a salary greater than
$67,000 okay
now you can also use
subqueries with two different tables so
suppose you want to display some
information that are present in two
different tables you can use subqueries
to do that
so for this example we'll use a database
that is called classic models you can
see the first
database so let me use this database
called classic models I'll write use
classic models
now this database was actually
downloaded from the internet there's a
very nice website I'll just show you the
website name so this is the website that
is MySQL tutorial.org you can see here
they have very
nice articles blogs from where you can
learn my SQL in detail so we have
downloaded the database that is classic
models from this website you see here
they have a MySQL sample database if you
click on this it will take you to the
link where you can download the database
so they have this download link which
says download my SQL sample database and
the name of the database is classic
Models All right so we are going to use
this classic models database throughout
our demo session if I expand the tables
section you can see there are a lot of
tables that are present inside this
classic models t we have Cricket
customers there's employees office
there's orders order lines and many more
so for our subquery we'll be using two
tables that is order details and
products table first let me show you the
content that is present
inside the products table
first if I run this you see here it says
110 rows returned which means there are
110 different products that are present
in our table which has the product code
the product name product line we have
the product vendor description quantity
and stock Buy price
MSRP the other table we are going to use
is order details which has the details
of all the
orders let me show you the
records order details tables has okay so
there are thousand records present in
this table table you have the order
number the product code quantity ordered
price of each item you have the order
line number as well okay
now we want to know the product code the
product name and the MSRP of the
products whose price of each product is
less than $100 for this scenario we are
going to use two different tables and we
are going to write a
subquery
Okay so if you see here in the order
details table we have a column called
price each I want to display the product
code the product name and the MSRP of
the products which have a price of each
product less than
$100 so the way I'm going to do is I'll
write
select product code
comma product name now one thing to
remember that this product name is
actually present inside our products
table and product code is present in
both the tables that is products and
Order details here you can see this is
the product code column comma MSRP which
is present inside the products table
again from my table that is
products
where I'll
write
product
code I'm going to use the in
operator next I'll write my inner query
that is Select
product code from my table order
details
where my price of each
product is less than
$100 let me run
this okay so you can see there are total
83 products in our table which
have a price less than $100 you can see
the price
here
okay now we learn another Advanced
Concept in SQL which is known as stored
procedures I'll just give a comment
saying stored
procedure
okay so first let's understand what is a
store procedure a stored procedure is an
SQL code that you can save so that the
code can be reused over and over
again so if you want to write a query
over and over again save it as a stored
procedure and then call it to execute
it so in this example I want to create a
stored procedure that will return the
list of players who have scored more
than six goals in a tournament so I have
a database called SQL IQ these are a few
databases that I've already created so
this database has a table called players
if I expand the tables option you see we
have a table called players and you can
see the columns player ID the name of
the player the country to which the
player belongs to and the number of
goals each player has scored in a
particular tournament so I'll write a
store procedure that will return the
list of top players who have scored more
than six goals in a tournament so first
of all let me Begin by using my SQL IQ
database we'll run
it so now we are inside the SQL IQ
database let
me
select star from players to show
the values that we have in the players
table you can see there are six players
in our
table we have the player ID the names of
the players the country to which these
players belong to and the goals they
have
scored so I'll write a stored
procedure so the stored procedure syntax
is something like this it should start
with a D
limiter okay in the D limiter I'll write
Amberson
Amberson next I I'll write
create
procedure followed by the procedure name
let's say I want to name my procedure as
topor
players next statement is
begin after begin I'll write my select
statement I want to select the name of
the
player the country
and the goals each player has
scored from my table that is
players
where I'll write goals is greater than
six we give a
semicolon then I'll end
my procedure with a DM that was double
Amberson next
I'll write
dmit and give a
semicolon now the semicolon
suggests this is a default
delimiter there should be a space
okay now let's run our stored
procedure there you go so you have
successfully created a store procedure
now the way to run a store procedure is
you need to use the call method and give
the procedure name that is topor players
in our case with brackets and a
semicolon let's execute it okay there is
some problem
here so we made a mistake while creating
a procedure the name of the column is
goals and not
goal let me create that procedure again
okay it says the procedure topor player
already exists let's
just edit the procedure name instead of
top player we'll write it as top players
and similarly we'll edit here as well
now let's create it
again okay now to call my procedure I'll
write call space followed by the
procedure name which is top _ players if
I run this you can see we have two
players in our table who have scored
more than six goals so we consider them
as the top players in a particular
tournament all
right now there are other methods that
you can use while creating a stored
procedure one of the methods is by using
an in parameter so when you define an in
parameter inside a stored procedure the
calling program has to pass an argument
to the stored
procedure so I'll give a
comment stored procedure using in
parameter all right so for this example
I'll create a procedure that will fetch
or display the top records of employees
based on their
salaries so if we have a
table in our SQL IQ database which is
called employee
details I'm going to use this table you
can see we have the name of the employee
the age sex then we have the date of
join City and salary using this table
I'll create a procedure that will fetch
or display the top records of employees
based on their
salaries and we'll use the in parameter
so let me show you how to do it I'll
write
delimiter this time I'm going to use
forward
slash I'll write
create
procedure followed by the procedure name
let's say SP St procedure sort by salary
is the name of my procedure and inside
this procedure I'll give my
parameter in I'll create a variable V
and assign a data type
integer then I'll write
begin followed by my select statement
where I'll select the name
AG
salary
from my table name that is
EMP details or employee
details I'm going to order this
by salary
descending
and I want to display limited number of
Records so I'm using
this limit keyword and my variable V
which I created
here I end my select statement
I'll end my stor procedure
with forward
slash and I'll go back to my default
delimiter that is
semicolon all
right so let me run
this there should be a space here all
right so let's run
this okay you can see we have
successfully created our second store
proced procedure which is Spore sort by
salary now you can also check whether
the St procedure was created or not here
you have an option to see the stored
procedures let me just refresh
this and you can see we
have three stored procedures that we
have created so far one is sp Spore sort
by salary the other two where topor
player and topor players okay now now
let's call our stored procedure I'll
write call space followed by the stored
procedure name which is
Spore
sort by
salary and inside this I'll give my
parameter which was actually V and this
V we have used in limit let's say I want
to display only the top three records of
the employees who have the top three
highest salaries
okay so let me run
it there you go so ammy Sara and Jimmy
were the top three employees who have
the highest salary so you saw how you
could use the in parameter in a stored
procedure we created a variable and that
variable we used in our select statement
and we called our stor procedure and
passed in that
variable okay
now instead of a select statement inside
a stored procedure you can also use
other statements let's say
update so I'll create a stored procedure
to update the salary of a particular
employee so in this procedure instead of
Select statement we'll use the update
command in this example we'll use the in
operator twice so let me show you how to
do it I'll write my D limit meter first
which is going to be forward slash then
I'll write
create
procedure my name of the procedure is
going to be update
salary and inside the update salary name
I'll write
in and then
temp underscore name which will be a
temporary name variable and the type
I'll assign is varar
20 I'll again use my in parameter I'll
write
in
next my other variable would be newcore
salary and the data type would be
float I'll write
begin and write my update command or
update statement I'll write
update table name that is a employee
details
set
salary equal
to newcore
salary
where name is equal
to my temporary variable that is tempore
name so this is my update command and
I'll end the delimiter
all right so let's run
this okay we have successfully created
our stored procedure if I refresh this
you can see I have my stored procedure
update uncore
salary okay now let's
say first of all
I'll display my records that are present
inside
employee _ details table okay so we have
six rows of information let's say you
want to update the salary of employee
Jimmy or let's say Mary from 70,000 to
let's say
72,000 or let's say 880,000 so I'll call
my stored procedure that is update
uncore salary and this time I'm going to
pass in two parameters the first
parameter will be the employee name and
next with a comma I'll give my new
salary that I want
to so my employee name let's say is
Mary and the salary I want to be updated
is let's say
$80,000 I'll give a
semicolon and I'll run it you can see it
says is one row affected now let's check
our table once again there you go if you
see this record for Mary we have
successfully updated the salary to
$880,000
now moving ahead we learn to create a
stored procedure using the out parameter
so I'll give a
comment stored procedure using out
parameter okay so suppose we want to get
the count of total female employees
we will create total employees as an
output parameter and the data type would
be an integer the count of the female
employ is assigned to the output
variable which is total _ emps using the
into keyword let me show you how to
write a stored procedure using the out
parameter so first I'll declare my
delimiter to forward slash I'll
write
create procedure
followed by the procedure name it is
going to be
Spore
account
employees and inside this I'm going to
give my out parameter and the variable
name that is total uncore emps which is
total employees and the data type will
be integer next I'm going to write begin
followed by my select statement that is
Select I want the count of total
employees and the output I'm going to
put into my new variable that is total
uncore
emps from my table that is
empore
details where
sex is equal to F which means
female I'll give a
semicolon next I'll end
it with the D limiter and I'm going to
change the D limiter to a default D
limiter that is
colon so let me tell you what I'm doing
here I'm creating a new stored procedure
that is Spore count employees using this
stored procedure I'm going to count the
total number of female employees that
are present in our table empore details
so I've used my out parameter and I'm
creating a new variable called total _
emps the data type is integer here in
the select statement I'm counting the
names of the employees and the result
I'm storing it in total _
emps I have used my wear condition where
the gender of the sex is
female so let's run
this okay so we have created our stored
procedure let's refresh this okay you
can see we have our new stored procedure
Spore count
employees
now to call it I'll write
call the name of the procedure that is
countor Spore count
employees within brackets I'll pass in
the parameter as at the rate f _
EMP I'll give a semicolon then I'll
write
select at the rate
fcor EMP as female
employees okay so as is an alas name
let's run this one by one first I'll
call my procedure and then we'll display
the total number of female employees you
can see in our table we have three
female employees
all right now with this understanding
let's move on to our next Topic in this
tutorial on Advanced SQL now we are
going to learn about triggers in
SQL so I'll give a comment here triggers
in
SQL so first let's understand what is a
trigger so a trigger is a special type
of stored procedure that runs
automatically when an event occurs in
the database server there are mainly
three types of triggers in SQL we have
the data manipulation trigger we have
the data definition trigger and login
triggers in this example we'll learn how
to use a before insert trigger so we
will create a simple students table that
will have the students role number the
age the name and the students marks so
before inserting the records to our
table we'll check if the marks are less
than zero so in case the marks are less
than zero our trigger will automatically
set the marks to a random value let's
say
50 so let's go ahead and create our
table that is
students all
right so I'll write
create
table
student now this table will have the
student rle
number the data type is
integer it will have the age of the
students again the data type is integer
we have the names of the students so the
third column would be
name the data type would be variable or
varying
character size I'm giving it as 30
finally we have the marks as floating
type so let's create this table which is
student so we have created our
table
now I'll write
my trigger command so trigger command
will start with D limiter like how our
usual stored procedures
have
next this time I'll write create
trigger then you need to give the
name of the trigger that is Mark
underscore let's say
verify I'm going to use a before insert
trigger so I'll write before
insert on my table name that is
student next I'll write for each
row
if new do
marks is less than
Z
then we'll
set new DOT marks equal to
50 so this is
my condition first we'll check before
inserting if any student has marks less
than zero we'll assign a value 50 to
that student because usually the marks
are not less than zero in any exam
I'll write end if semicolon and I'll
close the dmit so this is
my trigger command I'll run it it says
trigger already exists in this case we
need to update the trigger name let's
say I'll write maxor verify
uncore student for
STD let's run it again
okay there is an error here because in
our table the column name is Mark and
not marks so here we need to change it
as Mark instead of marks all right let's
run
it okay so we have created our
trigger
now let me insert a few records to the
student table so I'll write insert into
student I'll write
values we give the values as 501 which
is the student role number the age is
let's say 10 the name is it's a
Ru and the marks is let's say
75.0 give a comma we'll insert our
second student
record student role number is 50
2 age is
12 the name is let's say
Mike and this time I'm purposely giving
a value of minus
20.5 give another comma we'll insert the
third
record for student role number
503 age is
13 the name is
Dave
and let's say the marks obtained by Dave
is 90
now we'll insert our final record for
student
number
504 the age is
10 name I'll enter as
Jacobs and this time again I'm purposely
giving the marks in
negative 12 let's say
5 close the bracket and give a semicolon
and I'll run my insert statement okay so
we have inserted four rows of
information to our student
table
now let me run the select query I'll
write select star from
student if I run this you see the
difference there you go so originally we
had
inserted for 502 the marks was minus
20.5 and for
504 for Jacobs the marks was -
12.5 our trigger automatically converted
the negative marks to 50 because when we
created our trigger we had set our marks
to 50 in case the marks were less than
zero so this is how a trigger
works now you can also drop a trigger or
delete a trigger you can just write drop
trigger followed by the tri trigger name
in this case our trigger name
is maxor verore
St I'll just paste this
here and if you run this it will
automatically delete your trigger we
give this as a
comment
okay now moving
on now we are going to learn about
another crucial Concept in SQL which is
very widely used this is known as as
views so views are actually virtual
tables that do not store any data of
their own but display data stored in
other tables views are created by
joining one or more
tables I'll give a comment as views in
SQL
okay now to learn views I'm going to use
my table which is present inside classic
models database now this database as I
mentioned we had downloaded we had
downloaded it from the internet so first
of all let me write
use classic models so I'll switch my
database
first all right now we are inside
classic models so here let me show you
one of the tables which is called
customers so I'll write select star from
customers okay I missed s
here let's run it again
so this is my customer table which is
present inside classic models database
it has the contact last name the contact
first name the customer name customer
number we have the address State country
and other
information now I'll write a basic view
command using this customer table the
way to write is I'll write create
view followed by The View name which is
cust _ details
then you write
as select I'm going to select a few
column names from my original customer
table which is this one so I need the
customer name let's say I need the phone
number and the city so you have this
information here you have the phone
number and the
city all right I'll write from my table
that is customers
if I run this my view that is cust
details will be
created let's run it there's some error
here because the name of the table is
customers and not customer I'll give an
S and I'll run it
again all right so you can see we have
created our
view and to display the contents that
are present inside our view I can write
select star from followed by The View
name that is ccore
details let's run
it there you go so we have the customer
name the phone number and the City of
the different customers that we have in
our table all
right now let's learn how you can create
views using joins so we'll join two
different tables and create a view so
for that I'm going to use my
products table and the products lines
table I'm talking about the products
table and the product lines table
present inside classic models database
so before I start let me display
the records that are present inside the
products
table let's run it so these are the
different products you can see
here now let's see what we have in
product lines table
so we have the product line the text
description and there's some HTML
description and image so I'll create a
view by joining these two tables and
we'll fetch specific records that are
present in both the tables so let me
first start by writing create view
followed by The View name that is
product
underscore
description as I'll write
select product name comma then I'll
write
quantity in
stock I also want the MSRP now these
three columns are present inside the
products table and next from the product
lines table I want the text description
of the products so I'll write
from products
table I'll give an alas as
P followed by Inner join my other table
that is product lines as let's say PL
on the common column that is product
line so P
dot product
line is equal to
I'll give a space PL do product
line okay so here we have used an inner
join to fetch specific columns from both
the tables and our view name is
productor description let us run it all
right so we have our view ready now let
me view or display what is present
inside our productor description
view I add select star
from productor
description let's run
it there you go so we have the product
name the quantity in stock MSRP and
textual descriptions of the different
products in the
table okay now there are a few other
operations that you can perform let's
say you want to rename of view instead
of productor description you want to
give some other name so I'll just give a
comment rename
description so to rename a description
you can use the rename statement I'll
write rename
table product underscore description
which is
my old
name I I want to change this name to
let's
say I'll give vehicle description since
all our products are related to some of
the other vehicle so I'll write vehicle
description okay let us run
it all right so here you can see I have
renamed
my view so here if I just refresh it and
I'll expand this you can see we have the
Cur details view and we have the vehicle
_ description view
okay now either you can view all the
views from this panel or you can use a
command let's
say I'll write display views is the
comment now to show all the views you
can use
show full
tables where
table
underscore type is equal to within
single code I'll write
view so this is the command that will
display all the views that are present
inside a
database there is
some error here let's debug the error
this should
be okay so instead of table types it
should be table type equal to view let's
run it you can see the two different
View views that we have one is customer
details another is vehicle _
description okay now you can also go
ahead and delete a
view for that you can use the drop
command so I'll write
drop view followed by The View name
let's say I want to delete customer _
details or custor details view I'll
write drop view
castore details
let's run
it you can see here we don't have the
castore details view
anymore all
right now moving to our final section in
this
demo here we will learn about Windows
functions Windows functions were
Incorporated in MySQL in the 8.0
version so Windows fun function in my
SQL are useful applications in solving
analytical problems so using the
employees table present inside my SQL
intro database so we'll find the total
combined salary of the employees for
each
department so first let me switch my
database to
SQL intro
database I'll run it okay I'll display
my table that is employee
so here we have 20 employees in our
table using this
table we are going to find the combined
salary of the employees for each
department so we will partition our
table by department and print the total
salary and this we are going to do using
some windows functions in
MySQL so I'll write
select I want the employee name
the age of the
employee and the department of the
employee comma next I'll
write the sum of
salary
over I want to partition it
by
department so I'll write Partition by
Department which is
DT and I'll give an alas as total salary
so that it will create a new column with
the name total
salary from my table that is
employees the output will be a little
different this time let's execute it and
see the result there you go so here we
have created another column in our
result that is total salary and for each
of the employees and the respective
departments we have the highest salary
so in finance the highest salary of one
of the employees was $155,000
similarly if I come down we have the
highest salary from HR if I scroll
further we have the highest salary from
it marketing product sales and the tech
Team all right now we'll explore a
function which is called row
number now the row number function gives
a sequential integer to every row within
its partition so let me show you how to
use the row number function I'll write
select
rore number
function
over
my column would
be salary so I'll write order by
salary I'll give
the alas as R
num give a
comma and I want to display the employee
name and the salary of the employee from
my table that is
employees and I'll order
by
salary so let's see how our row number
function will create sequential integers
okay you can see here we have a row num
column and we have successfully given
row numbers to each of the records you
can see it starts from 1 and goes up
till
20 okay
now this row number function can be used
to find duplicate values in a table to
show that first I'll create a
table I'll write create
table let's say I'll give a random name
that is
demo and let's say we have in this table
the student ID which is of type integer
and we have the student
name which is of type
varar the size is 20 I'll create
the small table with a few records let's
create this table first now we are going
to insert a few records to our demo
table so I'll write insert
into
demo
values I'll give
101 the name is
Shane give a
comma I'll insert the second student
name one2 the name is Bradley
we give a
comma this time for 103 we have two
records let's say the name of the
student is
hero we give a comma I'll copy
this and we'll paste it again so we have
duplicated
103 next we have
104 the name of the student let's say is
Nathan then again let's say
for the fifth student which is Kevin we
have two
records I'll copy this and I'll paste it
here let me give a semicolon and we'll
insert these records to our table
demo all
right
now let me
just run this table for you I'll write
select star from
demo if you see this we have a few
information that are duplicated in our
table that is for student ID 103 and
student ID
105 now I'm going to use
my row number function to find the
duplicate records present in my table
I'll write select student and _ ID comma
student uncore
name I'll give another comma and write
rore
number
over within
brackets I'll write
Partition
by store
ID comma store name
okay then I'll
write order by store ID close the
bracket I'll give an alas as
ronam from my table that is
demo let's just run
it you can see here okay let me
just delete n from here and do it again
all right if you see here there is just
one student in the name Shane we have
one student in the name Bradley but here
if you see for her the second record it
says two which means there are two
records for her and if I scroll down
there is one record for Nathan and there
are two records for Kevin which means
Kevin is also
repeated okay now we are going to see
another Windows function that is called
rank function in my SQL so the rank
function assigns a rank to a particular
column now there are gaps in the
sequence of ranked values when two or
more rows have the same rank so first of
all let me create a
table and the name of the table would be
a random name we'll give it as let's say
demo one and it will have only
one column let's say variable a of type
integer we'll create this table first
okay now let's go ahead and insert a
few records to
our table which is demo one so I'll
write
value
101
102 let's say 103 is repeated I'm doing
this purposely so that in the output you
can clearly distinguish what the rank
function
does next we have
104 1
5 we have
106 and let's say 106 is also repeated
finally we have
107
okay let me insert these values to my
table that is demo 1 okay this is done
now if I write select
Vore
a and use my rank function I'll write
rank
over then
I'll order by my variable that is Vore
a
as an alas name let's say test
rank
from my table that is demo
one let me execute this and show you how
the rank function
works now if I run this there you go so
here if you
mark So for variable
a101 the test rank is 1 for 102 the test
rank is two but for this value which is
103 the test rank is repeated because
there was a repetition for
103 so we have skipped the rank four
here for 104 the rank is five now for
105 the rank is six now for 106 again
since the record was repeated twice we
have skipped the eighth Rank and our
rank function assigned the same value
which is 7 for 106 and for the last
value 107 the rank is
9 all
right now moving ahead we'll see our
final Windows function which is called
first value
so first value is another important
function in my SQL so this function
Returns the value of the specified
expression with respect to the first row
in the window frame all right so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to
select the employee
name the age and
salary and I'll
write first underscore
value which is my function and pass in
my employee
name and then I'll write
over order
by my column that is salary
descending I'll give an alas as highest
_
salary from my table that is
employees so let me run this and see how
the first underscore value function
works all right so in our table Joseph
was the employee who had the highest
salary which was
$115,000 so the first value function
populated the same employee name
throughout the table you can see it
here now you can also use the first
underscore value function over the
partition so let's say you want to
display the employee name who has the
highest salary in each department so for
that you can use the
partition I'll write select empore name
comma I want the
department and the salary comma I'll use
my function that is first underscore
value followed
by the name of the employee
inside my first value parameter I'll
write
over here I'm going to use partition I'm
going to partition it by department
since I want to know the employee name
who has the highest salary in each
department and I'm going to order
by salary
descending and I'll give my alas again
as highest
salary
from my table that is
employees so let's run this and see the
difference in the output okay so as you
can see here we have the employee who
had the highest salary from each
department so for finance Jack had the
highest salary from HR it was Marcus
similarly in it it was William
if I scroll down for marketing it was
John for product it was Alice who had
the highest salary similarly in sales we
had Joseph and in Tech we had Angela so
this is how you can use the first uncore
value function using
partition all right so that brings us to
the end of this demo session on our
tutorial so let me just scroll through
and show you what we did from the
beginning first we learned about
subqueries in s SQL so we initially
wrote a simple subquery and then we used
our classic models database which was
downloaded from the internet i' also
shown you the link from where you can
download this database here we used two
different tables and we performed a
subquery
operation we learned how to create
stored
procedures so we learned how you can use
the in operator or the in parameter as
well as the out parameter in stored
procedure after stored procedure we
learned another
crucial Concept in SQL which is called
triggers now triggers are also special
kind of store procedures so we saw how
to write a before insert trigger you can
see it
here next we learned how to delete a
trigger we also saw how to work with
views in SQL so views are basically
virtual tables that you can create from
existing
tables we also saw how you can use views
using two different tables and an inner
join and we learned how to display views
how to rename view names how to delete a
view and finally we explored a few
Windows function and now if you're an
aspiring business analyst then try
giving a shot to Simply lears
postgraduate program and business
analytics from P University in
collaboration with IBM the course Link
in the description and pin comment
should take you to the program being
offered in this session we will start
with certain exercises which we will
perform in tblo in order to understand
some basic
concepts now in order to learn tblo the
basic first step is to import a sample
data so in our case what we have done is
we have imported a sample Superstore
which is in Excel format a sample
superstore. excl which has three
worksheets in it orders people and
returns so by importing the this data
into TBL first of all we will create
relationships between these sheets in
order to identify who all have placed
orders and how many people have returned
the orders we will do some analysis on
the orders placed by certain set of
people and Order returned by certain set
of people now as we have imported uh the
sheet we will make certain joins so the
first step is to drag the orders table
the order sheet on the relationship
canvas here okay and you can see the
data sample data the first 100 rows over
here okay then now we need to create an
inner join with people's table between
order and people okay okay so if you
see it has automatically detected the
field names on which the inner joint has
to be created so on the order side you
have region and on the right hand side
which is the people data you have also a
region okay so both these columns are
common and that's how we have made a
joint between orders and people
data so if I close this box and go and
check the people's
data open
so see the region and the person these
two columns from the people table have
now been joined with the orders table
right so it means that these are the
orders in a particular region which has
been placed by in this region
let me show you the sample Superstore
Excel file now this is the structure of
the file you have a sample list of
transactions basically the orders which
are placed by
customers across multiple regions south
west of USA South Region west region
then you have a list of order IDs which
have been returned so
basically the order ID in the returns
sheet matches with those orders in the
orders table and then you have the
people uh sheet in which you have
region and a person associated with that
region the sales person associated with
that region Okay so so basically when we
are combining joining orders with people
we are joining
that which
orders belongs to which region and who's
the salesperson associated with it so
what we have done over here is we have
made a inner join means all the orders
should belong to particular region and
that region is in the people's sheet and
then in the second step now we will make
a
left join between returns and orders not
in a join we'll make a left join between
returns and orders and we will make a
join using the order
ID okay so just edit this
click on left and select order ID as the
join column now what does left join
means left join means is that consider
all the orders from the orders table and
only consider the orders from the
returns table which have data means
which are returned otherwise show null
for the order IDs which are not returned
so if you see this is the these are the
two columns from the returns table and
these are null because this is relevant
to the order IDs which are not returned
okay which has been accepted by the
customer but these are the orders for
which you see data in the returned and
Order ID column it means that these have
been returned now with these joins in
place please save your book and now we
have our relations created in the
um in the table now we are ready to
create certain reports and extract
certain kpis using this relationship
ship
model now we'll move to sheet
one
okay and first we will
place
State and person on the rose sheet
okay then I'll go to
my number
and put the profit or the so per state
per person how much profit I am making
as a company okay this is my goal to
check now sought by highest to lowest so
California is giving me the maximum
profit of 76,6 381 then New York then
Washington so this is the sorted order
in which I
have listed my profit in descending
order now I can also check what are the
number of
orders
placed and check the distinct count
so out of 120 out of the total orders of
127 okay so this is the number of total
number of orders which have been
returned for California is
127 it's 16 29 so the sorted order is as
per the revenue as per the profit and
this is the details of the orders which
have been returned per state
so if you see for Connecticut for a
canas there are zero
returns so you can also extract data
table to refresh is orders and identify
new rows using order date so as in when
new data is being added you
can refresh it now say
extract and now you can save this
information
profit by
State and click save so this is the
extraction of this particular report
which is possible in
tblo so this is the first exercise which
we have completed
for reviewing and analyzing the profit
per state highest to lowest and within
that per state what are the number of
orders which have have been returned by
all the customers the distinct count of
order IDs which have been
returned now let's start our second
exercise on creating calculated fields
in Tabo now in this exercise we will be
doing
certain activities like we will be
creating a set to show the states
which have more than 100 customers then
we will be creating a calculated field
to show an average sales per customer
okay then we will create a calculated
field to show the sales goals and then
show emerging and developing stage so
these are the four kpis which we have to
derive now the first thing we have our
sample super store data already imported
and the relationships created inner join
with people and left join with
returns now we have our sheet two in
which we will create the uh States a
list of states which has more than 100
customers so what we have to do is we
have to click right click on the
customer name and click create
set
okay now we have to give the name as
states with 100 plus
customers and then go to the condition
tab select by
field and then apply condition
as count of customer
name greater than equal
to
100 and click
okay now we have this set created states
with 100 plus
customers now to determine average sales
by customer we have to now create a
calculated field so go to the analysis
and click on create calculate
field
okay now name it as average
sales per
customer and now we will say
average we will use
a okay so we are seeing that per custom
customer we are using a level of
definition function include which means
that per customer what is my average
sales right we've already used a
function aggregated function called
average so we are saying per customer
give me the total and then give me the
average per customer so we're going to
click
okay now create another calculated field
you can also create from here and name
is as name it as sales
goal now in this we are going to type
the formula if
minimum
states with 100 plus customers equal to
true
then some sum of
sales into
1.3
l average sales per customer
into 100 so we we are saying
that if the customer belongs to the set
of states with 100 plus customers then
the sales Target
should be 1.3 times the actual sales as
of today else it should be 100% of the
average sales per
customer now let's create another
calculated field which we call as
emerging or developing
state if distinct
count of customer
name is greater than equal to
100
then the state is tagged as developing
State else it is called
as emerging
State okay so we have now three
calculated Fields average sales per
customer emerging or developing State
and sales goals now we will use this in
our reporting so we will drag sales goal
Under The
Columns and then I'll drop my state so
now this is the statewise sales goal
depending whether the state it has 100
plus customers or
not then add your customer
name make the measure as count
distinct and make it as
distret okay so if you see
this we have
the count of customers per state and the
the sales goal for that particular
State and
now I'll put my sum of sales the total
sales which I want per which is there
per state
now go to show me and
select this particular chart bullet
graph
now to bring sales goals to column right
click on the sales AIS and select swap
reference line
Fields now from the your left hand panel
drag and drop emerging or developing
straight on the color
panel okay so emerging state is the
orange one and the developing state is
the blue one
and save the sheet as developing and the
emerging
States so if you see this it's an
emerging State because it's count is
less than the customer count is less
than
100 its sales goal is
57384 but the actual sales is 1
19511 okay
so now this is a developing State it's
count is greater than equal to 100 and
its sales goal and its sales is exactly
the same it matches so that's why you
are saying the bar and the blue bar is
ending exactly where the vertical bar
is so what we are trying to depict is
that whether the uh state is going
Beyond its Target sales goal or it's
behind it and you can see that using
this particular vertical bar like for
example Michigan its sales goal is 71
952 but its actual sales is
76270 average sales so that's why it is
be above its
Target and it's a developing state
because it has more than 100 customers
so you can even
sort by the count of the uh customers
higher to lower so all your developing
state will group from at the top and the
emerging States Will Group at the
bottom or you can sort
by the sales gold
so the orange bar is the sales goal or
the blue bar so depending what sales
goal is
being derived for each
state hello and welcome to this new
session on tblo now in this session we
will talk about how to prepare
dashboards and how to Interlink reports
within the dashboard so in order to
start this session we will first create
couple of reports and then include them
in the dashboard and then link them
together so for this session as usual we
are using the sample Superstore data set
for our
example now first we will create a
report where we going to show profit by
region per
region so first we will drag the region
in the rows column and we will get all
the regions
and
state so we have all the states per
region in our report now and then we
will
drag sales
and profit so now we have our sales and
profit measures at the column
level now just also drag now the region
to the color section so now we have each
region
colored the entire sales and profit per
region is distinguished by the different
colors Central East South and
West now click on
the colors
now we want to show the labels using the
marks card okay so we want to show the
region okay so we need to include the
show the marks labels just a second
so enable the
labels say show Mark
labels
okay so you have on the left this is the
profit and this is the total sales now
rename this sheet as region and state
analysis
report
okay now let's create another
worksheet now in this sheet just drag
the
state on the
marks card now automatically Tableau
will detect that you know you have
dropped a particular State and we have
the states of United States so it has
identify the state names and showed you
the identifiers of the states on the map
and
automatically identified the latitude
and longitudes which are generated by
Tabo and given you the markers on each
and every state
now drag the sales measure to the color
panel okay so now this is sales per
state in the color scheme with the color
scheming then now Drag The Profit to the
size so now each state you have the
color the the profit and the
sales now you can edit the colors and
you can
select a particular scheme of colors and
say apply and okay so now you are able
to
distinguish the colors on the
state now after this just rename the
sheet as profit by state
report now create let's create another
report now in this report drag the
subcategory to the column
section and sales and profit measures in
the
rows
Okay now click on the right click on the
Su profit pill
and check dual
access now click right click on the
profit axis and say synchronize
access now select some sales from the
card marks card and change the notation
as
bar and for profit change the notation
as line so now this is a fair display
of subcategory
wise sales and profit representation
that these are the sales and what is the
profit
now go to the marks all marks and drag
the category section
the category section as the tool
tip okay so for each and every bar or
line item you should now see the
category
also save your
report and rename this now report as
sales by and profit by subcategory
report now let's create a new
dashboard now the reports which we have
just now created first our dashboard
size let's make it as
automatic okay
then let's show the dashboard title KCK
click on the dashboard
title now drag the reports which you
have
created profit by
state sales and subcategory
report and region
and okay so you have all your three
reports in a single dashboard now
profit by state sales and profit by
subcategory and region by and state
analysis report now we will link these
reports so go to
dashboard click on
actions add a action called new
filter select Source sheet in the source
sheet dashboard 2 only select region and
state analysis report
and in the Target sheet just deselect
region and state
analysis on the source sheet keep the
Run action on select
and
click
okay now whatever state you select over
here that particular state will be used
as a filter across both these reports so
it means in North Dakota you have all
these Cate subcategories being sold and
their Associated profit and on the map
profit by Straight report you can see
the North Dakota State being highlighted
or only selected and the relevant profit
and
sales okay so here is the total profit
and sales in the profit by state report
and in this sales and profit by
subcategory report you have the breakup
of the profit and sales across the
categories similarly you can select any
other state and automatically
the filters will get applied
automatically see this Marine
main
okay so with this we cover our example
of how to create multiple reports and
then
connect them or encapsulate them in a
single dashboard for a single view
across all these
reports we are going to take example of
the Netflix database which we have and
we will prepare certain reports in order
to identify what kind of reports we can
generate from such a data set So
currently on my screen what you can see
is the Tableau the Netflix data sheets
the data sources where you have the
Netflix shows movies their Associated
duration uh what kind of shows or movies
are there they release here uh the
associated rating description and a key
which is the show ID now this is the
unique identifier for each
show uh in this Netflix title sheet and
with this show ID all other sheets are
related like you know who are the
directors of the show in which country
the show was released what is the cost
of each show all that information is in
this sheet and to which particular
category basically the listed in
category is being uh listed in this
particular sheets so what we're going to
do is first we going to import this
sheet into tabue
okay and then create relationship
between them using the tblo relationship
canvas so first our the primary
transaction table the sheet in which all
the information related to movies is
there or shows is there is in Netflix
titles and then we will
drag sheet like Netflix cast titles cast
now w has automatically identified the
relationship between uh the show ID of
titles and show id id of titles cast and
it has made a join so if you double
click
this you can see this relationship
cardinality and the related fields
similarly I'll drag relation titles
category countries and
directors Now by virtue of this all all
the sheets have now been joined with
Netflix titles and with this
relationship ready we can start
preparing our
reports now let's create a basic report
where we can just glance the data like
you know whatever we were seeing in the
Excel how it looks in tblo so you have
all the types of movies
then for for example I drag the release
here now first I do not want to uh
consider it as
a dimension so I'll
just release ear know per category per
type there is a release here and then
I'll drop the listed
in so now these are the categories so
per year the the details of the
categories right and then you
can drag the title and the associated
rating so this is just a view of your
data we can name it as shows listing
report now let's try to create some
report for some uh measures some numbers
Etc so now let's check in which country
how many movies or titles were released
you know what is the count so first
let's drag
the
country so as soon as we drag the
country uh field it is identified that
it has the geographical names and
identified the latitude and longitude
details so Tabo internally does that
automatically and it has identified the
spots across the globe globe of the
relevant country now let's drag the
listed in on the color
section now what it is doing is it is
showing in which country what different
kind of uh category wise movies are or
shows are been released like in Sri
Lanka documentaries have been released
in India action and adventure United
States action and adventure like this
now let's
put account
of the titles right so if you see
247 action adventure movies or shows
have been released in United States okay
so this is one inference by this
particular report you
can identify so let's save this report
as
listed
in by
country okay now let's create another
report we will call it as the per year
statistical report in this first I'll
put the release ears in the column
now count of Netflix titles so this is
the count of Netflix titles per year
2017 2016 14 and then count of Netflix
titles in the
countries this is the second bar chart
okay now what I'll do is I'll combine it
into
one for
so one
report we
are moving in the bar creating the bar
and one in the line and now I just have
to so we will click on the count of
Netflix titles by country right click
Market dual access so now as soon as you
click this both the uh charts have been
combined and right click over here and
say synchronize access
okay okay so now if you can see see
right in
2017 you had uh
2,33 Netflix
releases across all categories and 11
159 titles right 1063 titles
in
2017 so this is a descending
representation of the count of titles
release per year across category and
across
titles so let's call this as per
year stats
now let's create another
report number of
shows per title
okay so or or sorry per rating so we
will drag the rating column and
we
will count of
titles and
unique count of titles and unique count
of show
IDs okay
one is bar and one is
line
okay so this is a report which shows
rating wise titles and the show IDs
so in the tool tip you can see the
distinct count of titles and show ID per
rating okay so let's call
it shows per rating
now let's create another sheet call it
as
shows by
cast so in
this what we going to do is first drag
the cast column on the rows section you
have name all of all the cast and then
we drag
the show ID on the column section and
put a count D and sort it okay uh you
can remove the null cast and this is
your sorted order and on the label
section you can say show Mark labels and
you will see the count that anupam K has
done the maximum then Shah ruk Khan om
Puri nudin sha so this is the details on
the sorted order that who has done how
many shows okay
then next is shows by director similar
to shows by
cast
drag director into
rows or differently if you want to
prepare into columns and then count
of show ID
okay sort
it and you can actually filter out the
null director
value and this is your account put the
label so you can see Jan's switter has
the maximum
shows
okay then create another report shows by
category
now similarly drag the listed in in the
rows and show ID
count remove the null
category and
sort labels show Mark labels so
International movies are the highest
category drama the next comedy
International TV TV shows this way you
have your
category now let's create a dashboard in
which we want to bring combine all these
reports
and take a common view so first let's
drag listed in by
country then shows by
director also please let's set the size
as
automatic then let's drag shows by categ
and shows by cast now these four reports
are on a single dashboard we will link
them to each other so go to worksheet
actions add action
filter select dashboard
one only select shows by category here
and in Target dashboard
one except shows by category keep
everything else and in the source sheet
just select click select click
okay okay now whatever category you will
select over here that related category
data will automatically be shown in
other reports like see International
movies across the globe across countries
directors of only International movies
who has done the maximum Johnny toe and
uh shows by cast right that who has done
the maximum International movies or
dramas or
comedies see paresh Ravel has the
maximum number of comedies and then if
you see the comedy movies uh you know
these are the count of comedy movies
released across the countries and the
who is the director
another very interesting report which
you can prepare is that for example you
want to check in which country maximum
duration of uh
your uh maximum duration
of movies have been released so
first let's create uh conf to
measure moove this
okay so if you see maximum duration of
the movies or the entire Netflix content
is maximum United States in India these
many minutes next is United Kingdom and
you can also change the
colors whatever you feel is as per your
standards or as per the convention you
can change the color
combination so there are multiple ways
you can generate reports and uh hope you
have understood how you can leverage
such a data to create your reports and
now if you're an aspiring business
analyst then try giving a sh to Simply
lears postgraduate program and business
analytics from P University in
collaboration with IBM the course Link
in the description and pin comment
should take you to the program being
offered today we are going to talk about
powerbi what are its features what are
the basic advantages of using a
visualization tool like powerbi and we
will talk about how to install power bi
and other features it provides and the
basic
setup so let's discuss what's in it for
us
today now we will first talk about why
powerbi you know why it's a popular tool
and what problem it solves what is
powerbi uh and what are the primary
features of powerbi uh which you can use
in your day-to-day data analytics
visualizations creating fancy reports
creating meaningful intelligent reports
uh for your organization for your
personal use uh for crunching numbers
for generating reports real time
Etc now the most popular tool for
powerbi is the powerbi desktop uh I'll
show you certain uh aspects of powerbi
desktop and then I'll show you the steps
how to install powerbi desktop on your
machine and then definitely power bi
desktop is a free tool provided by
Microsoft but then you can also
subscribe uh for an Enterprise version
which is primarily used uh by
Enterprises for publishing their data uh
so we'll see the difference and then
overview of o or dashboards which can be
created uh you know what kind of
dashboards can be created in
poweri so this is the agenda for us
today now why powerbi so generally
uh you know visualization tools
reporting tools are required in order to
create and prepare and analyze
meaningful data it could be a data for
an organization it could be a social
media platform data it could be a data
from iot devices but something which
needs to be analyzed and some
intelligent inferences and data mining
has to be done on top of it now imagine
there is today we in a world where
terabytes of data and information is
getting generated on a instantaneous
places on minute by- minute basis so it
becomes very essential to churn out
something meaningful something
intelligent out of it in the market
there are lot of other tools where which
are available like kilick uh altrix tblo
and powerbi so powerbi is a Microsoft
product which is one of the most popular
products and it comes as a free to
download product Microsoft powerbi
desktop which is available and I'll show
you a couple of ways how you can install
it on your machine but why powerbi is um
uh popular is because it provides a lot
of outof thebox features drag and do
features which we will talk about in our
subsequent sessions and uh you know
classes but today's session is primarily
focused on giving you guys an
introduction on what is the purpose of
powerbi and what all problems it solve
uh in the in the real world so powerbi
allows you to VI view analyze and
visualize huge quantities of data and
the data could be any format Excel CSV
text or it could be a direct connection
to a database like SQL MySQL Azure
Oracle anyone IBM db2 so it supports n
number of uh you know data types or sets
and it's very powerful in terms of data
connectivity so it uses powerful
compression algorithms to import and
cache the data within the PB file so
it's as convenient as a simple software
if suppose you import a data and then
you prepare a report and then you can
easily share the reports uh with your
peers or someone who's co-developing
with you either through powerbi cloud
services or even you can share the PB
file in an email or through any other
means and you can share the data set
with the concern and they can then work
on the report independently so there are
different ways there is no uh kind of a
limitation for you know uh working on
powerbi there are multiple ways and it
is very fast it is the most fast uh tool
to work with Excel because definitely
Excel is also a Microsoft techn
technology so it works very fast on
Excel based data and gives you numbers
and Reporting at a very high
speed so now once you have imported the
data powerbi allows you to model the
data allows you to work intelligently on
the data it allows you to model the data
in a way that if you're importing data
from multiple Excel sheets importing
data from multiple tables you can easily
create a relationship between those
tables or data sets in powerbi and then
create visually appealing reports
meaningful reports as have been
emphasizing and make sense out of that
data no data in silos is of any use data
in Silo means a single worksheet or a
single data set will not churn out any
meaningful information until unless you
basically join it Club it merge it Union
it
append it with some other data sets
because a single data set will never be
able to hold that much amount of
information which is generally required
for a you know important
report so it has easy drag and drop
functionality with features that allow
you to copy all formatting across
similar visualizations so just like in
Microsoft Excel we use format printer to
copy the format of one cell to another
it similar features very
very similar to excel products or
Microsoft product they have provided
that if you have applied uh a particular
theme on a report you can easily
replicate that on any other report the
font uh the header size the background
color you don't need to do it again and
again so there's lot of reusable
features which are also available okay
now as I said Excel is a Microsoft
product powerbi is a mic oft product so
they have intercompatibility you can
publish data from Excel to powerbi now
with the latest developments and
enhancements as of today Excel has also
uh plugged in a new feature called Power
pivot which I'll uh show you uh later
down the line but that also allows you
to do a quick analysis not you can't
create of course complex reports or uh
fancy reports like powerbi but Power
pivot allows you to create you know
quick measures quick functions quick
calculations on your data quickly only
in Excel so it's an Excel plug-in but
whereas you know you can powerbi is also
compatible with Excel so when you create
a report in powerbi it gives you inbuilt
feature to export your powerbi report
into Excel format directly you don't
need to do any programming for it
also uh you can easily publish when you
publish your powerbi reports it allows
you to give some inbuilt intelligence of
analyzing your reports in Excel and it
gives you all those of all those
features of exporting your powerbi
reports into Excel which is not
available in any other tool or otherwise
those tools have to create plugins
create addins and probably they might
charge for it uh but powerbi comes with
lot of out of the Box features which are
very very helpful for analyzing data in
Excel and vice
versa aure Cloud now Azure itself again
is a Microsoft cloud uh uh text tack so
using powerbi with Azure allows you to
analyze and share large volumes of data
so Azure basically Azure database or
Azure Cloud servers are meant to hold
huge amount of data and powerbi allows
you to have seamless connection you can
easily connect to Azure data Lake uh you
can reduce the time it takes to get
insights and increase collaboration
between business analyst data engineers
and data scientists so aure data L
becomes the central focal point where
all your uh analysts Engineers uh can
keep working on on the centralized piece
of data and churn out their reports data
scientists primarily job is to keep the
data in a structured way optimized way
way optimize the input output operations
disk operations and memory utilization
so that the reports also get churned out
in a faster manner so every uh you know
every person has their own role in order
to give a quick refreshable report a
quick rendered report any report which
is taking huge amount of time to get
rendered will not eventually be used by
the business users because then it does
not solve the purpose the report should
be fast report should have uh you know
appropriate filters slices and dices you
should be able to you know uh create the
reports or dynamically or you should be
able to analyze visualize the data
dynamically so all those visualization
features are available in powerbi and it
works seamlessly either it is small data
or huge data uh it allows that you to
work on those kind of data you know
seamless
fashion right so this is just a very uh
quick uh example of uh how a typical
dashboard looks like dashboard is
nothing but you know you have clubbed
couple of multiple reports on a single
page and you know if you change a filter
uh a single filter on the page all the
reports will honor that filter and the
numbers will change accordingly so if
you see the in this example there's a
filter or a drop down of product ID
product name employee name or or
supervisor or a date range so whatever
date range or filter you will apply all
the reports on this dashboard will get
changed based on the filter you have
selected so powerbi allows you to get
insights from data and turn insights
into action to take data driven business
decision and that is the ultimate goal
of any visualization tool that is the
purpose for which visualization tools
are bought uh uh and purchased by the
organizations and data is fed into
them now powerbi fetches data from
Factory sensors social media sources to
get access to realtime analytics so that
you are always ready to make timely
business decisions to so basically there
is a uh feature of live connection or
cut off data connection so either you
can work on data which is deciding on a
machine and you can just work on the cut
off data
like for example it's there's a data
which is available for sales 2017 2018
and you're just working on a historical
data it's a cut off data or it could be
possible that you want to be connected
live uh to a uh realtime iot based
sensor based data or social media data
like Twitter Facebook feeds or you know
you connected to live Google worksheets
that is also possible you just need to
publish your Google sheet for a public
domain embed the UR into powerbi and
then whoever updates that Google sheet
automatically the powerbi report will
also start honoring and consuming the
new data which is added in the uh Google
sheet so all those kind of real time
streaming analytics is also possible and
that is one big feature uh and very
important feature of powerbi which is
widely used and has a very huge uh you
know Market acceptance and Market
utilization now what is
powerbi powerbi is a business analytic
service provided by Microsoft that lets
you visualize your data and share
insights right so earlier you know p u
uh Microsoft used to have a technology
called ssas now they have replaced
actually ssas and SSRS with powerbi so
basically you can use power PBI On the
data which is there in your Excel or any
other data source and the powerbi
service or powerbi desktop uh basically
creates a connection to those data sets
and uh import it cach it and give you a
handle to it in order to work with it so
you can create these fancy meaningful
visualizations like for example there's
a geographical map if you are importing
data for a country or a continent or a
region powerbi will automatically detect
that it's a geographical information and
give you a map with latitude longitude
information and you just need to plot uh
your um your numbers on the map either
you can use bubbles or or either you can
use triangles or whatever data uh
structure you want to use but all the
mapping will be available geographically
then you can create pie charts which is
shown in this visualization you can
create tree maps you can create cards
where you know you can highlight the the
most important numbers like sales total
sales of your company uh across all the
regions or the growth chart or the
month-on-month uh you know sales of your
organization or number of total number
of products or units sold so whatever is
important and to be highlighted for the
management to take any meaningful
decision or any insights you want to
share powerbi
visualization tool the powerbi
visualization uh uh uh chart allows you
to drag and drop and create wonderful
reports
okay so what are the features of powerbi
so powerbi desktop is something a
standalone tool which you need to
install on your machine it allows you to
build reports by accessing data easily
you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report though yes it is beneficial that
if you know
uh some SQL programming analytical
programming or you are aware of advanced
features of any analytical tool that
might help you but that's not a
showstopper uh you can easily build
reports in quick turnaround time without
needing any technical background you
just need to have some
analytical uh mindset and you can create
uh Savvy visualization and you know
analytical reports
stream analytics as I mentioned you can
create a live connection uh with any
kind of uh data it could be iot it could
be media social media it could be Google
Docs it could be uh you know any other
kind of uh you know live connection it
could be a live database connection
itself so any insertions or updations or
deletions happening will automatically
reflect in your report
yes multiple data sources and that has
to be the uh primary criteria for any
tool to be popular if any visualization
tool is limited to certain data sets
then you know it will not be highly
acceptable in the
market and custom visualizations right
so as I showed you certain uh examples
in the past uh in the previous
presentation uh that feature is very
important because someone might want to
look the kpis look at the kpis from
different perspective some management
might want to look at the kpis from a
different perspective so you need to you
need to have uh that capability to
create different visualization from the
same data set now let's take a look that
how to install powerbi desktop on your
machine so basically what you need to do
is you need to go to this
URL powerbi do
microsoft.com enus desktop okay and you
need to just enter
this now you can download it for free so
just click over here
and it will open Microsoft store so
basically now what Microsoft have done
in the latest operating systems is that
when you are trying to download you can
actually directly go to the Microsoft
Store and search for
powerbi so let's wait for a couple of
seconds right here so powerbi desktop in
Microsoft store for me it's already
installed so it's asking me to open it
I'll open it in a while but for for
anyone who has not installed he will see
the button of install over here and it
will automatically install in your uh
machine and then you can easily go and
open power VI desktop now if I click
open over
here now this is the
uh UI of the powerbi desktop I'm not
going to go right now in creating
reports right away we will talk about
that in a subsequent session with sample
data sets and we will cover the features
of powerb desktop one by one but this is
what it is this is the whole tool of
powerbi which is having the
visualization pain all the different
visualizations are you know can be
created from this pane then this is the
P pain which allows you to select the
data data fields then there is a report
view data View and relationship view the
data model view where multiple
relationships you can create you can
view the data uh in the grid of the
tables which you will create and the
reports so you can create multiple
reports uh on multiple Pages you can
keep adding pages either you can D
create multiple reports on a single page
and it will become a dashboard rep or
you can create separate independent
reports on the single
page and these are the menu options
which we will talk about how you can
change color scheming you can do data
modeling you can create new reports and
you can also transform data it is the
biggest feature extract transform and
load the data apply different logic
changing data types massaging the
information creating new joins uh
appending the data you know adding new
columns etc etc uh we that is what you
can do in transform data so this itself
is a whole different world it's a diff
uh dedicated topic so we will talk about
that in our subsequent sessions so
what's in it for us today we will be
learning how to connect to data
different data types data files like
Excel PDF then what are the different
data importing modes and then I will
also show you
practically different sets how to import
them in power VI and use it for your
visualization purpose now what are the
steps to connect to data so now we will
go directly into powerbi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will uh do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data directly from a web page and import
the data now it is asking for a URL in
order to import data so what I have done
is I have created a Google Excel sheet
with simple data with rows and columns
and what I've done is I've have uh
shared this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your tblo paste it
link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading okay now it has read one of the
HTML tables so I'll select this one now
you can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another row
let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my table and I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my power
query editor I clicked refresh all and I
got my new row which is there in the
live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply
now you can see the new row the row
number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I have already
prepared a text file called sub
categories.
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back
to my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV option and I'm going to select
option mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers Etc right and I
can now directly load this file
okay so now once the data is imported in
powerbi it is like irrelevant to me it's
a composite data in import I'm doing
right so in my presentation when I'm
talking about importing data there are
different importing modes right import
data import can happen through different
ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using MySQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now our next task is to import from CSV
let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
product uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a ex Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories though
with different uh uh data storage types
but still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I have done is I have created a PDF
called customers my customers data is
lying in a PDF so what I've done is I've
created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set which I have created in PDF
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load okay
you can rename this as
PDF
table so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I've have done is I've
already installed my SQL server on my
local instance and there's already a
schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables already
prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to
First download a connector my SQL
powerbi connector so you need to go to
this
link and then click on download and
install the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it after you have
done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the name
click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading
them okay so now this is the exact data
which is there in the employee and
Department in my SQL okay so this is one
example of how to create connectivity
between powerbi and my SQL now I want to
do the same thing using SQL Server
Microsoft SQL Server so I have also
installed Microsoft SQL server on my
machine and I have used the SQL Express
so this is the name of my server so
which I'll copy the the server name and
go to get data select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I I
have I have these three tables customers
employee attrition Olympic events so I
can use probably the customers one which
is
now you can see this is the data the
customer data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql and this is
from my
SQL
and okay so now this is not the only uh
data
sets you can import now if you take a
look at the options which powerbi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
uh within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF Pary or even SharePoint folder
which is itself a
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgress
uh sbase Terra dat and then sap uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and and number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data ver Etc aour
there are different kind of storage uh
mechanisms in azour and azour itself is
a Microsoft Technology
so it has a compatibility with lot of
azour uh based data storages like azour
SQ database blob storage uh Azure data
braks right aure HD Insight spark so if
you have those kind of services running
on your Azor cloud services you can even
import them over
here now online services like you know
you have erps running uh or some data
which is shared on the internet if you
want to import it uh that is also
possible through certain products uh
Dynamics 365 Microsoft Exchange online
Salesforce Google analytics Adobe
analytics GitHub uh LinkedIn sales if
you want to do some analysis of some
social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can import
then other miscellaneous are also there
web based Hive R script python script if
there something to import get data from
uh Google Sheets like we saw one example
in our video right now so there are
multiple options
available now once you have imported the
data which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you're
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried to once it is imported into
uh powerbi then there is no limitation
of how you use it you can create
visualizations across different data
sets and then create
your standard reports
so this is the example of importing data
from web importing data from a database
from a PDF and then once you have data
you can shape and combine data you can
basically do what whatever
transformation you want to do you want
to uh make joins merge the data so for
example if we go back to our powerbi and
if I go back to my transform data
section
now as I have now different data sets
available with me I have I can do any
kind of you know operation
transformation on the data right uh so
like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the
column right all those trans
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right look for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as new
and I can select product categories and
product
subcategories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will
have now I have the table which has the
category and the sub category and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization hey
everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel today we will learn how
to use Microsoft power query that said
if these are the type of videos you'd
like to watch then hit that like And
subscribe buttons and the bell icon to
get notified now without further delay
let's get started with the topic which
is how to use Microsoft power query so
imagine you have a lot of data it can be
an Excel file it can be a PDF SQL
database cloud or anything if it is Data
it's your data right so you have a lot
of data now you have the source of the
data after that I'm absolutely sure that
the data is not clean enough to perform
some analysis so you go through another
step where you have to clean your data
from unwanted rows and columns which
doesn't make sense or might have some
invalid data right so you need to make
sure that your data is completely
accurate and has some standards for your
analysis right so that's the next step
which is clean and transform after the
clean and transform step you have the
next step which is load that particular
data to your platform it could be Excel
it could be some data visualization tool
like TBL Loop VI Etc right after that
you generate some meaningful information
of that you create some pivot tables
pivot charts and uh line graphs Etc
right so which makes some sense of that
data you will understand what what
exactly is happening with your business
how many leads or how many traffic
orders what's right and which is the
best performing product which is the
worst performing product and you need to
take some decisions on your business
which can make some impact on your
overall profit or Revenue right so
imagine if you want to do this for an
year if you get one year's data and you
do it in a day or two it's fine and if
it's on a monthly basis you get
month-on-month data and you want to do
it okay it could not be worse you can
spend one or two days and it's fine but
if what if it's week on week you start
to think right what if it's a daily task
it's a mundane task right you have to do
all these Steps step by step
repetitively and it it doesn't make any
you interested anymore in that
particular type of job and uh the major
point of this is you end up spending
more time on cleaning the data
transforming loading it and the worst
part you don't get proper time specific
time which you want to actually dedicate
to plan out something and bring up
strategies to improve your business
right so what if you could automate this
right what if there is someone who could
perform all these steps for you in the
way you want and you can actually have
some time to produce some pivot tables
pivot charts and then understand what
exactly is happening with your business
and find out some critical points where
you can improvise and bring up some good
Revenue what if there was someone who
can perform all these steps for you
clean your data transform it the way you
want load it to your platform and help
you create your P charts and P tables
and actually save you a lot of time
where you can spend all that time
understanding your critical points where
you need attention you can fix them and
plan some strategies out to bring out
some good Revenue right that exact
someone who can do all these steps for
you and automate your data cleaning data
transformation and loading tasks for you
is exactly the Microsoft power query so
you can use Microsoft power query either
in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft power PI
right now let's uh kind of generate some
data so uh this data will be generated
using chat GPD and we will not generate
data like which is not small like for a
week on WE analysis or a day ID analysis
we will create data for years so we will
take five consecutive years starting
from 2020 to 2024 and we will have some
uh data generated using chat GPD and we
will automate that data and try to get
some analysis done right let's jump on
to chat GPD so before we go to chat GPD
I have a prompt written here so this
particular prompt will guide or explain
chat jpd what exactly you want right so
giving some uh like the Excel data right
over here we have audit date order ID
Shi mode and customer name customer ID
everything right so we have the sales
quantity discount profit Etc so in the
same format or a similar format if not
the same format we are explaining chat
GB that we need these columns the order
ID order date delivery date Etc and we
want all these files in a downloadable
Excel file links right so you can also
specify this column should have certain
certain things and this column can have
certain certain things right so we will
copy this prompt and head back to chat
GPD and you can just paste the prompt
and hit enter there you go now your
request has been analyzed and shortly
you should be receiving some
downloadable Excel files or some
recommendations from chat GPD I've
already put from this process and we
have already downloaded some data so
there you you go you have the data from
2020 to 2024 you can just click on this
to download the file so I've already uh
done this job and U I've downloaded the
files so those files are exactly in my
downloads here so if you go to downloads
here we have ERS data for 2021 2022 2023
and 2024 so this orders data has just
one file which is orders 2020 so we will
perform the data cleaning so first we
will specify the source of the data then
we will perform the data cleaning and
transformation process then we load this
particular Excel 2020 data into Excel
and then we load this Excel data into
the visualization tool we'll use Excel
for this and then generate some pivot
tables and pivot charts we will only do
this for one file which is 2020 right
now what's the surprising part is this
particular file will also get data
continuously for the next year 2021 for
the next year 2022 for the next year
2023 and the current year 2024 right
when we just copy paste or cut copy
paste these files into this particular
folder the same transformation steps the
same data cleaning steps and the same
data loading steps and also including
the analysis will be done for you in the
Excel pivot table right the process has
been just automated right so you can see
that happening for that let's open a new
Excel file so I have the Excel folder
right over here so a new blank Excel
workbook will be opened and if you go to
data here you have get data as we said
it can be a file it can be an Excel file
XML Json PDF it can be from cloud it can
be from a SQL database any any other
source if it's data can work from it so
we will give a file here right so just
uh uh okay so so we will give a file
here so select file and go to the last
option which reads as from folder right
so go to downloads and select that AIT
data yeah go to downloads and select
that a this data remember this
particular folder should have only one
file according to us which is Is 2020
data the first years data right select
the folder and open and this should
include the data of only one file which
is a 2020 right so if you have multiple
files you can add the combine transform
and load if you have just one file you
can just go with the transformation
option over here or you can load if you
are comfortable with what you have so I
feel there are some minor changes which
I would like to make to my data so I
would go with the transform option now
the power query window will shortly open
now with the power query window opened
you can select the orders 2022 Excel
folder and it will be loaded now let's
try to click on the content button over
here which should load our data now you
can go with the first file so here's the
preview as we expected we have the order
ID order date delivery date Etc just
press on okay so the data has been suc
successfully loaded right now we have
the First Column as Source name which we
will not be needing anymore and you can
just remove that order ID is fine order
date is fine is it no right so you can
just select both the columns and change
the data type right so here you have the
option of change the data type where you
will change a data type from whole
number to date so that you get a date
right so you have that the First
Transformation step changing data type
has been recorded here so this is like
uh we uh XL vbx or macro which will save
all the steps and will apply uh to all
the uh upcoming files right you have to
change the type of delivery date as well
so we will be finding uh the how many
days it took to deliver or if if the
delivery got delayed right so we can
test that and here if you see
uh yes we requested customer ID and
customer name so we got customer ID
along with the name so we don't want
that we want that in two separate
columns we can do that so you can just
select the entire column go to the split
column option over here select by D
limiter so I think it all automatically
recognize that for us but there is one
loophole we have a space d limiter space
option so just press okay and they
should be helping us with the customer
ID so that's let rename the customer ID
to just customer ID and this to uh
customer name
space right and that's done here we have
product which is fine quantity is fine
traffic is fine leads is fine orders and
here comes the money part so we have
Revenue cost to company so we don't know
the profit yet right so to calculate the
profit what you need to do is subtract
revenue from cost of the company and
automatically you will get your profit
so in some instances you might get a
negative value don't worry about that
because uh that can be a discount offer
or some 50% off 75% off that you
regularly sell out your products which
are selling in less num so that you can
just you know uh move out the products
from the store
so that can be done and order status so
we have order status as delivered in
transit not delivered yet or order
cancelled right so we might have to rule
out some uh status here right so we are
calculating profit here so we don't want
the profit for cancelled orders or uh
not delivered okay maybe okay okay not
delivered orders uh this might be
considered as the cost of company and
revenue because uh it takes some delay
to refund the amount to the customers so
we can just add a filter to this
particular column and uh we will
unselect not delivered products and
Order cancel products so not delivered
happens when the vendor is not available
to deliver the product to the delivery
agencies so in that case uh the order
gets automatically cancelled and uh the
order will be the money will be refunded
to the customer so we will rule out
these now the data is clean now uh as we
thought to calculate the profit select
these two columns first Revenue then
cost to company because we are
subtracting cost a company from revenue
right so we will go to add to column and
standard and here we have some Ops so we
will substract that so we will get the
profit here so now now you can name it
as profit done so we just move that
column to the money part of this
particular data set so profit cost to
company and revenue are the money parts
so we will change data Ty from just
values to currency right so then that
should be converted into the dollars
format now the first one we don't need
this Source name so you can just rule
out this you can just uh remove this
column and there you go now you have a
clean data you have the order ID order
date delivery date yeah we forgot uh the
another part of this particular data set
transformation where we wanted to find
out the number of days it took to
deliver the product okay I think we
changed other ID so we don't want this
so the first okay let's changes to the
to the whole number as it was okay so
all ready fine now we wanted to find out
the number of days it took to deliver
the product so we will select the
delivery date first and then the order
date second go to add column and uh we
will select subtract in days and we
should have that now let's change the uh
substract subtraction name to days to
deliver and you can move this column
right select the whole column and hold
it drag it and you can move this column
along with the dates part of this data
set where we have the ordered date and
delivered the date right right over here
and you will find how many days it took
to deliver a certain product now um
let's recheck once order ID date
delivery date dat to deliver customer ID
customer name what product did he or she
ordered and what quantity and uh the
traffic which we received to the we
website the traffic which we received to
the website the number of leads we got
out of those traffic numbers the number
of orders we got out of those uh uh
lease and what's the revenue we got out
of those orders and what was the cost of
the company and what is the profit that
we made out of that order right and we
also have the order status remember we
only considered remember we only
considered two types right uh we
considered in transit and delivered
statuses only we ruled out cancelled
orders and not delivered orders so that
we have accurate results of our profit
made and revenue made out of this right
now I'm completely satisfied with my
transformation and cleaning of my dat
set now let's go to home and here we
have the option of close and load so we
will go with that and this particular D
set should be loaded to the data
visualization where we have selected
Excel right uh so we have the ERS data
for
20 20 correct okay let's not add date
here because after all we will have some
more data for 2021 2 three and four
right so let it be the way it is and if
you just check the filter here we have
only one year and if you just check the
filter here you will have only one year
and if you just just check the filter
here you will have only one year
2020 and if you go to the delivery date
which let's say if you have an order
placed on December 31st and it got
delivered on January 5th or something so
you'll have a little bit of a part of
when 21 data which is completely all
right not to be worried about so the
main important thing is order date so we
want the audit dates of 2020 so that is
loaded here right now you can just
select the whole data set over here and
uh you can add or insert some pivot
tables here right from the selected
range and uh let's go with the default
option which creates a new sheet and
everything in a new location right here
you have it now let's say you wanted to
make out some U insights from this uh
data set let's delete the other sheet
which we don't want and let's name it as
pivot now the products will be loaded to
the columns and uh profit will be loaded
to values so you have a data set over
here sum of profit from beds chairs
cupboards sofa tort so here you have the
pivot table which has sum of profit bed
chair cupboard sofa T and grand total
sum of profits made from these these
these and these now select this entire
data and go to the the uh insert option
here go to the pivot chart and uh here
automatically here you can see that it
is you know suggesting or recommending
us to go for the bar chart which is a
lot more better just select okay and you
have your paper chart here right and see
the grand total here 22
4811
4.15 now this is only for one years of
data now what we will do is go back to
the downloads folder select the
remaining years which is 2021 2 3 and 4
add that to the file location so let's
quickly go to our folder here and go to
downloads select the folders I'm going
to cut them from here go to a data and
paste them here right now our job is
done if we go back to the data here go
to home and data
okay so now that we have added the data
to our folder go to the a data and here
select the data segment and just select
refresh all so everything is refreshed
now let's check the auto date filter and
we will have all the five years from
2020 to 1 2 3 and four and let's press
okay for that and if you go to the pivot
table you can also see the changes here
just press refresh all and there you go
you have the update dated data right
over here now that saved a lot of time
for you and now that time can be
utilized to plan a strategy and focus on
the lower parts of your business and
improvise them and bring a big change to
the revenue and with that we have come
to an end of this session on how to use
Microsoft power query we'll compare the
two most popular job roles in the field
of Information Technology that is
business analyst versus data analyst
business analyst is a professional who
Bridges the gap between the it and the
business teams in an organization they
use data analytics and modern
Technologies to assess processes and
deliver data driven solutions they
understand and solve a business problem
and validate business requirements a
business analyst generates reports for
executives and
stakeholders they part of the business
operation and work closely with the
technology team to improve the quality
of the services being delivered they
also assist in the integration and
testing of new Solutions now let's talk
about the job description of a data
analyst with the rapid increase in data
generation today the term data analyst
has found its prominence a data analyst
collects processes and performs analysis
of large data sets every business
generates data in several formats this
data can be in the form of customer
information and feedback log files
transaction data marketing research and
so on on it is the duty of a data
analyst to transform these business data
into valuable insights some of the
problems that can be addressed are how
to improve a business how to provide
good customer experience what would be
the ideal price for a new product how to
reduce Transportation costs and so on
data analysts deal with data handling
data modeling and Reporting with this
brief understanding of the job
description for a business analyst and a
data analyst let's now shift our Focus
towards the various responsibilities of
a business analyst a business analyst
identifies the business goals
understands the problems faced by an
organization and comes up with a
cost-effective solution to tackle the
issues they thoroughly understand the
requirements from the clients and assign
the right resources Bas communicate and
work closely with the development team
to design the solution for a problem
they ensure that the development team
doesn't spend their time understanding
the stakeholders requirements and often
give iterative feedback on the solution
being developed they check and validate
if the project is running fine with the
help of user acceptance testing they
also verify if the solution being worked
on is in line with the requirements and
ensure that the final product satisfies
the user expectations Bas assess the
functional and non-functional
requirements a business analyst
documents the project findings and
results they present the project
conclusions to the stakeholders and
clients along with delivering
maintenance reports and building
visualizations to make decisions
now let's take a look at the
responsibilities of a data analyst first
and foremost a data analyst must
identify and understand the
organization's goal and
requirements this helps to plan and
streamline the analysis process data
analysts collect data from various
heterogeneous sources they assess the
available resources comprehend the
business problem and gather the right
data for analysis they work closely with
different team members like programmers
business analysts and data scientists
data filtering and data wrangling are
vital jobs of a data analyst the data
collected is often noisy and it contains
missing values hence it is crucial to
clean the collected data and remove
invalid values to make it ready for
analysis they use a variety of
analytical statistical and business
intelligence tools to spot Trends and
patterns in complex data sets discover
hidden insights and prepare summary
reports for the leadership team they
also use programming languages for data
DES in and data
manipulation now it's time for us to
understand the difference between a
business analyst and a data analyst
based on the skill set they
possess first let's look at the skills
that can help you become a ba a business
analyst should have a graduation degree
in any relevant field such as business
accounting Information Systems human
resources or engineering you can apply
for entry-level business analyst
positions or with professional
experience Excel is a powerful analytics
and Reporting tool for working with data
Bas use Excel to perform various
calculations data analysis plan and
editorial calendar and calculate
customer discounts to derive meaningful
insights and take decisions Bas use SQL
to retrieve manipulate and analyze data
stored in relational databases critical
thinking skills are important to
understand customers business needs it
allows them to distinguish between
requirements that add value to the
business and those that should be given
a lower priority Bas should find
different ways to address each challenge
data visualization is a key skill for
Bas to build interactive dashboards and
reports to convey the outcomes of a
project knowledge of Tablo PBI and click
view is required to make different types
of reports depending on the business
requirements business analysts should
have a good Hands-On programming
experience to solve complex tasks and
perform faster analysis of data hence
knowledge of programming languages such
as R and python is a pre-re is it
finally they should have good
presentation skills they should also be
confident about their findings and
conclusions and communicate it in front
of the stakeholders and clients let's
Now understand the skills that a data
analyst should possess you must have a
bachelor's degree in any relevant field
or be a graduate in statistics economics
or science you're eligible to become a
data analyst being a fresher or as an
experienced professional you should have
domain knowledge in the field you are
working in once again knowledge of excel
is another basic requirement for a data
analyst data analysts often work with
structured data so they should be
proficient in writing SQL queries using
data manipulation and data definition
commands they should know how to create
stored procedures another crucial skill
for a data analyst is to have hands-on
experience with programming languages
such as python R SAS and JavaScript you
can analyze and visualize large data
sets and create predictive models for
making business decisions data analysts
create data visualizations using
libraries such as map plot lib cbon
ggplot and plotly this helps them to
perform exploratory data analysis
knowledge of tblo and powerbi is
required to create different business
reports with the help of graphs and
charts data analysts should have
knowledge of machine learning algorithms
to build sophisticated models and make
future predictions so they should know
about linear regression logistic
regression support Vector machines k
mean clustering and other supervised and
unsupervised learning algorithms finally
data analyst should also possess good
communication and presentation skills
now let's discuss a salary structure for
both of these job roles according to pay
scale a business analyst in the United
States earns an average salary of
$69,000 while in India you can earn
nearly 6 lakh rupees per anim now
talking about the salary of a data
analyst according to pay scale in the US
a data analyst earns an average salary
of 60,000
7110 perim and in India you can earn
around
424,000 rupees perim let's now move on
and look at the different companies
hiring for business analyst roles here
we have Oracle the search engine giant
Google the American MNC cognizant and
e-commerce company Amazon in addition to
that we have Ernest and Young technology
giant IBM Dell and Cisco hiring business
analysts talking about the company's
hiring for date analysts we have Twitter
Google the social media leader Facebook
and Amazon we also have the American Oil
Company shell the electric vehicle
company Tesla apple and the American
Credit Reporting Agency
Equifax now choosing the right field
that is to become a business analyst or
a data analyst could be a challenging
task the key points that you have to
keep in mind before making a decision is
first review your background and see
what qualifications you have check what
skills you possess and the domain
knowledge you have then gauge your
interest to see what suits you best and
finally consider your long-term goals

for these programs if you want to grow
your career as a business analyst or a
data analist business analyst interview
questions my name is Richard kersner
with the simply team we'll go over some
beginner intermediate and advanced level
questions to expect in interviews when
you're looking at business
analytics let's start with the
differentiation between a risk and an
issue and this should be a very
fundamental question uh dealing with
business because in business they want
to make money and we really want to
understand where the split is on a lot
of these things so always ask yourself
where is the bottom dollar on this and
what does this mean uh risk is your
potential poal in an issue is something
that's actually happening uh so risk is
a potential problem that can be
predicted risk may or may not happen in
the future a proactive response plan is
formulated and kept ready to mitigate
risks so these are things you plan for
and the issue refers to a risk that is
occurring or about to happen there's no
response plan in place to solve an issue
you can only respond reactively to an
issue what are the various tools a
business analyst works on this is very
um company specific and so when you
start looking for work you start going
in for interviews you should start
really asking yourself what are these
companies looking for that I'm
interested in clearly if you work with
IBM you want to have your tools that are
Central to IBM and the IBM setup same
thing with Google um with you know just
across the whole field uh some of the
more basic ones um obvious an Excel
spreadsheet which isn't on this list uh
but your python your SQL you should
really know your SQL it's going to come
up and no matter what format you're in
uh your Tablo your exure your balsamic
all these are different platforms
there's a lot more out there but you
should be aware on which platforms your
proficiencies are on and those also that
you might not be proficient on but you
at least know what they do and what
their performance is so you can answer
questions and uh a lot of companies will
pay for you to be certified if their
platform isn't on your
list what are the various stages of a
business
project and we look at uh project
initiation project planning project
execution project control and monitoring
project closure and it's really
important to understand any one of these
in a little bit more detail than just
knowing the list what is feasibility
study a feasibility study is a method of
gauging the success rate of proposed
Business Solution it enables business
analysts to discover new business
opportunities and uh really a lot of
businesses when they're looking at a for
a business analyst this is really what
they want to know what's the feasibility
uh that is a very central question that
comes up in most business plans what's
the feasibility of doing something and
getting it done what is business model
analysis business model analysis is a
technique that helps you analyze if a
business is financially economic Ally
and socially viable or
not I know a number of contractors that
this is their sole career is to go in
and analyze ski resorts in Colorado to
find out whether it's going to make it
this year or not and what they need to
do to fix that uh so it's a very
high-end job Niche where you really need
to know your stuff and understand what
it
means what do you understand by
requirement differentiate between
requirements and needs
we look at requirements a requirement is
a targeted solution that is required to
achieve the set business objectives
business requirements are data used for
business processes needs needs are the
high level representation of the terms
and the result business needs include
identifying and comprehending the
business's goals and articulating its
strategic direction and you can think of
needs are what do we need to succeed
requirements are well these are the
things we need to put into place this is
what's required to achieve a business
objective suppose you have been given a
list of zip um PIN
codes from different countries using
those codes find the city and the state
names using
Excel and so if you're given a list of
zip codes PIN codes of various cities
from the US and India here's how you can
find the city and the country names
select all the codes go to the data tab
under data types select geography click
on the insert data option choosing City
from the field list click on the insert
data option and select state from the
field
list really you do need to know your way
around Excel no matter what other
packages you're working with uh Excel is
such a base package in business analysis
uh so much people are giving that back
and forth still it's still kind of a
baseline below our sales data that has
information on different items sold
across various regions and countries
what was the total revenue generated for
all the items in
India you can use the sum IF function to
find the total revenue generated from
India you can see here equals sum if and
then of course B2 to B100 India L2 to
l101 and that will give you uh the sum
you can also use a filter option to
filter the data only for India and use
subtotal by pressing alt plus equals
nice short uh hotkey to remember
there create a highlight table to
visualize the revenue generated from
offline and online sales for different
items across the region using
Tao now not all companies use tableblue
uh but it is becoming a very highly used
tool because it's so easy to use you
drag the region onto columns drag the
sales Channel and item type Fields onto
rows select the total revenue column and
drag it onto colure and label cards
select Square as the mark
type drag the total revenue filled onto
columns drag the total profit column
onto rows Place AUM type column onto
Coles under the size card place a total
profit drag the region column into the
filters card and select
Asia uh so one of the things about tblo
is it looks real complicated but it's
all drag and drop and so you should know
your way around about doing some very
simple drag and drops for doing your
query and summation and below is the
resulted plot so let's look at some more
questions but let's jump to a little
more intermediate level uh differentiate
between software development life cycle
and Project Life Cycle so we're looking
a little bit more hierarchial towards
the top of the list software development
life cycle helps with the development of
software products it consists of a
single software across multiple phases
here phases include requirement
Gathering coding operations maintenance
and
documentation where the Project Life
Cycle this enables you to develop a new
product in the business Project Life
Cycle consists of multiple software and
one customer scenario phases here are I
idea generation screening development
testing and Analysis how do you perform
risk management in your project so again
we're dealing with intermediate not just
how to pull tables across we going to
start analy I in things and the risk
management is a technique wherein risks
are identified avoided reduced assessed
and mitigate having the appropriate risk
management plan decreases losses and
optimizes decision making to enhance the
organization's performance how does risk
mitigation differ from risk
avoidance risk mitigation risk
mitigation is a plan to be executed when
a risk occurs when a risk occurs there
might be a business impact in the cost
cost incurred is high risk avoidance
whereas risk avoidance is carried out to
avoid the risk from occurring meanwhile
the business impact here is zero and the
cost is fully eliminated and you could
think about a brick and mortar store um
and they have shoplifting um you want to
mitigate as you want to avoid as much
shoplifting as you can uh but you can
only Frisk people at the door and have
security so much before you start losing
customers and so when you mitigate it
you're going to have to pay for your
lost merchandise where you avoid it you
have your security cameras and people
watching to stop uh people from uh
stealing things risk in this case can
mean loss of money spent uh badly spent
on equipment certifications there's all
kinds of areas where you want to
mitigate and avoid risk what are project
deliverables project deliverables
represent a collection of majoral
services and goods that are to be
delivered to the enduser in the project
completion stage this is so important we
start talking about any of our um uh uh
when you sign a contract any of our
online contracts cloud computing all of
that make sure you're very clear what
the deliverables are who owns it who is
the responsibility of the service and
the security around it those are all
very important questions to
know differentiate between the agile and
waterfall model uh two of our biggest or
most uh basic models used today the
agile model which is slowly taken over
especially in software uh the agile
model is adaptable to requirement
changes and has an incremental
approach in the agile model model
testing can be performed in every
phase with the waterfall model the
waterfall model is referred as a
structured software development
methodology changes in requirements are
difficult to implement meanwhile in the
waterfall model testing is performed
only in the Final
Phase and you can look at this as um a
lot of the software today has to be
ready to change quickly or in the
waterfall uh setup you're not looking
for fast changes you're looking for a
very solid uh it's going to work no
matter what kind of view this is
something that we can build it doesn't
going to have to make major changes but
it better work
correctly describe the different
analytical techniques like Moscow and
SWAT moscal analysis it is a
prioritization technique that highlights
a required significance question like is
it a must have or a should have could
the demand be made better would a
specific idea be useful in the future
are asked
here in the SWAT analysis it discovers
the strengths and weaknesses of a firm
and evaluates them as opportunities and
threats SWAT analysis consists of
strengths weaknesses opportunities and
threats and you can kind of think of it
as like the SWAT team coming in um to
you know you're worried about threats
here so we're talking about policing or
in Moscow really what is um what can we
get out of this you know is is this do
we have to have it to succeed is it
going to be useful in the future uh so
you're looking more for a general value
attached to it list various components
of strategy analysis for developing a
strategic plan for an organization the
vital components are Vision objectives
Mission strategies action plan what is
benchmarking benchmarking is a process
of evaluating an organization's measures
like the quality of policies programs
Etc against the standard
criteria it's so important to have that
Baseline of what are you measuring
against the Baseline might not even be a
very good one but you can't measure
something unless you have something to
measure it against it helps with the
measuring the performance of the company
you can recognize the areas of
improvement in a company and analyze how
other companies achieve other
objectives what is the best approach to
work with difficult
stakeholders a business analyst
interacts with many professionals during
his work few of the best approaches to
take into consideration while working
with difficult stakeholders
are before I even jump into this I have
a friend who is working with uh some
very high-end individuals who took their
private plane uh and he was supposed to
meet him at the in location when he
arrived they been in a fist fight while
on their private plane the stakeholders
had so much difficulty with some
particular aspect going on so
difficulties are going to arise
hopefully not at that level but things
happen and of course you want to just uh
assume work with anybody but you want to
listen patiently to the stakeholders
point of view respond to them politely
and
diplomatically have a one-on-one
discussion to make things more
precise comprehend their worries and be
transparent make sure to continuously
engage such difficult
stakeholders and I'm going to highlight
the last one because if you're working
with somebody who's difficult and you
just try to ignore them um one of the
things is that whatever problems are
arising they're just going to explode so
that is so important not to ignore the
ignore somebody who's being difficult uh
but the rest of it is stay focused stay
focused on what you're trying to
accomplish uh be goal driven this is a
great time to be goal driven not driven
by emot
or the problems that arise or how the
person
communicates name the different types of
agile
methodologies scrum uh you go get scrum
certified important thing to look into
if you haven't learn software
development and extreme programming XP
feature-driven development FDD Crystal
canb Dynamic systems development method
dsdm if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more there is an
agile just a ton of different
methodologies so knowing at least a few
of them inside and out and having a kind
of a general idea that the other ones
are out there is important so you at
least know what we're talking about when
someone comes up and talks about
agile describe the Gap analysis Gap
analysis refers to the analysis of
differences between the existing system
functionalities and the targeted
system the Gap indicates the amount of
work required to get the intended result
Gap analysis is a comparison between the
current and proposed
functionalities uh you can see here we
put together an action plan to go from
the current state to the desired State
how do you import text file data into Ms
Exel and remember Excel is one of those
things that has been around forever and
even though it's like the bottom barrel
of a lot of uh analysis that we do most
of our data starts in an Excel
spreadsheet um you know or comma
separated variable file that you then
end up with an Excel spreadsheet uh
given below is the employee text file it
has information about name age and
Company uh here's how you can import
this data into Excel go to the data tab
click on get data dropdown under from
files select text CSV select where the
text file is located in your system and
click on import click on load data
imported into Excel you've been given
sales data that has information on the
cell of different items across the world
below is the data create a pivot table
to analyze the profit of all the items
in each region now remember a pivot
table is a table of Statistics that
summarizes the data uh of a more
extensive table so it takes a full data
sheet and we're just going to bring
we're going to focus zoom in on
something that's what the pro the pivot
table means and if we want to go ahead
and do this we do is we go ahead and
select a cell in the table go to insert
and click on pivot table in the create
pivot table box choose existing
worksheet to place your pivot table drag
region and item type onto rows drag
total profit onto values sort the sum of
the total profit column using the sales
table find the percentage contribution
of Cosmetics to the total revenue and
total profit create a pivot table by
dragging item type on to rows select the
revenue and profit column under values
right click on the revenue value under
show value as select percentage of grand
total right click on a profit value
under show value as choose percentage of
grand total and you can see here when we
do that we end up with Cosmetics made a
14.03% contributions to the total
revenue and an 18.94% contribution to
the total profit how do you create a
dual axis chart in Tabo drag the order
data onto columns and convert it into
continuous year drag total revenue onto
rows and total profit to the right
corner of the view until you see the
light green rectangle synchronize the
right Axis by right clicking on the
profit axes under the marks card change
some total revenue to bar and some total
profit to line and adjust the size and
color they're lots of fun to play with
as you start getting into
these using the sales data Create A View
to show the total unit sold and the
profit generated ated from each item
which item sold the leas and has the
least profit so we'll go ahead and load
an Excel file data in tblo
desktop drag unit sold onto columns and
item type column onto rows place the
total profit column under colure and
choose the desired color palette sort
the unit sold axes in descending
order you can see here it produces a
very quick um bug figure shows the fruit
sold and the least and had the least
amount of
profit create a map to show the Unis
sold and the profit generated from
different Middle East and North Africa
items drag country onto the detail card
place a total profit column under the
size drag unit sold under color in the
filters card drag the region column and
select Middle East and North
Africa Bahrain had the maximum number of
units sold at the same time Iran made
the full amount of profit
create a visualization to analyze the
total revenue and the unit sold for
clothes meat and baby food across
different regions in 2006 in
2017 drag the unit sold field on the
columns drag the region and item type
fields on the T row under the Cure card
place a total revenue column drag item
type onto filters and choose clothes
meat and baby food drag the order date
column on to filters and select 2016 and
2017 meat had the highest unit sold and
made the maximum profit now with any of
these Tabo it's good if you have your
own hands on for this um so it that's an
important thing to note we kind of
zoomed in on tblo again there's a lot of
other companies out there using a lot of
other packages so if you're not familiar
with tblo but you're able to do this in
another package uh that's a good thing
so at least you know what we're talking
about and you've had that handson let's
go ahead and jump to some advanced level
questions what is requirement
prioritization name the different
techniques used for it requirements
priorization focuses on allocating
requirements depending on the business
urgencies this is essential for the
project to run well requirement
prioritization enables various teams to
understand what is important and work in
sync with the business
needs there are several techniques used
for requirement
prioritization we had Moscow Technique
we mentioned that earlier the
requirements are grouped based on must
mandatory should high priority could not
necessary but preferred and would
suggested for the
future ranking method here you give each
requirement a distinct numerical value
based on its
importance of course this is at 100
um oh well here's kind of similar to
ranking is the $100 method multiple
stakeholders get a no uh notional $100
to distribute a among the requirements
so the $100 method is pretty similar to
what the ranking method is top 10
requirements in this approach from a
large set the stakeholders simply pick
their top 10 requirements this is very
popular um there's a lot of help books
out there about getting things done they
say write everything that you want to
accomplish um put them on 3x5 cards and
narrow it down to five do those five
because once you've conquered those five
then you can move on to the next ones
name the critical agile metrix that
should be considered by a business
analyst Sprint
burndown uh so the Sprint burndown is
the chart we use when you're tracking
usually it's in scrum is where that
usually comes from the scrum uh setup uh
but it's a chart of the work to be
completed and what's still going on uh
you have your work category allocation
the
velocity the cumulative flow diagram
defect removal awareness time coverage
defect resolution time explain
bpmn bpmn business process model and
notation Gateway controls the flow of
interaction and sequence of processes it
is a flowchart technique Which models
the end to end business process step the
four essential elements of bpmn are flow
objects events activities gateways
connecting objects sequence messages
Association
swim Lanes pool or Lane artifacts data
object group annotation list the
elicitation techniques the elicitation
process is about Gathering requirements
from users and stakeholders listed below
are a few techniques that are used to
collaborate with users or
clients
interviews uh I don't know how many
times I've been on the phone calling uh
competition um potential clients to ask
questions uh so one of the elicitation
techniques is to ask questions if you're
going to call clients to ask questions
it can a lot of terms also turn into
additional
sales document analysis focus group
prototyping brainstorming my favorite
brainstorming um all these are important
I I just kind of highlight a few of them
that I tend to get stuck in observations
and
workshops again workshops are a great
sales technique also so as you're doing
your business analysis and you're
bringing people into a workshop and do
observations in the workshop and working
specifically with these people they turn
into potential business growth um I tell
you what if you're a shareholder and
someone's doing a business analysis and
they turn around and uh generate a
$30,000 sale for your company um they're
in you know you've already earned your
you've already earned your pay and
you're doing what you like which is
business analysis interface analysis
questionnaire and Survey uh
questionnaire and surveys my least
favorite but they are the most popular
because they're the easiest to pump out
list of documents needed by a business
analyst initiation document project
Vision document use cases system
requirements specifications document
business requirement document
requirements traceability Matrix
functional requirement document use case
specifications document gap analyst
document describe how you would approach
a
project here's a basic project approach
outline which you can use with respect
to different
situations identifying the project goal
formulating the work plan defining the
requirements collaborating with other
teams tracking the project documenting
the
progress and really when you um start
designing your project
approach encompassing all the things
listed in here is so important with the
shareholders uh if you I mean it's great
if you can identify your project goal
and that's probably the most important
thing because if you don't have a goal
you might as well walk away um but if
you don't have the rest uh well how are
you formulating the work plan defining
the requirements um collaborating with
other teams that is such a a big step uh
because we're going from everything
being on paper and trying to figure out
what you're going to do to actually
doing it and then tracking and finally
documenting very important for the
shareholders and what goes back to the
top differentiate an alternate flow and
exception flow in a use case diagram
from a basic
flow basic flow represents the operation
of activities as required by the company
in a use case alternate flow as the name
suggests is an alternate solution used
in a system failure case different steps
are used to complete the goals of a use
cases exception flow refers to the
various steps executed in case of errors
this does not lead to achieving the
required goal of a use case critical
aspects of creating analytical reporting
analytical reporting is a type of
business reporting which provides data
analysis information and recommendations
it enables people to use data to make
decisions to create analytical reporting
the following points should be kept in
mind comprehend business analysis
display your analysis skills think
critically and I'm going to throw in
here uh the term from Big Data map and
reduce uh really when we're doing a
business
analysis you don't want to give them a
massive amount of information you want
to reduce it down to something that they
can see in a single graph uh a very
simple set of notes um and you need to
think critically you need to really make
it uh what is it that the shareholders
want that's going to make them
understand why this is is important to
the business and what does the business
get out of it what is kban kban helps
agile teams and Visually managing work
through processes it works as a
scheduling system in agile just in time
production the can band methodology is
all about real-time communication of
capacity and full transparency of work
the canb board describes the current
development
status and of course when you're working
with canb you got to be very careful
about uh uh inspiring versus coaching
versus
micromanaging it really can end up in a
micromanaging setup or you want to you
want to watch out for that but you also
need to track everything a basic canb
board has three-step workflow has to
Todo in progress and done however
depending on a team size structure and
objectives the workflow can be mapped to
meet any particular team's unique
process State the key differences
between BRD and
SRS BRD business requirements documents
is a highlevel functional specification
of software BRD is a formal document to
describe the requirement provided by the
client business analysts create this
post their interaction with the clients
SRS system requirement specification is
a highlevel functional and Technical
specification of software SRS describes
the software's functions and
non-functional requirements that are
needed to be developed whereas SRS is
created by the systems
Architects what is perito analysis the
perto analysis helps in crucial
decision-making it helps in prioritizing
decisions identifying the most relevant
and the least decision concerning the
overall goal is also known as the 8020
rule as per this rule 82% of the
Project's benefit arises from 20% of the
work vice versa 80% of the case problem
can be due to 20% of the causes
differentiate between the V model and
the fish
model when we talk about the V model it
is an sdlc model where the execution of
processes happens sequentially in a
vshape at every stage the same person
reviews but other testers will do
software testing in the last step V
model consumes less time and
cost the fish model is similar to The V
model but with more multiple
verification
teams every stage is tested by another
team for completeness and correctness
the fish model is comparatively very
costly and timec consuming which makes
sense because if you have uh multiple
tests on each stage for multiple teams
they have to all be spun up on it and so
you're literally more than doubling the
work because you also have to track all
that given the cells data create a chart
to show each Region's country that made
the highest revenue create a pivot table
by dragging the region and Country onto
rows place a total revenue column under
values right click on the country value
select the filter options and choose top
10 choose top one as shown above and
click on okay and you can see here is
the pivot table that you will get using
the sales data find all the countries
where the total units of fruits sold
offline were less than 3,000 you need to
use an advanced filter option in
Microsoft exile to solve this
problem below is a critical based on the
question we have go to the data tab
select Advanced filter option choose
copy to another location give your
criteria range and the copy to location
click on
okay here's the final result as we can
see below let's create a pivot table to
find which countries from each region
made the lowest amount profit create a
pivot table by dragging the region and
the country into rows Place The Profit
column under values right click on any
country value select the filter option
and choose top 10 choose bottom one and
click on
okay and then let's create a filled map
to analyze the total revenue and profit
generated from beverages in North
America using Tabo drag country under
detail card place a total revenue column
under the text drag total profit under
Cure in the filters card drag the region
column and select North America in the
filters card drag the the item type
column and select
Beverages and you can see from the below
map you can see that Greenland and the
maximum revenue and profit generated
from beverages in North
America who
knew using tblue how will you display
the top five and bottom five items based
on
profit drag the item type filled on rows
and total profit onto columns right
click on the item type column to create
a set give a name to the set and select
the top tab to choose the top five items
by su total
profit create a set for the bottom five
items by some total profit select both
the sets right click to create a
combined set give a name to the set and
choose all members in both sets drag the
new set on the filters and the total
profit onto
calore the above graph depicts the
Cosmetics made the highest profit while
fruits made the lowest and really when
we're talking about tools like
Tao uh or if you're targeting companies
working in r or you're targeting
companies working in Python you should
be able to quickly do these kind of
displays in any of those packages that
you're focused on uh tblo is one of the
biggest ones out there right now because
it is a paid for service but it's also
um very robust and easy to use and uses
less programming on the back end uh so
just a quick side note on there roll
your sleevs up if you if this does not
look right to you you're not able to get
through some of these things make sure
you are if that's what you're targeting
in a company for an interview in this
video we are focusing on chat GPT and
its groundbreaking role in data
analytics in a world where data is the
new gold understanding and analyzing
this wealth of information is crucial
but as the volume of data grows
exponentially traditional analysis
methods are being pushed to their limits
enter CH JP a revolutionary AI developed
by open AI That's transforming how we
approach data analytics but what makes
Chad gbt stand out in the crowded field
of data analytics tools how can it not
only streamline complex processes but
also uncover insights that were
previously hidden in plain site stay
tuned as we unrel the capabilities of
chat G share real world applications and
show you how it's being used by analysis
and businesses alike to make smarter
datadriven decisions and whether you are
a data scientist a business professional
or just a tech Enthusiast curious about
the future of aii in data analytics this
video is for you so let's dive in and
discover how CH GPT is not just
revolutionizing data analytics but also
how we understand and interact with the
vast Universe of data and don't forget
to hit that like button subscribe and
ring the bell to stay updated on all our
future Explorations into the fascinating
world of technology now let's get
started and unlock the potential of chat
GPD for data analytics together so guys
an Excel data analyst always looks for
ways is to improve their efficiency and
gain deeper insights from the data
that's where chat jbt comes in handy so
chat jbt is an AI powered language model
that can assist you in various tasks
including Excel based data analysis and
for that data analysis let's dive into
some demos to see how it works so guys
as you can see this is the chat jpt 4
and you could see this has the support
of D browsing and Analysis and usage
limits May apply like we have the
version
that has some usage limits and for the
data I have downloaded the data from the
kar I will provide you the link in the
description if you want to download the
same data you can and I have that in my
downloads so this is the data that we'll
be using so the first thing we'll be
doing is data cleaning and preparation
so firstly let's explore data cleaning
and preparation before diving into
analysis it's essential to ensure our
data is clean and ready for processing
so for that we will write a prompt in
chat jpt and ask him to clean the data
chat jpt has the feature to insert the
files provide the Excel file to the chat
jpt and we will ask him that can you
help me identify and remove duplicates
in this Excel spreadsheet so let's ask
him can you help me identify and remove
duplicates duplicates from this Excel
spreadsheet from the
provided
Excel spread sheet you could see that JY
has started generating the response and
he is telling us that he can definitely
help us with that and he's analyzing
that so you could see that J has
provided us the response so let's first
go to uh
spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet
order number quantity
ordered price of each quantity and Order
lines so you could see that first jart
GPT has encountered an error and that is
with the corrector and coding Mis patch
and then he has loaded the spreadsheet
successfully with the second attempt and
you could see that he has provided a
like the smaller or the briefer version
of the spreadsheet that is the data set
consist of sales data with column such
as order number quantity order price
each order line sales order date status
so he asking us could you specify how
you would like to identify duplicates
for example should be considered a row a
duplicate if all its values match and
row exactly or are this specifically
columns we should focus on to determine
duplicates so we should or here we'll be
focusing on the column section so here
we want to
identify column
section so is asking which columns they
should identify duplicates so we want
the duplicates in order number
the CH GPD has started analyzing the
spreadsheet so you could see that CH G
has Pur justed the response that they
have identified a total of
287 rows in the spreadsheet that have
duplicates based on the order number
column so this indicates that multiple
rows share the same order number
suggesting there might be different
items or transactions within the same
order so would you like to proceed by
removing these dupli
while keeping either the first or last
Ur of each order number or do you have
another approach in mind for handling
these duplicates so before identifying
the duplicates what we'll do is we'll
first get rid of the extra spaces so
we'll ask chat jpt that first
find the Extra
Spaces in the
spreadsheet and
help us remove
them so you could see that it has
started analyzing
it so he is asking us that would you
like to proceed with any further
cleaning or data manipulation yes we
want to proceed further with data
cleaning only and now we will treat
treat all the blank cells if there are
any now treat all the blank
cells if there are
any so the spreadsheet contains blank
cells in the following columns with the
respective counts of blank entries that
is address line two has 2521 blank sales
than the state so depending on
preference or the requirements of data
analysis we can treat these blank Sal in
several ways such as filling them with a
placeholder value that is not provided
using a specific value that makes sense
for data that is example a default state
or Tory but potentially leaving them as
if blanks carry meaningful information
in the context of your data so what we
will do we will provide a
placeholder provide a placeholder
instead that
is not provided or not applicable okay
so you would see in that CH has
responded that it has replaced the plank
cells in the columns that is address
line two state postal code and territory
with the placeholder node provided so
you could see there's a verification
sample showing the updates so this is
how you could clean the data and now
with Chad jpt you can quickly identify
and eliminate duplicates in your Excel
spreadsheet using buil-in functions and
formulas saving your time and effort so
that would be done by the chat GPT and
you can download the Excel file from the
chat GPD only after that you can just
ask him that provide me the output or
the resulted spreadsheet so if we talk
about now data analysis and
visualization let's delve into that so
Excel offers powerful tools for
analyzing and visualizing data and chat
gbt can help you make them most of them
so for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat jpt and we'll write for example
example will write please create a pivot
table and a corresponding chart to
analyze sales performance by region so
let's see like this prompt what output
does chat Jey show to us so let's ask
him please create a PR
table and a corresonding
chart to
analyze sales performance by region
so you would see that jut has started
analyzing the data and the spreadsheet
and you could see that the pivot table
below shows the sales performance by
region or the territory so this table
indicates that the EMA region has the
highest s performance followed by
regions where the territory was not
provided then Apec and finally Japan so
now let's create a chart to visually
represent this sales performance by
region we could see that it has provided
a chart that is a bar chart illustrating
the sales performance by
Ty so you could see the guys that it has
provided us the analysis and J jpd can
guide you through the process of
creating pivot tables charts and other
visualizations in Excel enabling you to
gain valuable insights from your data
with ease so let's move to Advanced
analysis and automation so lastly we
will explore Advanced analysis and
automation so Excel capabilities extend
beyond basic functions and chat jpd can
help you leverage its full potential and
for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat jpt that can you assist me in
building a forecasting model to predict
future sales based on historical data
present in the spread sheeet so let's
see what Chad j respond to us so let's
ask him
can
you assist
me in
building a forecasting
model to predict future
sales based on historical
data so let's see what chj respond to us
so you could see that building a
forecasting model to prct future sales
based on historical data involves
several steps
so for this you have to prepare the data
select a model train the model evaluate
the model and make predictions so let's
start by preparing the data we'll
aggregate sales by order date to create
a Time series of total daily sales then
we'll choose a model based on data's
characteristics so we
will grant the permission to chat chpt
to proceed with the steps so we started
analyzing the data
so you could see that that the data has
been prepared into a Time series of
total daily sales and before choosing a
forecasting model it's helpful to
visualize the sales time series to
understand its characteristics such as
Trend and seasonality so jjt has looted
a daily sales data and then he has given
the visual Trends and the possible
seasonal patterns
and the next steps would include testing
for stationarity model selection and
parameter touring model training and
then forecasting so you could follow all
these steps with the help of chat GPT
and could create a forecasting model if
you want we can move to the next step so
you could like provide a prom to the
chat gy that move
to or proceed with Next Step
so step by step JJ will provide you a
forecasting model or it will help you
create a forecasting model as you can
see it is started analyzing it to the
augmented Dy Fuller that is ADF test
gives up a P value of approximately
0.0033 since this P value is less than
the common significance level of 0.05 we
can reject the null hypthesis that the
time Series has a unit R meaning the
time series is stationary so you could
see that he asking us shall we proceed
with the Sima model parameter selection
yes here is the model parameter
selection so you could select any based
on the trends and the bar graphs ploted
by the chat
G so you could see guys that the chat G
has analyzed the spreadsheet and
provided the response that the grid
search for the optimal Sima parameters
based on the lower inform information
Criterion suggest the best fit model
uses the parameter 011 and for ARA and
0112 that is for the seasonal component
so you could see that it has provided
the model and the parameters now he
asking us shall we move on to
forecasting future sales with this model
yes proceed with that so you could see
that with chjs assistance you can build
complex forecasting models in Excel
allowing you to make informed decision
and plan for the future effectively so
chat JP is a valuable tool for Excel
users and data analysis offering
assistance in data cleaning analysis
visualization and Automation and by
integrating Chad jip in your Excel
workflows you can enhance your
productivity and uncover new insights
from your data so you can try J gbt for
Excel data analytics today and take your
Excel skills to the new level and you
would see that uh there's an error in
the analyzing and he has encounter an
error while trying to plot the forecast
with its confidence intervals so this
type of error can occur due to data type
issues particularly when handling data
indices in forecast and despite the seup
the forecasting process using the ca
model was completed and we were able to
generate forecast for the next 12 months
unfortunately due to the plotting issue
he couldn't visually display it so we'll
ask him can you try once
again so you could see that this time ch
has provided us the forecast for the
next 12 months that is the forecast have
been successfully ploted along with the
historical daily data so here we have
our forecast model and with the chat J's
assistance we can move with other
analysis also in this session we are
going to learn about databases how data
is stored in relational databases and
we'll also look at some of the popular
databases finally we'll understand
various SQL commands on my SQL server
now let's get started with what is a
database so according to Oracle a
database is an organized collection of
structured information or data that is
typically stored electronically in a
computer system a database is usually
controlled by a database management
system or
dbms so it is a storage system that has
a collection of data relational
databases store data in the form of
tables that can be easily retrieved
managed and updated you can organize dat
data into tables rows columns and index
it to make it easier to find relevant
information now talking about some of
the popular
databases we have mySQL database we also
have Oracle database then we have mongod
DV which is a no SQL database next we
have Microsoft SQL Server next we have
Apache cassendra which is a free and
open source no SQL database and finally
we have postest SQL now let's learn what
is SQL so SQL is a domain specific
language to communicate with databases
SQL was initially developed by
IBM most databases use structured query
language or SQL for writing and querying
data SQL commands help you to store
process analyze and manipulate databases
with this let's look at what a table is
so this is how a table in a database
looks like so here you can see the name
of the table is players on the top you
can see the column names so we have the
player ID the player name the country to
which the player belongs to and we also
have the goals scored by each of the
players so these are also known as
fields in a
database here each row represents a
record or a tle so you have the player
ID which is 103 here the name of the
player is Daniel he is from England and
the number of goals here scored is seven
so you can use SQL commands to query
update insert records and do a lot of
other tasks now we'll see what the
features of SQL are SQL lets you access
any information stored in a relational
database with SQL queries data is
extracted from the database in a very
efficient way the structured query
language is compatible with all database
systems from Oracle IBM to Microsoft and
it doesn't require much coding to manage
databases now we will see applications
of SQL SQL is used to create a database
Define its structure implement it and
lets you perform many functions SQL is
also used for maintaining an already
existing database SQL is a powerful
language for entering data modifying
data and extracting data in a database
SQL is extensively used as a client
server language to connect the front end
with the back end the supporting the
client server architecture SQL when
deployed as data control language DCL
helps protect your database from
unauthorized access so welcome to the
demo part of the SQL project so in this
we will do digital music store analysis
okay so this SQL project is for the
beginners so what you will learn from
this uh project main thing is like so
what's the objective of this project
this particular project so this project
is for beginners and we'll teach you how
to analyze the music playlist database
and you can examine the data set with
SQL and help the store understand its
business growth by answering simple
questions so as you can see I will show
you so I have three set of questions
first one is easy okay and the second
one is
moderate and the third one is advanced
level so we have three set of questions
easy set moderate and the Advan
okay so every set is of three three
questions I guess yes every said there
is three three questions so okay in easy
one there are five so we have 5 + 3 8 8
+ 3 11 we have 11 questions to solve
okay from this you will understand how
you can you know analyze data with SQL
how you can extract something from
database how you can store something
like
this
okay so and one more thing I will show
you the schema of the particular uh data
set which we will you know soon we will
restore so we have the tables in this
artist album track media type genre
invoice line invoice customer employee
ID playlist playlist track and all okay
so this is the music playlist database
schema so without any further Ado let
me create one database so here just
right click create
database
okay here I will
write
music okay and Save
so now our database is created okay so
if you will go to
schema and if you go to tables there is
no tables in it means there is no there
is database but nothing is there the
database is empty so now what I will do
just go to your database just right
click here you can see the restore
option okay
restore so format as it is then here
file name go to this music store
database I will put this database Link
in the description box below don't worry
open then
restore process started process complete
some people will face this uh that the
process is failed or something okay so
for that what you have to do just go to
file then
preferences here you have to set the
path spary path okay see I am using the
15th version okay so I have set the path
here also and this also but you have to
set this path is important okay if you
will not set this edv Advanced Ser path
it's fine but this path is most
important
okay but for the future reference I have
added on the both so what you have to do
you have to just see where you will find
this path just go to this piece
then OS then program
files here you will find this post G SQL
then I'm using
C15 15 then bin so you have to
copy this
path right have to just copy
it and paste it here and then select
this one after that just save you
won't find any failed thing okay the
process will complete right so now let's
move forward and see the tables okay
it's still empty why just refresh it see
now you can see all the you know columns
in my tables okay
so what I will do for the checking I
will run one query here okay let me
close it okay I will write here select
star from
album okay let me run
it so now as you can see here my table
is working fine everything seems
good
okay so now what we will do we will
solve question one by
one okay so the first question let's see
the first question easy one who is is
the senior most employee based on job
title
okay who is the senior
most okay so I will
write
here like first question is
who is the
senior
Most
employe B L
on job
title okay so this is our
question so we know we have the table
name called employer so we will select
that table first so I will write here
select stuff
from
employe
so you should know uh which table
should to select okay so here as you can
see in
this question there is you know uh word
employee who is the senior most employee
based on the job title most employee
means employee is an employee table
right
so I will run
it
okay so what I will do I will just
select this and run it okay so now you
can see there in employer there is
employee ID last name first name title
report levels bu date higher date and
all the details of the
particular
okay so we will do so there is one more
thing you can see the levels okay level
one level two so we have to who is the
senior most employee based on the job
title so what I will do I will write
here
order
by levels and decreasing order
okay so first I will do so now you can
see the levels are in the descending
order from
senior to this okay L7 to
L1 so what we want we want only one uh
employee name so what I will write here
limit is
one okay I will copy this and done it
okay so now you can see the last name is
Madan moan sorry moan Madan this is last
name this is first name so moan Madan is
the senior most employee based on the
job de so question first
is done so the second question is which
countries have the most
invoices okay first I will write down
the question
which country has
the have the
most have the most
enoes
okay so for this
what we have to do see just first check
first we have to check from which table
you know we will get the solution so
here you can see the word
invoices okay so we have one table
invoice and invoice line we have to
select it from this
okay so I will write
here select stuff
from
invoice
okay so we have customer ID invoice date
billing address billing city billing
State and
everything so here you can see we have
the billing country as well okay because
we need the country name so we will take
this column right so I will write here
so I will write
select we change it
select
count
start from
the select star
billing country
from
invoice Group
by billing
country so why I doing this group by
because as you can see uh we have USA
multiple times USA USA USA then Canada
also and the other countries as well so
from this I will get only the one okay I
will group them and I will get the one
fine so from this we will uh get the
count so after this I will write
order P so here I will
write let
see see descending okay let me me run
it so now you can see the billing this
is the billing order okay so or you can
see the on voices USA got the
131 and Canada 76 Brazil 61 if I will
write here again the limit one what I
will
get see
USA we got the
USA so USA is the country which have the
most
invoices okay if you will remove this
limit so you will
get the other country as well second in
Canada third is Brazil and like this
okay and the third question is what are
the top three values of total
invoices okay again we need the same
table okay first I will write the
question third question is what
are are
the top three values of total
invoices top three
value of
total invoices okay I know I can just
solve this question by the second one
but but I want to do it from the
starting
okay so first I will take select stuff
from
invoice let me run
it so first we will sort the data here I
will write order
by
total because the last you know this is
a table name okay
total and the descending
order so first I will
select so we need just the top three so
first I will do everyone know limit
three
okay
okay so here I have done I have wrote
this St
that is why it's giving me the all the
values if I want this only this value so
I can write select
total from invoice order by
this okay I will say and run it so I
have this total like 23.75 999 and 19.8
and 19.8 so these are the top three
values of total
invoices okay so here the fourth
question is which city has the best
customer we would like to throw a
promotional music festival in the city
we made the most money write a quy that
returns one city that has the highest
sum of invoice total return both the
city name and some of the all invoice
total so let me write the question first
okay I'm writing question for you know
your better understanding
okay question fourth
which
city has the
best
customers we
would like to throw a
party uh
promotional promotional music
festival in the city
we made the most
money we made
the most
money write
a
query that it does one
city that has
the
highest sum of invoices
has sum of
invoices
Total return
return
both the
city
name and
sum of
all
devices okay
so we have this question okay so which
city has the best customer we would like
to throw a promotional music festival in
the city we made the most money write a
query that returns one city that has the
highest sum of invoice Total return both
the city name and the sum of all the
invoices okay so first what we will do
we will
select select stuff
from invoice
okay
sorry we select this okay so first we
will select the building City we have to
focus on this and the total in this two
table we have to just focus on okay so
here I will write
some
of
total as
invoice
total comma
billing
city from
invoice so this time we will do group
by
billing city because we need the city
names uh then I will add order
buy
invoice
total in the descending
order seems good select some total as
invoice Total Building City from invoice
building okay so let me select
this so as you can see the highest
billing city is
parag Prague and the best customer is
from the parag
city okay so which city has the best
customer obviously parag pragu or sorry
for the you know
mispronunciation okay so this is how we
have solved our fourth question as well
okay because written both the city name
and the sum of all the inv you know
these is the city names and then inv
voice total okay moving forward to our
fifth
question which is again the long one who
is the best customer the customer who
has spent the most money will be the
declared the best customer right a query
that Returns the person who has spent
the most
money okay so I will write here
who is the
best customer
one the
customer who has
spent the
most
money will be
dear the best
customer so write a
quiry right that returns that
Returns
the
person who has
spent most money
okay yeah so who is the best customer
the customer who has spent the most
money will be declared the best write a
query that Returns the person who has
spent the most money okay so for this we
have to take this customer data
custom table data okay so I will write
as
select stuff
from
customer okay I will select this and I
will run
it okay so this is
our know data table data of customer
okay so we have the country facts emails
state city address last name first name
okay so as you can see there is
nothing uh like no detail of invoice or
the money okay which have spent by the
customer so what we will do we will look
at our schema so now what we can do if
we can't solve a particular question
from with one table we have to you know
join the table to the other table so
here we have to join customer table to
invoice table so in this you can see
there is customer ID and here also
customer ID so on the basis of customer
ID we can join the join both the table
and with the help of this total we will
sort out the uh that guy okay that
customer
right so for this I will
write here select
customer
Dot
customer ID
comma
customer
DOT first
name comma
customer dot last name because we need
need the full name of that guy
comma sum
invoice do
total as
total
okay okay let me can be pause okay I
don't need the search
pad
right then I will write
from
customer okay my bad
then
join
invoice
on customer
Dot
customer
idals
to
invoice
do customer
ID
then I need Group
by okay
Group
by
customer
Dot customer ID after
this uh uh let me order it by the
descending order so the most you know
spend customer will come
up so I will write here
order order by
total the descending
order then
limit equals to
1 fine let me run it let's see what
output
should
okay okay some error is
coming okay sorry
okay so as you can see the customer ID
is five the first name is a the last
name is ma our mother is spent the
highest value
14454 and two so who is the best
customer mad AR mad sorry my bad our mad
right our mother has spent the most
money okay so this is how we are done
with our easy set of questions now let's
jump into the moderate one okay so let
me write the question first for the
moderate so I will write
here moderate
questions so these analytics skill help
you in the data analytics to become a
data analyst or to become a data
scientist
okay so the question first is
write
query to
return
okay write query to
return the
email qu to
return the
email comma first
name first
name comma last name
and
genre of
all rock music
listen Okay then
return
your
list
ordered alphabetic
ically by
email
starting with a okay
let
yeah so for
this
okay let me open this
first yeah
okay fine so first what I will
do so now in this question as you can
see we need the we have to return the
email first name and the last name and
the genre of all rock music listener so
if you will see select stuff from
customer okay be run
this and if I will see there is no
column name genre okay if I will show
you the schema of this see the genre is
here and the customers is here okay we
need the first name last name and the
email ID and the genre okay and the
genre is Will should be Rock okay so
what I can do I can connect this genre
with track that because here is also
track ID and here is also track ID then
track ID to invoice line then invoice
line to invoice then invoice to customer
with the customer ID okay this pattern I
have to
follow right so for this I will
write select just copy
this okay just follow the
steps
select
distinct email comma first name
comma last
name
from
customer
join
invoice
on
customer
Dot customer
ID equals
to in invoice
Dot
customer
ID then
join
invoice _
line
on
invoice do invoice
ID okay then invoice
underscore
ID then
where
track ID should be
in here I will
do
select track
ID okay from
track then
join then join
johnra
yeah
on track dot genre
dot ID equs
to genre
dot genre I
where this is important
genre
name
like
rock because we need as you can see
righty to return this is this and genre
of all rock music list
business okay
rock right
then order
by
email okay before that let me show you
this track okay select star from track
okay let me show you this table
you can see the name the track ID album
ID Media type genre ID
okay then the composer this this this
bytes and the unit
price
right okay so you know this we have then
this customer okay invoice ID we to
right fine so now what I will do
I will just select this
and okay invoice ID okay invoice ID is
ambiguous here I have to
write
invoice
line do invoice ID
okay let me now
run let me we run it okay one more join
genre on track. genre ID there is entry
for table genre but it cannot be
referenc from this part of the query
okay
okay as you can see the here the table
name is genre uncore ID that was the
mistake
okay one more genre.
name spelling
mistake sorry my bad guys no isues it
happens okay now you can see we have all
the people who love rock music and we
have the email then first name then the
last name see Adan Mitchell Alexandra
Roa a
grber like this cam Dan Edward like this
okay so there are total 59 people who
loves rock music from this particular
database okay now question
two question two is let's Okay first let
me show you let's invite the artists who
have written the most rock music data
set write a query that Returns the
artist name and the total track count on
the top 10 rock bands okay so
let's
invite the
artist who
have
written the
most rock
music in our data set
so
write write a
query that
Returns the artist
name
and and the total track count
of track count of
top
10
dock
bands so now what we need here okay let
me do
this so what we need here so let's
invite the artists who have the written
the most rock music first we need the
artist okay and the second is Rock music
then we need track okay and the total
count total track count means we will
get from the track so
here we have track column track uh table
and we have the artist so now let's see
the schema part so we have we need
genre
okay for the you know uh rock music then
we have
to combine this with the track ID
because genre ID is there from track ID
to album because we need the artist name
see artist ID and artist ID so this is
how we have to connect the table
now so for this I will write here just
follow the steps
select artist
dot artist
ID
comma artist dot name
comma
count
artist. artist
ID
as number of songs because we need the
total number okay who have written the
most rock
music number of
songs fine
from
track now we have to
join
album
on on
album do album ID
equals to
track
dot
album
ID okay then we have to join the artist
with artist
ID so
join artist
column on the basis of
Artist Artist ID equals to then
album to album.
artist ID okay so here I have joined the
artist to the album colum
table okay then I have to join johra to
the track table with the track table
okay so here I will write
join
genre
on genre
do genre
ID equals
to JRA
ID okay sorry try
ID track doj
ID okay so here I will write
where where genre
dot
name
like
shock
okay rock fine then I will Group by
my B group
by
artist do artist ID I need the ID as
well then order
by order
by
number
of songs
the descending then limit I need only 10
rock bands limit will be
10 let me run it
okay let me run
it okay
album
okay now let me run it okay now you can
see this guy let Zeppelin Artis ID is 22
and wrote the most songs 144 then You2
122 d purple 92 then then this this this
then this okay so this is
how we solved our second
question right so now the third
question okay return all the track names
names that have a song Length longer
than the average
song Length return the name and the
millisecond of the each
track ordered by the song
Length
okay so first I will write this
question
Q3 so return of all the
track names
that have a
song
Length longer
than the
average song length Okay as we return
all the track names that have the song
Length longer than the average song
Length okay
then return return
the name and
milliseconds for each track
fine after that order by them order by
the
songs with
the
longest song
listed first
okay fine so we have to return all the
track names that have song length and
the
okay first we will find the total length
of this songs then we will do the we
then we will put the V Clause to find
out the
particular uh longest song okay so this
is this will do in the two you know step
first you will find the average stke
length Okay so I will write here
select select name comma
milliseconds
okay
from
track
where milliseconds
here I will write
select
average from the
millisecond
okay then I will write here
as
average
track length
okay then here I will write from
track after this I will write
here order
by
milliseconds I need in there Des sending
order
okay so let me run it
so now you can see see first I will uh
read it again so return all the track
names that have a song Length longer
than the average song Length written the
name and the millisecond for each stack
order by the songs with the longest song
listed first okay so this is the longest
song okay so we have all the songs which
are the longer than the average song
Length
right so now moving forward we have jump
into the advanced set of questions okay
so now we will do the Advan questions
okay so let's see first find how much
amount spent by each customer on artist
write a query to return customer name
artist name and tot SP okay so first we
will write down the
questions okay then question
one question one okay okay
find how
much
amount
spent by
each
customer on
artist write a
quiry to
return customer
name comma artist this
name comma total
spent and total
spent okay so how to solve this so first
find which artist has earned the most
according to the invoice lines okay
first uh let me show you the schema okay
we need the artist name we need the
customer name and we need the total
spend okay okay with the invoice line
because the quantity should be there
okay so first we'll see how to join
these three table artist table customer
invoice and invoice line like this okay
this is how we
will you know join the table fine so now
I will tell you the you know steps so
first find which artist has earned the
most according to the invoice line okay
the second now use the art artist to
find which customer spent the most on
the artist so for this query you will uh
be need to use an invoice invoice line
track customer album and the artist
table so just remember this one is
tricky because the total spent in the
invoice
table right let me show you so total
spent on the invoice
table might not be a single product so
that is why I was saying we need the
quantity
so we need the invoice line table to
find out how many each product was
purchased then we have to multiply this
by the price of each artist okay fine so
now so this is the lengthy one I will
just you know write it for you and get
back to
you yeah so this is how you can see okay
Group by five I have wrote this you can
just you know write it
okay like this okay we took artist name
then sum of invoice line unit price into
invoice line the quantity that I showed
you okay we have multiply this total
with the quantity okay then we joined
the table track with invoice album with
track artist with album okay so now
let's run
it yeah
so now you can see this H or queen
amount spent 27 the customer ID is this
okay then
Nicholas scer then 18 okay we have
the everything okay customer name artist
name and the total spend this is the
customer Name the artist name and the
total amount this spend fine so now
let's move forward to the next
one which
is
okay okay yeah so the second one is this
we want to find out the most popular
music genre for each country we
determine the most popular genre as the
genre with the highest amount of
purchase so write a query that returns
each country along with the top genre
for countries with the maximum number of
purchases shared return all the genres
okay so what I will do first I will
write the
question okay so we
okay question
two so
find how the
most
popular music
music genre for
each
country okay with
determine
determine the
most
popular genre as the
genre with the
highest amount
of
purchase
okay then write a
query that
returns
each
country along with
the top genre
for
countries where the
maximum number of
purchase
okay
so so there are two parts in this
question first the most popular music
genre and the second is the need of data
at the country level okay so we can do
it from the two methods
okay using CT and the using the
recursive method so I will use the using
CT I will do this CT so for that you
have to write
with
popular
genre
as
select count
invoice
line
dot
quantity
okay
as purchases
comma customer
dot
country comma genra do
name comma genre dot genre
ID
okay
then here I will write row
underscore
number
number then I will write
over
Partition
by cust do
country order
by
count
voice
line.
quantity okay into descending
order as row number
okay so
from invoice
line
okay
yeah so here I will join the tables
join
invoice on
invoice
do invoice
ID equals
to
invoice
line do invoice
ID okay then again
join
customer
on customer. customer ID
do
ID underscore
ID equals to
invoice Dot customer
ID
fine then again we have to join
track
track on
track. track
ID equals
to invoice uncore
line
dot trackcore
ID
then
join
genre on joh
dot johra
ID okay
then track do John
Ry okay then I will do group
by Group by 2 comma 3 comma
4 then I will do order by
two then ascending
order and then one two descending
order
okay
okay then now I will write
select start
from
popular genre
where row
number is less
than greater than
one okay now let me run
it so now you can see we
have okay I will let me read it so we
have to find the most popular music jour
for each country okay so now we have the
country name Argentina the most popular
is alternative and punk John R is this
St number is
this okay purchase is this then the
Australia this rock rock rock rock rock
okay certain Rock us Rock and everything
is there right so this is how you can
find the most popular music genre for
each country okay the last question
question is still
here now the last question
is write a query that determines the
customer that has spent the
most on the music for each country write
a query that Returns the country along
with the top customer and how much they
spend okay for the countries where the
top amount of spent is
shared
right and they provide all the customer
who spend this amount
okay so for this uh this is like a
similar to this question okay so there
are two parts in this question find the
most spent on music for each country and
the second is the filter the data for
the respective customer it's very easy
okay
so okay I will write the solution okay
you can check the question from there
I'll write customer
with
country
as as uh I will here
select customer Dot customer
ID
comma first name
comma last
name comma
billing billing
country
comma
sum should be
total
as total spending right
then I will
write
row
number same over we have also written
here
now right the same we have to write here
over
then partition
by billing
country order
by by
sum
total descending
order as row
number okay
so after this I will
write here
from invoice you have to
fetch then again the same thing you have
to join the
table
join
customer
on customer
Dot customer
ID equals to
invoice do customer
ID okay then here I will write Group
by I 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma
okay that's
it okay then I will write here order by
four ASC ascending
order comma
5 to descending
order
fine so now I will write here
select start
from customer
with country
where
R
number is one
fine so let me run
it see we have first name last name
billing country total betting R number
and the customer ID let me show you the
question here write a query that
determines okay let me make it
okay
yeah so write a query that determines
the customer that has spent the most on
the music so customer we have the
customer name for each country write a
query that deter the country along with
this so we have the country name with
the top customer how much they spend we
have the total spending for the
countries where the top amount is shared
provide all the customer who
has customer who spend this amount okay
so we have everything
here right we have this Le from Brazil
this this this this is okay with the
customer so this is how you can solve
these questions so till now I can say
you have a good data analytics skills so
for this I can say this will help you in
the interview of data analyst in data
science or any SQL today we will learn
about the powerbi interview questions
and answers so powerbi is one of the
most trending bi tool in the business
industry today and most of the data
analysts are supposed to have a
comfortable understanding of powerbi bi
tool so if you are about to attend an
interview for a data analyst or a
powerbi developer a small set of PBI
interview questions and answers are
found to be the most frequently asked
questions so those important questions
will be dealt in this particular session
today before we get started if these are
the type of videos you'd like to watch
then hit that like And subscribe buttons
and the bell icon to get notified
firstly the first question is what are
the different types of filters in
powerbi reports so if you are an
experienced candidate or a beginner
these type of interview questions are
the ones which you're definitely going
to face so coming to the answer what are
the types of filters you'll be facing in
papia reports so there are three main
filters available in powerbi which are
visual level filters page level filters
and Report level filters which are
almost self-explanatory so if you want
to be someone who stands out out of the
group just mention a couple of more like
slices which can be also which can also
act some type of filters there right so
visual filters page filters and Report
level filters are the three main types
and if you want to add onto it you can
also add some slices right now let's
proceed to the next
question explain DXs in PBI so what
exactly is the meaning of tax and to
improvise your question uh or to
improvise your answer or if you want to
outperform you can also explain what
some of the explanations or
implementation of Dax in your nearest
examples like if you are working if
you're a beginner or if you're a fresher
if you're working on a portfolio then
you can give the example of your Dax
implementation on that portfolio or if
you're an experienced candidate just
explain your latest implementation of
Dax in your previous projects so the
answer for this question is Dax is
basically the full form for data
analysis expressions and is a Formula
language used in PBI cover pbit and SQL
Dax includes functions operations and
constants that can be used as a formula
expression to calculate and written one
or more values so that's just understand
it in this way right so if you are about
to perform an analysis or if you're
about to extract some insights for
example you own a super store right and
you wanted okay let's assume that you
own a Superstore and you have five
regions north south east west and
Central and you are U providing um
products from uh few categories let's
say it mobile phones desktops everything
and now you wanted to identify one zone
which is giving you highest sales in
Mobile phones and you wanted to identify
one zone which is giving you least sales
in um mobile phones in such scenarios
you can just write up a formula equals
to um mobile phone's product and M uh
you know products uh minus products
which are less than a number specific
number you you actually wanted to
identify products less than um 100 U
mobile phones right you just want to
know if there is any region which is uh
selling less than 100 mobile phones then
you can extract that so the expression
what you're writing there is nothing but
a Dax expression so apart from this
example you can also put up some complex
examples if you're an experienced
candidate or if you're a fresher then
you can come up with some Dax
Expressions that you buil on your
portfolio projects moving ahead we'll
discuss the third question how does CBI
integrate with other tools and services
so there might be a situation where you
might have to get connected to different
sources of data right so let's say you
wanted to import Excel data as well as
some service like a cloud service you
want to extract data from a cloud
service as well so how can you do that
and if you want to do that can you do it
right so that's the question so
basically this is a kind of question
which comes up from two different zones
can you integrate or can you connect to
two different sources of data or in case
if you can connect how to connect right
so it's it's like is it possible to
connect this is also a question to
beginners to test your knowledge on the
fundamental knowledge powerbi they want
to know if you can connect data from two
different zones it's not like two Excel
sheets they want to know from two
different platforms Al together let's
say I have data and Azure let's say I
have data and SQL so can I connect them
both yes you can do that so the answer
for this question is BBI offers
extensive integration capabilities with
various Microsoft products like Azure
Excel SQL and some third party Services
as well like a website any application
or
uh database SQL databases Excel
spreadsheets and other cloud services
like gcp AWS Etc so that's possible so
you just have to let's go for a
demonstration on this not a complete
demonstration let's cancel this so here
if you just it's it's just like a
overview how to connect so here if you
see we have Excel workbook semantic
models data flows data was SQL Server
web o data feed plan query and if your
uh source is falling different from
these available ones you can just click
on more and select any one of these
options right here correct so uh with
that let's get back to the next
question what are the differences
between PBI desktop and PBI service so
the terms are self-explanatory if you're
an experienced candidate then you can
Define the answer right away but if
you're a beginner especially if you're a
fresher then you must be a little
cautious here so if you are building
your portfolio if you are learning the
fundamentals of powerbi then you are
doing it using powerbi desktop right but
if you are a professional or an
experienced candidate then you are
developing the interactive dashboards
you are developing the interactive
charts and graphs and everything and you
are providing that visual only visual
only the dashboard to your end user who
is your client so in that scenario your
client will be given the powerbi service
module right so they will be having a
service access only just to watch the
visuals so the answer for this question
is powerbi desktop is a free application
so it's not completely uh free so there
are in situ there are uh situations
where you might have to deal with some
huge data or you have to deal with some
uh parameters like security everything
in those scenarios you might have to go
with the licensed version so for a
learning purpose it is free application
installed on a local system that lets
you connect to transform visualize
modularize your data and few more uh
implications that you can do and on the
other hand powerb service is a
cloud-based service that allows you to
share as discussed only to share and
collaborate on on uh and distribute your
power reports and uh dashboards with
others within your organization so
client is partially a part of your
organization because he has some
business to do with your organization so
basically understand it in this way
powerbi desktop is something which
allows you to build it will give you the
blocks you build the visualization and
then you give a screenshot or you give a
picture of that particular build to the
end user you can have visual on it how
it is performing it doesn't have to
worry about how it is working in the
background he doesn't have to worry
about how big or how um large is your
data set how it is extracting what API
is it using what's the he doesn't care
about it all he cares about is the
visual how is his business doing so in
that scenario you just want to give a
picture that's when you use the power
service now let's go with the next
question how do you handle Security in
bi so this is a question given to the
experienced candidates so you can think
about it about the access rowwise access
let's say you are the leadership team
and next is the manager next is the uh
individual contributor correct so here
the full access the full visuals of your
business how your business is going on
how are the leads how are the revenue
how is the the RPL house the traffic
everything is visible to the uh
leadership or the manager correct but
when it comes to the IC or individual
contributor who is just working on
traffic he will have access only to
traffic not the leads not the revenue
generated not the uh RPL and everything
because he has nothing to do with it and
that is something which you can't reveal
to an IC for data security purposes so
it you can also consider this in the way
of inheritance right so uh you can
divide it based on the level of the
employee right so level wise you can
provide the access to your employee to
your manager uh if you're a developer
let's say So based on the employee level
based on the manager level based on the
leadership team you can give separate
access to separate candidate so the
answer for this question is powerbi
provides Ro level security RS
which allows you to control access so
you're basically controlling the access
to the data for different users within
your organization you can Define rules
on the data set that filter the data
based on the user rule additionally
forbi integrates with Microsoft Azure
active directory to provide
authentication and
authorization now the sixth question
what is a Content pack and
powerbi content packs are type of
package that includes a related set of
dashboard report and data elements they
used to share insights reports and data
sets with colleagues and organization
within a broader audience powerbi also
offers organizational content packs
which allows you users to quickly
connect and analyze data from popular
business applications so basically
content pack you can imagine content
pack as a set of charts graphs or a
complete dashboard or data set elements
so when when you integrate all those
inside a bubble that particular bubble
can be considered as a Content flag now
moving ahead we have the seventh
question describe a scenario where you
improvised performance of a power B
report so let's say this is uh so
basically before we answer this question
this question is for an experienced
candidate not for an intermediate or not
for a beginner LEL right so if you are
someone who has three to four years of
experience that is when this kind of
questions are shooting so explain a
scenario where you improv the
performance of apia report so there are
certain
scenarios where let's say you're working
with a uh business data Amazon sales
data so you have uh Amazon sales data or
any other data for a beginner purpose
okay let's say some XYZ company so
you're working with XYZ company and you
have a sales data from a past couple of
years and your client asked you ke last
year this particular dashboard was
working fine but down the line when we
entered the new quarter or new an annual
year I can see there is some discrepancy
or I can see there is some delay for the
powerbi dashboard to load now there can
be multiple reasons for this the first
reason could be the hardware setup or uh
uh maybe the data is increasing day by
day so the hardware is not supporting so
that could be one reason and provided if
uh there are some visuals which are
already created visualizations or graphs
or dashboards and we are not most mostly
using them so those can be one of the
reasons so in these scenarios you can
just give some uh explanations which you
already faced in your current
Organization for example like you can
say uh the client is not willing to uh
scale up the hardware like the the
hardware which stores the data or
something like that is not ready to
scale up the hardware but he wants to
use the same Hardware but he wants you
to increase the speed in this scenarios
you can eliminate the data which is not
currently in use let's say you're using
2020 21 22 23 and 24 data now all you
focus on is the year on-ear growth so
you just need 2022 2023 and 2024 not 21
and 20 right you can erase that data
from your existing Hardware or servers
this will ease up the load on powerbi
and automatically there should be an
increase in speed another one if you
have already created some visualizations
which you're not currently using let's
say you already created two to three
dashboards and you rely on One dashboard
alone not the rest of those two you can
delete those visualizations so something
like that which can help you but to
consider the question as an assignment I
would like the viewers who are an
experienced data analyst to answer the
question in your way possible so that
the viewers can benefit from multiple
answers so you can write down few
scenarios where you face this problem
and how you sol it it can be a oneline
answer it can be a points which you can
mention right a set of points which you
can mention that helped you to improve
the performance of your PP end report so
the answer for this question which I
have is in one scenario I'm the
performance by optimizing data model
reducing the number of unnecessary
columns and rows in data sets and
dualizing summary tables to decrease the
data volume that needed to be processed
I also replaced complex calculations in
the report with simpler ones which uh
were possible and used direct query mode
for real-time data requirements to speed
up a report loading times so this can be
a good answer you can also add up some
answers from your end as well to benefit
the viewers now let's go with question
number eight explain the difference
between measure and a calculated field
so this can be an important question for
freshers especially right so me
personally I've asked this question to
the candidates many times so the answer
could be a little tricky right so most
oftenly the question can be asked as
what's the difference between measure
and a calculated column or measure and a
calculated field or measure
and dimension right so the answer should
be like this just pay attention to what
the answer you know interviewer is
asking you and answer wisely if he's
asking you the difference between
measure and dimension it's clear
self-explanatory so something like
measure is something which can be
measured the number is a measure let's
say the salary is a measure the average
of uh marks obtained is a measure marks
obtained in a specific subject is a
measure rate of interest is a measure
traffic is a measure right so when it
comes to Dimensions something like a
character data type maybe and name of
the store and let's say we didn't have
we had a various reion in the previous
question north south east west central
this particular data which cannot be
measured is called as a dimension now
for this question here what's the
difference between measure and a
calculated column So Cal calculated
column is something which you generate
out of a calculated field right whenever
you try let's say you have the quantity
and you have the price but you don't
know rate of each product correct in
such scenarios you can write up a
calculated field and build a new column
called rate of product that particular
column is a calculated column which is
newly generated after writing a
calculated field so the answer for this
question is calculated column creates a
new column based on existing data using
formula it adds to your new you know
it's add to your existing table as a new
column as we discussed measure creates a
dynamic calculation that summarizes your
data measures are used in visualizations
to analyze Trends or answer specific
questions now with this let's move on to
the next question describe the process
of publishing a powerbi report to
service now this can be an answer for
both I mean this can be a question for
both freshers as well as experienced so
uh now you can give it a try you can
give me the answer for this you can
write down your answers in the comment
section below and U everybody has their
own way of answering this question but
as simple as that let's keep it normal
now in powerb and desktop go to publish
and choose PBS service select the
workspace to publish and configure
settings like sharing access click
publish to upload your report of VI
cloud service so this is the answer
given by most of the experienced
candidates but when it comes to freshes
it's okay if you answer in this way
create multiple charts create multiple
graphs understand the requirement of the
end user build the require required
charts and graphs integrate all those
charts and graphs to the dashboard it's
also a good way to tell it but if you're
an experienced candidate or if you're a
beginner just try to include these
points as well just go take a step ahead
and go a step further and answer include
these points in your answer go to
publish select PBI service select
workspace right so these will enhance
your answer and make a stand out from
the other crowd now let's continue with
the 10th question how would you handle
missing data in powerbi so this can be
answered for both you know this can be
asked for both beginners as well as uh
experienced candidates so it's obvious
if you're a DAT data analyst it's
obvious that your data will not have
complete uh completely filled rows and
completely filled columns right there is
a possibility that you might have blank
rows there is a possibility that you
might have blank cells there is a
possibility that you might have
irrelevant data there is a possibility
where it can be a typing mistake and you
might insert special symbols in place of
numbers and special operators in place
of alphabets everything is possible so
in such scenarios how could you handle
right so there are multiple approaches
so let's say if you are going through
some uh column which you feel is not
mandatory to create your report you can
ignore those uh cells and you can just
delete it and uh in case of there is um
a discrepancy in your existing data and
you find that is important then you can
always have a way to go back to The
Source Who provided you the report or
Who provided you the data ask to
complete them as to give them them the
right number or in few scenarios you can
also if you don't want to eliminate any
kind of rows and columns you can also
have an option of taking an aggregate
value on it maybe the minimum value
maybe the maximum value may be an
average value in that particular missing
cell so there are multiple possibilities
and if you feel like adding those
answers you can also feel free to add
them so that everyone is benefited so uh
my kind of answer is there are several
ways to handle missing data filtering
where you can exclude simply that's the
first one you can just ignore those and
exclude those missing values replace
missing values with some aggregate
values custom logic create a tax formula
to address missing values based on
specific
scenarios now let's move ahead with the
next question how do you connect
multiple data sources to a Power report
so the answer is powerbi allows
connecting various data sources you can
directly import directly use live
connections or create comp composite
model to improve and combine data from
different sources so this is not just
the powerbi dashboard you're here I mean
it's not just the powerbi desktop you're
not just importing data it's related to
the real time dashboard report so if you
have a report and you are ought to
connect some external Source some
realtime streaming data you can do that
using some live connections and apis now
let's move with the next
question what are data Flows In powerbi
so the answer for this question is data
Flows In powerbi are cloud-based
preparation and management tools that
allows users to ingest transform
integrate and enrich Big Data from
various sources they are designed to
simplify data preparation and enable
scalable data integration and storage
across multiple powerbi projects now the
13th question how can you handle a data
up dates in propia so this is also one
of the simplest but also the trickiest
question let's say you already connect
let's say let's we are dealing with
Excel data and your client provided you
the Excel data and you already created a
dashboard out of it and out of your
knowledge you don't know right uh you
might not know what happened after they
share the data and the client gets to
know there there is some discrepancy
there is some irrelevant data or there
is some missing value in the data
provided to you and they add it and you
missed it correct in those scenarios how
can you handle data updates right you
can either refresh there are multiple
answers for that so let's go with the
answer so data updates in powerbi can be
handled through scheduled refreshes or
realtime streaming data sets schedule
refreshes so let's say you provide some
6 day or one week or one day based on
requirement you provide a scheduled
refresh and it will uh act upon it and
it will refresh its source every single
time it basically refreshes the
dashboard you created it will extract
the data from the source and it will um
create a new report out of it so
schedule refreshes can be configured in
powerbi service allowing data to be
updated at specified intervals realtime
streaming data sets can be used for
dashboard tiles that require continuous
updates now the 14th question on our
list can you explain the concept of a
slicer inbi right so those who already
are comfortable with the Excel they
might know the answer for this so it's
completely similar right so let's
discuss the answer a slicer is a powerbi
visualization used to filter the data
basically it's nothing different from
Filter right it's just an option like a
drop- down that you create in Excel
using the data validation that's the
same in pubi as well as Excel you just
have an slicer option where you can
provide your selection and it will give
you an ENT report so basically it's it's
a filter so it provides a way for users
to filter the data that is displayed in
other visualization on a report page
slicers offer a more interactive and
intuitive way to make selections and see
the data that changes dynamically as
selections are made let's say you have
class 10 class 9 Class 8 and you wanted
to just check the results of Class 8 you
just select the option of Class 8 on the
slio and you have the report so that's
how it basically works now the last
question for today's session what is
direct query in powerbi so the answer
for this question is direct query is a
connection type in powerbi that allows
you to directly connect to a supported
data source enabling realtime reporting
capabilities without importing or
copying data into powerbi while it
offers up to-date data it also limits
certain functionalities and might impact
Performance Based on the query load on
the source system so with that we have
finished the top 15 papia interview
questions and answers that are
frequently Asked in a data analyst
interview provided for both freshers as

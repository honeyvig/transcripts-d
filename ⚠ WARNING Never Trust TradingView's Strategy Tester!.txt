hey traders check this out here's a
script i wrote today it is a strategy
script very simple strategy all it does
is buy and sell daily breakouts so when
a new day begins
run the one hour time frame here the
script places a buy stop order three
pips above the previous day's high
with a five pip stop loss and a 10 pip
profit target and then the opposite for
shorts so we place a three pip sell
limit below the previous day's low with
a 5 pip stop and a 10 pip take profit
and using a fixed position size over the
past
773 trades we've had a 46
win rate with a 2 1 risk reward a only
three percent max drawdown
and a return
of 157
it's pretty awesome right
what if i told you
this script might not be profitable at
all
[Music]
i think it's time we talked about
the trading view strategy tester system
and its dangerous limitations this
lesson is going to be very important
especially if you're new to pinescript
so what's going on here and what do i
mean by this script might not be
profitable at all when it clearly is
looking at the data here and this is
just using a fixed position size we're
not even adjusting our risk per trade
based on a percentage of our account
balance we're just trading a mini lot
over 773 trades
what could be wrong about this system
look at all these winning trades we have
here
uh here's a winning trade here's a
winning trade here's a losing trade
here's a winning trade and another
winning trade
in fact there are hundreds of winning
trades here
but are they all really winning trades
let's have a quick look if i turn on my
drawing tool here you can see my
vertical line here
on this bar
right before this trade here
we're on the one hour time frame
and as i mentioned at the start of this
video this strategy is placing a buy
stop order three pips above the previous
day's high
in the strategy tester system
and you can see right here that the
strategy tester has counted this long
trade as a winning trade but you might
be alarmed to know
that this was not a winning trade at all
this was in fact a losing trade and i'll
show you what i mean so let's turn off
this script and drop down to a 15 minute
time frame and have a look at what
actually happened here so here is the
trading question let's zoom in a bit
here
make this a bit bigger
so
let's look at what happened here this
purple line is three pips above the
previous day's high
and then on this day you can see price
rallied
higher and higher
and then it filled us on our buy stop on
this wick here
but then either on this bar here the bar
that we entered on price retraced and
hit our stop loss we'd have to go down
to a five minute time frame to verify
whether or not this entry bar triggered
our stop loss but certainly the next bar
has a giant wick that went well below
our stop loss which means price actually
rallied filled us stopped us out and
then hit our one hour time frame profit
target
but we go back out to the one hour time
frame
unhide our script
and go back to this trade
you can see that the strategy tester
system has counted this
as a winning trade the problem here is
pretty obvious we have no idea how many
times or how frequently
this situation occurs
and over 773 trades
i'd say there's a good chance it
occurred quite a few times and i'm sure
that the actual results of this strategy
if we were to manually go back and back
test every setup accounting for that
lower time frame price action
the results of this strategy would be
far
far
worse than what the trading view tester
system is telling us
so what does this mean does it mean that
we cannot trust tradingview strategy
scripts
in a word yes it does mean that
but it's a little more complicated
not every script is going to behave this
way depending on how your script detects
entries and actually executes trades
that will affect uh how susceptible it
is to this intraday price action dilemma
now the back tester system
when dealing with historical bars does
not account for how price action
unfolded within that bar which is
extremely unfortunate and i wish that
the tester system did account for that
it would be great and it would make a
lot more sense if every historical bar
on our price chart was calculated using
tick data
so it would play out it would simulate
how that bar played out during that hour
that trading session and then it would
correctly stop us out on our entry
candle but unfortunately at least in its
current iteration or current state the
tester system does not account for intra
bar price action
that is a huge limitation of the
backtester system and something you need
to be aware of when you are testing
scripts through it basically you should
be extremely skeptical of the backtester
systems results on any script that you
run through it but especially scripts
like this one which use a
buy stop
and sell stop
price to enter
its positions
the reason that buy stops and sell stops
are particularly troublesome is for the
reason i just showed you here in that we
don't know how this bar this entry bar
played out
inside the bar so on a lower time frame
the tester system doesn't account for
that pullback after our order was filled
one way to mitigate this issue or make
it a little bit less of a problem in
your scripts is to make your strategy
scripts
only operate or make its trading
decisions based on candle closes
that is one way to
[Music]
prevent this from being as big of a
problem it can still be a problem if the
bar that hits your take profit also
tagged your stop loss it's impossible to
know which order that happened in it's
impossible to know if the intraday intra
bar price action came down and hit your
stop loss before it came up and hit your
profit target and the tester system
might record that as a winning trade
when in fact it was a losing trade but
at least if you're operating based on
candle closes that accounts for the
intra bar price action when you're using
buy stops and sell stops to enter your
trades it doesn't account for intra bar
price action which can be a big problem
over a large sample size of trades in
all of my videos in dealing with the
trading view strategy tester i always
encourage traders to manually back test
their systems anyway of their strategies
always manually back test your
strategies there is no way to shortcut
this process the only thing this trading
view strategy tester is useful for
is identifying
markets and
trading strategies that exhibit
potential to be profitable so just
because this trade here was actually
losing trade and was recorded as a
winning trade doesn't mean that that
happens frequently enough that this
entire
strategy is unprofitable it might be
profitable but i can guarantee you
that its drawdown and its win rate
are going to be significantly different
to what this tester system is telling us
it is so the purpose of today's video is
not to scare you off using the strategy
tester but to inform you on how it
actually works what its limitations are
and to warn you against trading strategy
scripts based on the tester results if
you were to go out and try to trade this
strategy
without manually back testing it first
to confirm
that it is in fact profitable
you're going to be in for a rude shock
when you realize that its drawdown is
much higher than three percent and its
win rate could be much lower than 46
percent anyway that's all i really
wanted to say today uh this video is
just like a public service announcement
of sorts
just to let you know
to be dubious of the tester system don't
depend on it don't go out and trade
scripts just because this thing says
it's profitable the strength of pine
script isn't its back testing
capabilities it's its tool creation
capabilities and the indicator this
indicator that we've created here could
make for a great back testing tool
but as a strategy
i just wouldn't i wouldn't use it i
wouldn't pay any attention to this
information whatsoever until i manually
back tested this
using an old-fashioned spreadsheet and
hours of hard work unless you're going
to commit to learning a language like
mql or python or something more advanced
than panscript
uh
don't depend on pinescript to replace
the role of manual hard work in your
trading process it's just not going to
happen it can dramatically speed up that
process
for example let me throw on a script
that i am working on currently
here is a script that i created that is
actually profitable i have gone back and
manually back tested this and it is
profitable but these numbers here are
not accurate uh the win rate was a
little bit lower the drawdown was a fair
bit higher nearly double and the net
profit was around the same i think if i
remember correctly
but this system this script operates on
candle closes
and the whole purpose of it isn't to
replace my back testing process but to
help me in that process help me speed it
up be more efficient you can see that
this script actually draws my stop loss
size and my take profit size directly
onto the chart
which helps me
back test markets significantly quicker
than if i had to manually
add on the atr indicator and measure
from the
closing price to the low and add the atr
onto that number to get my stop loss
forget about it i'm never going back to
doing that manually ever again even
though i wouldn't depend on the strategy
tester system
um it's not a waste of time
this script does help me identify
markets that are more profitable than
other markets for example eurocad here
is not very profitable at all and i
haven't manually back tested this yet
but i assume that if i did my results
would not be profitable either but on
some of these markets
this strategy does show potential
and so to summarize
i'm not making this video to scare you
off the back tester system just to
inform you not to trust it completely
make sure to do your own research do
your own homework and just use the
tester system to help you identify
markets that might be profitable so that
you can prioritize them in your manual
back testing process and save yourself
time
from testing all of these markets one by
one you might give up testing a strategy
that is profitable because it wasn't
profitable on the first five markets you
spent weeks back testing using this
backtester system this strategy tester
you can identify markets that might show
potential
on certain strategies and then you can
confirm that potential by going through
the process
of manually back testing entering that
data into a spreadsheet to get a more
accurate sense of its total gain and max
drawdown and its
win rate wherever that is here let me
change that to percent so a 43 win rate
with a two to one risk reward is still
profitable but this isn't what my script
was telling me my script said that it
had a 50 win rate with a much higher
return but this strategy was still
profitable on this market at least in
theory even your manual back testing
doesn't account for things like slippage
spread commission costs missed trades
that you couldn't take for whatever
reason you've all seen the disclaimers
historical performance is not indicative
of future performance that's true for
automated back testing results as much
as it is for manual back testing results
but in saying that
historical performance is the only
indication we have of whether an
approach to trading has worked in the
past
and the only way to truly confirm that
the strategy you want to trade is
profitable is to forward test it with a
small account balance a small amount of
risk a lot of traders recommend demo
trading a strategy
if you're an experienced trader i
wouldn't bother with demo trading
because it doesn't account for
commission costs it doesn't account for
real market conditions if you're a
beginner trader of course demo trading
is important so that you can learn your
platform learn how to trade
and learn the process of trading but if
you're an experienced trader who is
profitable or at least isn't blowing
accounts and you know what trading
really is about uh then
forward testing on a real money account
with a few hundred dollars is the only
way to truly confirm if a strategy it
can be traded profitably
just because it's profitable in theory
doesn't mean it will be in practice so
that's it for today's lesson if you want
to learn more about strategy scripts or
how to build trading tools to assist in
your back testing process and your live
trading process so that you never miss
trades
you can automatically generate alerts
for trading setups that you trade so if
you already have a profitable strategy
coding it in pinescript is one of the
best things you can do because even
though it might not be able to back test
for you
it can help you trade more efficiently
it can help you test more efficiently
and it can help you to never miss a
trade ever again so if you'd like to
learn more about pine or you want to
steal the source code every script i've
ever written including a few profitable
strategy scripts that i've manually back
tested to confirm that they are indeed
profitable head over to
pinescriptmastery.com
where you can find all of my courses on
pinescript including a free basics
course if you're new to this and you
just want to dip your feed in and just
sort of test the waters a bit and see if
this is something you'd be interested in
anyway that's it for today thanks for
watching good luck with your trading
take care and beware of the trading view
strategy tester don't trust it don't
trust anyone or anything in trading
always manually back test do your own
research do your own forward testing
uh do your own work no one can do your
homework for you it pays off in the long
run it is hard work but it's worth it
see in the next video
goodbye yes

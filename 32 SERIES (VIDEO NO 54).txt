hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss some important
points regarding physiology of
respiratory system point number one the
oxygen tension of the mixed venous blood
is 40 mm of head g number two the
transport of carbon monoxide is
diffusion limited because it binds a
wiggly with hemoglobin number three
inability of exchange of oxygen through
lung tissue is known as it's too toxic
hypoxia number four carotid body
function in an organ works as
differential pressure of oxygen in
arterial blood number five the exchange
of gases between plasma and tissue fluid
is a function of partial pressures
number six circulatory shock is an
example of stagnant hypoxia point number
seven oxyhemoglobin saturation does not
depend upon the skin color number eight
hypoxia causes the oxygenation of
hemoglobin and increases Bantry tyrosine
phosphorylation and thereby stimulating
like Allah sees by releasing the
glycolytic enzymes from Bantry on the
RBC membrane number nine partial
pressure is the individual pressure
exerted independently by a particular
gas within a mixture of gases number 10
partial pressure gradient is the
difference in the partial pressure of a
gas between two regions that promote the
moment of gas from high partial pressure
to the region of lower partial pressure
for in number 11 the presence of carbon
dioxide decreases the affinity of
hemoglobin for oxygen and enhances
release of oxygen to the tissues
shifting the oxygen dissociation curve
to the right this is known as Bohr
effect whereas the combination of more
amount of oxygen with hemoglobin
displaces carbon oxide from hemoglobin
the excess of oxygen concentration
results in shift of carbon dioxide
dissociation curve to the right this is
known as Halden effect number 13
pulmonary ventilation is equal to tidal
volume into respiratory rate whereas
alveolar ventilation is equal to tidal
volume minus dead space to the
trade rivet for number 15 primary
inspiratory muscles are there from an
external intercostals muscle number 16
accessory inspiratory mezuzah steno
mastered Scalini an anterior serratus
number 17 primary expla tree muscle is
internal intercostal is muscle
number 18 accessory experiments are
abdominal muscles
number 19 anemia and carbon monoxide
poisoning causes anemic hypoxia in which
the oxygen content of blood is reduced
as the amount of hemoglobin combining
with oxygen is reduced number 20 cyanide
poisoning results in history oxic
hypoxia in this partial oxygen is normal
but the tissue does not utilize the
oxygen as the poisonous substance
destroys this cytochrome oxidase system
number 21 perfusion means the rate of
blood flow to the tissues blood flow to
the effects of lung is less
so inflation perfusion ratio is man's
moment the effects whereas blood flow to
the lower part of lung is maximum so
ventilation perfusion ratio is minimum
number 22 the ability of lung center
acts to expand is called compliance
number 23 work of breathing
it is the work done by the respiratory
muscles during breathing to overcome the
resistance in the tracks under spray
treat act number 24 a duei resistance is
the resistance offered to the passage of
aid through respiratory tract it is
directly proportional to the work of
breathing
number 25 elastic resistance of lungs
and thorax
in is indirectly proportional to the
work of breathing number 26 the partial
pressures of oxygen in mixed venous
blood is 40 mm of mercury and arterial
blood is 95 mm of mercury number 27 the
oxygen content of arterial blood is 90
ml person whereas the oxygen content of
venous blood is 14% number 28 the non
elastic viscous resistance is the energy
required to overcome the viscosity of
lung tissues and tissues of thoracic
organ number 29 hypercapnia is the
retention of carbon
sit in the body it causes respiratory
acidosis and decreases the pH of blood
as the plasma bicarbonate may exceed 40
maq per liter number 30 pulmonary
circulation constitutes the entire
output of right ventricle it consists of
mixed venous blood and undergoes gaseous
exchange with alveolar air number 31
bronchial circulation forms the minor
part of blood supply to lungs and
constitute a very small part of output
of the left ventricle this is important
in the air conditioning of inspired aid
number 32 lungs play an important role
in sodium balance through
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
that's it for today's video guys keep on
revising all the best thank you

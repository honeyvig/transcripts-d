hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss 32 important points
regarding temporomandibular joint and
maxillary sinus point number one in
articular discs posterior band is the
thickest band of all number two
components of future temporal mandibular
joint become evident at ten weeks of
intrauterine life
number three slit-like intervening discs
of TMJ becomes evident at 12 weeks
number four maxillary sinus reaches 60%
of its adult size by nine years
number five eight nine years shape of my
slurry sinus is avoided number six order
of teeth which are in close proximity
with my slurry sinus ease maxillary
first molar night slurry second molar
second premolar maxillary first
premolars and mites larrikin i'm number
seven in extraction of maxillary first
molar palatal duties most commonly
involved in the formation of oral
fistula number eight symptoms of fresh
oral fistula
includes five is they are escape of
fluid epistaxis escape of eighth
enhanced column of faith and
excruciating pain
number nine symptoms of established oral
fistula includes five piece they are
pain persistent post nasal drip purulent
fowl unilateral nozzle discharge
possible sequel a of general systemic
toxemia condition and popping out of
antal number 10 in
temporomandibular joint proprioceptive
information is caused by the masseteric
and auricular temporal nerves
number eleven muscle attached to
coronoid is temporalis muscle number 12
volume of missouri sinus is fifteen
milliliters
number thirteen medullary sinus
grinds into the middle meatus number
fourteen interdependency of osteoblasts
and osteoclasts in bone remodeling is
called as coupling number fifteen the
walls of the maxillary sinus are related
to floor of the orbit they are per
posterior teeth and the infra temporal
fossa number sixteen reversal lines of
alveolar bone indicates these cessation
of osteoclast ik activity number
seventeen pH of saliva is six point
seven to seven point four number eating
pH of parotid saliva is six to seven
point eight number nineteen salivary
glands are merocrine glands number 20
camels glands are minor salivary glands
in retromolar region number 21
Puran found in saliva is adenosine
number 22 Sol sensation is produced by
ionizing substances number 23 the
membrane of the axon and secretory cells
are separated by a space of ten to
twenty nanometers number 24 the largest
major salivary gland receives blood
supply from external carotid artery
number 25 primordial parotid gland
appear at four to six weeks of unit I
train life submandibular gland appears
at sixth week of entire train life and
sublingual gland appear says eight to 12
weeks of intrauterine life
number 26 the almond-shaped put salivary
gland that is sublingual gland receives
no supply from facial nerve or seventh
cranial nerve number twenty-seven
cytokeratins
present in supra base layers of musketry
mucosa odd ck1 and secretin number
twenty-eight
cytokeratins presenting supra basal
layers of lining mucosa are 3 K 4 and 13
number 29 cytokeratins present in
ventral surface of tonga CK 5 6 and 14
number 30
cytokeratins present in soft palate are
Sika 7 8 and 18 number 31 the junctions
that allows electrical and chemical
communication in oral mucosa our gap
junctions number 32 cornified cell
envelope is former by cross-linking of
in the Ukraine and Laughlin that's it
for today's 32 series guys all the
points discussed here are very very very
important from neat and aims point of
view so you reverse them well thank you

>> On today's Visual Studio Toolbox,
April joins us to give us an overview
of the Power Platform and we
start to explore how Visual Studio
developers can join the fun.
[MUSIC].
Hi, welcome to Visual
Studio Toolbox.
I'm your host, Robert Green.
On today's episode, we're
going to start our look at
the Power Platform and
April Dunnam is going
to join us. Hi, April.
>> Hey, Robert.
>> How are you?
>> Pretty good happy to be here.
>> Happy to have you.
This is the first in
a three-part mini series
on the Power Platform,
which I think a lot of
people have heard about it,
certainly seen about it,
heard about it, maybe watched
the keynote demo or so.
But I keep hearing these
phrases like no code and
citizen developer and
easy and .NET developer,
Visual Studio guy, my
first slide as well.
This is no code.
What role do I play?
The answer is there is a role for
Visual Studio and.NET developers
in the Power Platform.
I think it's a very important
one and what we want to do on
this series is direct this
at .NET developers and
explain to them what
the Power Platform is and
where they can fit in.
We're going to do that
in these three episodes.
Episode 1, today will
just be an overview
of the Power Platform with April.
Next week, Greg Hurlman will be
on to do a more of a
deep dive and show
how to build apps that include
Web APIs that are written
by .NET developers.
Then in our third and final episode,
we're going to do a one hour live
show where we actually build
a Web API that is then consumed
in Power Platform apps.
I think you guys,
people watching this, just watch
these and really understand,
I don't think we're necessarily
breaking any new ground,
but we're approaching this
from the .NET developer
inside instead of the
business side building app.
Same content, just a
different spin on it.
Hopefully at the end of the three
episodes, you guys will say,
"Yeah, that's something
I definitely want to
do and now I know
how to get started."
That's the goal and
with that you're up.
>> Awesome. Thanks for having me,
this is something I'm super
passionate about as a .NET Dev and
SharePoint dev myself that
got into Power Platform.
We sharing a story of
how, like you said,
we often hear of Power Platform
talked in terms of being
no code, low code.
Where do we as Pro Devs and
done a dev student to this?
Actually I'm going to share a screen
here on the slide deck that I
have that shows a really good
visual of this whole story,
the holistic story of the Power
Platform and what it has to offer.
Just setting the stage here.
When we talk about
the Power Platform,
if you haven't really
dug into it a lot,
we have four main products
that we can use that are
part of the Power Platform.
There's Power BI that
you might have heard
for your dashboards and reporting.
We have Power Automate,
which is the glue where we can
do some workflow automation,
even robotic process automation.
Power Virtual Agents is one
of the newest features of
Power Platform for building
low code chatbots,
and then Power Apps,
probably one you might
have heard talked about
a lot in some capacity
with new traditional
developers because
that allows us to build
low code applications.
Those are the components
of the Power Platform,
but what really makes it
powerful is the fact that yes,
it can tackle those no code and
low code scenarios for
citizen developers,
but there's a great code-first
pro dev integration story
with extensibility points that
we can leverage for this.
It's all about really
increasing your efficiency as
a developer and letting you focus on
what you actually want to focus on.
You don't have to worry
about the UI, for example.
You can focus on building
that .NET API or whatever that
you're trying to build in
the backend and all that and
let citizen developers handle
some of that frontend stuff and
tackle these things together.
>> You get to own the data
logic, the business logic,
the data layer, and not have to
do these boxes and grids anymore?
>> Exactly. It's all about making
your life better and easier and let
you focus on what you
really care about.
Really what this ties into is
the whole concept, the
fusion development.
You might have heard us talk
about that a lot here lately.
It's nothing that's really new.
Fusion development teams
have been around a while.
I think, what's the stat there?
About 84 percent of companies
have some fusion
development team in them.
It's really all about IT Pros,
devs and low code
developers and some guys,
whatever you want to call them,
working together to
create software faster.
There's something in
this truly for everyone.
You can have those low code devs
that know the business
process and the solution,
what they're trying
to solve really well.
Get in there, be able to determine
the requirements and what's
actually needed in the software
that you needed to build and even do
a prototype of the UI and
how you want it to look.
All you have to do as a developer
is help bridge the gap in
some of the planning and security
and being able to pull in data,
for example, say from internal
systems APIs that you
might have in facilitate that
extension and integration.
It really makes the process
very user-friendly,
collaborative and helps everyone
focused on what they actually care.
>> Cool.
>> Yeah. Those are the metric,
they're about 84 percent of companies
do have these fusion teams,
like I said, so many benefits
of embracing this fusion
development approach.
An example of how this
could work in action.
I really want to focus here
on Power Apps because that's
the application
development standpoint
used for the Power Platform.
You are the ability
for an end user to be
able to come forward
with these requirements
that you want to solve,
having a citizen developer build
that frontend in a Power App.
Then if you need, like I
said, to integrate data
from one of your legacy
or on internal systems,
being able to go
plug-in as a pro-dev,
add in that functionality,
and be able to have
this seamless process.
How we do that plugin is with
something that Power Platform
offers called custom connectors.
Custom connectors, a connector
is something the Power
Platform that they have,
which is just a wrapper
around an API that lets us
communicate between services
in the Power Platform.
It's one of the things
that really makes
building applications on
the Power Platform so easy,
because we have about 500
different built-in connectors
that we can just plug
and play right now.
These are services like
Microsoft Services,
as you might expect,
SharePoint and all that.
But other services like
third party SaaS services like
Box and Salesforce and all that.
We even have the ability with
the connector model to plug
into on-prem data with
an on-prem gateway
and to be able to
develop and register
your own custom connectors
to build building blocks
for citizen developers.
If you have an API,
maybe you want to be able to extend
a legacy application
that you have in
its infinitive backlog
forever to add
some additional functionality
or screens to it.
What if you could just expose
that API and custom
connector and let
your Citizen Devs consume that
information and build out
a simple three-screen Power
App to connect to that data?
Saves you a bunch of time,
all you have to do is just make
an API that you already have
built probably available and you
can do so much more with it.
>> If I have a simple Web API that
talks to SQL Azure for example,
would I connect that to
the Power App or would I
just let the Power App talk
directly to SQL Azure?
>> You can technically do both.
That's one of those 500 connectors
that the Power Platform offers
as a connector to Azure SQL.
You could do that, but if it's
any other RESTful API
that you have that
maybe doesn't have talk with SQL,
maybe it's stored somewhere else,
whatever it might be
and you want to be
able to interface with that API,
you can just register it as
a custom connector to
your service to be able to
have that building block.
The cool thing about that is
you build this connector once,
and you can use that same
connector in a Logic App,
which is what Power Automate
is actually built on top of,
Power Apps, and Power Automate.
You can use it for
workflows scenarios,
Logic App scenarios, and application
scenarios, and Power Apps.
>> Can I hook it into Power BI?
Is Power BI considered a Power App?
>> Yeah. You can have Power
Apps embedded in Power BI.
I buy the way that design,
we could integrate
that all in there.
What's going on behind the
scenes with the connector model
just to level set that is you
have the connector itself,
which is really what knows
your Web API and
the operations and that
host details and all that,
but when a user goes to
use your connector inside,
say of a workflow in Power Automate
or an application of Power Apps,
they create a connection
to your connectors.
That's why it has the
actual credentials and
the reference information
to the connector and
facilitates that communication
to your Web API.
>> Okay.
>> With custom connectors,
a few different ways
that we can create these and I
know you'll be getting into this in
some of the future
sessions in more detail,
but we have a built-in
wizard-like experience,
but we can also import directly
from OpenAPI definition.
Either a file or
directly from a URL.
It's really pretty easy
and seamless to create one
of these custom connectors if
you're already using OpenAPI.
>> Then if I already have
my Web API sitting up in
an Azure service is there
a preview connect
directly to that service?
>> Yes. That goes into the integration
with Azure API Management.
There's a native connector
and integration with that.
If you're using that,
you can just connect
directly and it will
export a connector
for you from Azure API
Management hosted APIs.
>> Cool.
>> I thought that we show
briefly just how easy it works.
You have an API.
I'm here on the Power Apps portal.
If I'm a user and I want
to be able to use this,
all I did is I went into
Custom Connectors as the
developer of the API,
and I registered a new connector.
I've went to New Custom Connector,
I saved from an open API file
that I already have exported.
It takes you through
this process here.
It gets all that information down,
and you can specify a
name for your connector,
description, the scheme,
and all of that.
Then here on the definition,
this is all of the
actions for the API.
It automatically
import that for you.
If you need to override anything,
we can do that here
from this portal.
We can even have built-in testing,
before we try to use
this inside of an application
to make sure it works.
We can do a simple
test as the operation,
and it will return since it'll have
an accept header, it's
probably going to come back,
for example, with maybe
an error message here.
Let me know what happened,
and if it worked or not so I can
do that built-in validation.
Now, that's all I need
to do as a Pro Dev
or a citizen dev who wants to
come in and use this in an app.
I have this app here.
I'm just going to open
this in edit mode.
You'll see how easy it is
to integrate the connector
as an end-user inside of an
application you're trying
to build to extend it.
This is an application for Farm
Plant Inventory Management,
it's really the purpose of this.
The API that we have interfaces with
our database to retrieve
information about different plants.
If I want to use this, I just
have to go up to the data source,
and do a search for that
API, that custom connector.
Add that in with one click,
as you can see, we already
have that API in there.
Then now if I want
to go into search,
all I'll I do is on this button,
I'm going to have that call my API.
I'm going to pass it in
what I want to search for.
That's going to return
the results for me.
I just had to do this very simple
Excel-like formula as an end-user.
Now it's returning data as
respecting all the
security and everything,
that we put in place with their API,
so we don't have to
worry about that.
Now I'll just unlock all
these possibilities to be
able to search for something there.
It's just really pretty seamless.
>> Wow. Now you could obviously
build this app as a .NET app,
whether it's a Web App,
or WinForms, or WPF,
or WinUI, or Xamarin,
or Blazer or blah, blah, blah.
You've got the same Web API that
you would use for each of those.
Here you just register that API.
Pip create a connector
for it, and then,
your low code/citizen developers
come in and make
this app themselves,
or if you wanted to you could
build it yourself
more traditional way.
>> Exactly. You have
the flexibility there,
or yes you can build it
the traditional way,
but by being able to have this as
a connector available as well,
you're just giving even
more ways that we can
accomplish the same goal and
more integrations possible.
>> If I was still in
charge of building the UI,
when will I choose to
build it as a Power App
versus just a regular
UI that I'm used to,
is one easier than the other?
Obviously, if I build it
entirely from scratch you can
do everything I can code,
but for relatively
straightforward apps,
what's the sweet spot?
>> Obviously, this is going
to be super user-friendly.
Power Apps, as you're seeing,
I like to describe it as a
PowerPoint and Excel had a baby,
because the interface is very
PowerPoint-esque, I mean,
you're drag and
dropping your controls,
and here for what you need is very
seamless the formulas
are Excel-like.
It's going to be really
quick to build this.
The other thing that you
want to keep in mind is,
I built this Power App right now
and you notice that it's
running on my desktop.
The same app would run
seamlessly on my mobile
device or my tablet.
I build one application once.
I don't have to worry about
targeting it for iOS and
Android and the desktop
and all of that.
I just build one user experience,
and it works accordingly.
That saves a lot of time.
The other thing that you need to
point out about Power Apps is,
this is a Canvas application.
The intention of this
being to be used within
the firewall within your
Microsoft 365 Tenants.
Decision point where you might
just go, the custom route,
the traditional way would
be if it needs to be
anonymous or external
or something like that.
But for those enterprise or just
a specific application needs,
Power Apps is pretty hard to
be in a sweet spot
because it's just so
fast to build and to get
something up and running.
>> If I wanted to build one
that my wife and I would use,
I could do that and
we've got 365 family.
Is that the equivalent of a tenant
that we can use Power Apps in?
>> The family doesn't
but what you can do
is use the Power
Apps developer plan.
That's a new plan there,
and we can test and build
all the Power Apps,
that we want their
most in 365 plans like
the Business Premium and all
the eight skews and all that,
include a license for Power Apps.
We actually have that
myself, my husband and I,
and I built an application
of Power Apps to
do manage when he needs to do
the lawn and when he needs
to water and all that stuff.
We have actually did
that with Power Apps.
>> Cool.
>> There are other
integration points
to that, I thought I'd point out.
That's a big one, especially for
.NET developers is being able to
consume your APIs in
there and saving time.
But there's a lot of
other extension points
that I don't want to point out.
Let me just pull something
up here real quick,
because this is a great slide here.
Sorry for all the back-and-forth.
There you go.
This shows the whole scope.
Besides Custom Connectors,
what else can we do from
a product standpoint
with a Power Platform,
specifically, Power Apps.
With Power Apps we can even
integrates with things like IoT Edge.
It has built in mixed reality,
which is pretty cool.
This is one of the things
I did at Hackathon.
It has a 3D viewer mixed reality
control where you can place
objects in mixed reality and even
measure and do things like that.
We can have geospatial mapping,
even integrate with the HoloLens,
the applications that
we build in Power Apps,
again without having
to worry about a lot
of heavy code just very quick use.
Artificial intelligence. This is
another good integration point
from a product standpoint.
Now, the Power Platform has
some built-in lightweight
AI capability
with some pre-built models.
There's going to be
some extension points
where that might not cut it,
you might need to do something
even more customs to being able to
integrate with Azure
Cognitive Services easily,
and robotic process automation,
in even GitHub and Power
Apps Portals API Management.
There's just so many
possibilities to be able
to extend what we can
natively do with the no code,
low code by integrating some
professional development skills.
The other great thing
that I always like to
bring up and we're
talking about this, "Man,
this is just like another thing
I have to learn that if I want
to start integrating or
working with this."
Well, it's really
not because the way
that the framework works or
how everything works here is,
is you can leverage the
existing tools that you
already know and just plug and
play into the Power Platform.
That stuff I was showing
with the custom connectors.
I really didn't need to do anything.
I had to go, export it.
It's even easier if
you're exporting from
Azure API Management. I
didn't have to do much there.
I just used the existing tools I
have to create and host my API.
But another extension
point that we can do
is something called
Power Apps components.
When we're looking at that screen,
you notice that we had a
few built-in controls.
Well, we have the ability to inject
some product like
TypeScript in HTML and CSS,
JavaScript, all of that, to be
able to create custom controls.
If we need like a custom
map widget or whatever
might be that's not natively
there in Power Apps,
we can use TypeScript
like we are using and be
able to build that and
integrate that within our apps.
There's built-in integrations
with Visual Studio Code.
We just released a VS Code extension
for the Power Platform
to help you be able to
manage your source code
for those Canvas Apps
and manage from administration
side and all that.
There's tools that you're
already familiar with we
can use to integrate with that,
and the command line tooling,
and all of that's built in.
One thing I did want to point out is
the underlying data
structure like how this
works because Power
Platform is a platform and
it sets on something
called dataverse.
That's more than just
a database that we can
use to store data in
the Power Platform.
It's really facilitates all kinds
of things we've been able to do
some standard data operations
and transactional book stuff.
That's where the assets
that you create are stored.
As Power Apps that you store,
whether you use dataverse as
a database to hold that or
not, are stored in there.
We have built-in APIs
to be able to consume
information and do
automated deployments
and things like that
with a dataverse.
It's even more powerful when
you're integrating within that.
Dataverse itself, the thing
I always like to point
out for the Pro Dev
audiences that it
actually runs on Azure
and extends with Azure.
It has built-in integrations.
You're able to extend it with
Azure functions Event Hubs,
service bus Kubernetes,
and it has support
with data flows for
all different types
of data to be able to
pull data into dataverse.
We can handle relational
data like SQL,
non-relational data like
Cosmos and all that.
It really is pretty robust and
supports a lot of extensions.
>> Right on. It tends to
be probably a good place
to stop for Episode 1.
It's been a great intro and I
think people should at
this point hopefully be
itching to learn more.
Again, we'll come back next
week and see how you actually
build some apps using the
things that you just showed us.
In the meantime, where
can people go to learn
more just to get involved with this?
>> We recently, a team here
on the Cloud obviously did
a fusion development learning
path on Microsoft Learn.
If you go to aka.ms/learn-fusiondev,
that's a really great
path walking you
through the fusion
development approach,
how you can integrate custom
connectors and all that.
>> Right on. Thanks
so much for this.
I know we could talk
for hours on this,
but I think 20 minutes that
was a really good overview.
Thanks so much. Next week,
we will start diving in.
Then a couple weeks after that
we'll get really hardcore.
Thanks so much, April.
>> Yeah, I think it was fun.
>> Hope you guys enjoyed
that and we will see you
next time on Visual Studio Toolbox.

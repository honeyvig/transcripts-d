tell the team and individual involved in
the software development how to build
software just like a set of instruction
helps the team make sure they do
everything right a software development
methodology provides a roadmap for a
building software products it outlines
the steps involved in the software
development process from planning and
designing to testing and deployment a
software development methodology is like
a set of best practices that help team

high quality software through
incremental development collaboration
and continuous feedback whereas devops
aims to streamline software development
and deployment process enhance
collaboration and Achieve faster time to
Market next let us see the focus of
agile and devops agile focuses on
effective project management closer
customer collaboration and delivering
working software in short iteration
devops focuses on automated eating

delivery infrastructure as code and
improving communication and
collaboration between teams next let us
look at the agile and devops tools first
the popular agile tools widely used in

platforms monitoring and logging and
many more and next let's have a look at
the benefits of agile and devops agile
enables faster response to change
improved customer satisfaction and early
and frequent delivery of working
software whereas devops facilitates
faster software delivery improved
quality through automating and testing
increased efficiency and better
alignment between development and
operation teams and next let's have a
look at some of the popular career
opportunities in agile and devops so in

United States is around 175 000 annually
in India it is 9 lakh per annum the
average salary for a devops engineer in

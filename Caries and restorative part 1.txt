I'm back here now I'm going to discuss
about the carries and restate a part of
the pediatric child in this discussion
so first of all we need to make a note
about the factors that are controlling
the dental caries soaky's has given
there are three main factors which are
controlling dental caries into a triad
that is called as key stride which
includes bacteria that is dental plaque
died that is the food basically
carbohydrates and the host that is the
tooth okay so these are the three main
factors which controls the dental caries
according to the keys later a fourth
factor was added in which this triad was
converted into that rod the fourth
factor is the time okay this cat rod is
called as new burnstead rod okay so it
carries triad which is three factor now
it's converted into fourth factor the
fourth factor is the time then comes a
concept that is called as carry around
okay so karyogram concept was given by
brothel in the year 1999 okay and they
have integrated this into your software
which is called as integrated sorry
interactive karyogram program in which
he has given that carries is controlled
by five factors yes
divided the pie diagram into five
sectors like each factor denoted by a
color coding and controls one factor so
that is green color green color green is
nothing but chances to avoid dental
cares so green is something good next
one is dark blue easy to remember D and
D so dark blue is basically concerned
with the dye t means the content of died
and the frequency of died that we take
the next comes is the red red is the
danger red is something like a bacteria
the amount of plaque or the the quality
and quantity of plaque
organisms that are present in the plant
basically they have an effect on the
occurrence of tentacles the next goes is
the light blue sector light blue sector
is nothing but systemic it is based upon
the combination of the preventive
measurements that we take that is the
fluoride program or saliva increase in
saliva secretion or improving the
buffering capacity of saliva the next
comes is the fifth factor that is ildo
factor those are circumstances
circumstances are a combination of past
caries experience and related diseases
okay
so these are the five factors which are
controlling the dental caries according
to the brothel in his carrier so they
can give a karyogram based like coding
different colors this is different
colors in green or light blue dark blue
red and yellow
so basing upon which the outcome of
caries can be predicted so this is a
five factorial so initially they have
started at three factors that is caries
triad followed by the fourth factor that
is added that is the time that is caries
cataract and now karyogram is their
karyogram is a five factor one initially
Keira gram has started as a three factor
now it is converted into five factors so
so now we have five factors but due to
modifications in the lifestyle or the
food habits or many other things now if
a question is asked like caries basing
upon the Charis Charis now is considered
as a multifactorial carries now is a
multifactorial multi factor means
depends upon many factors like it depend
not only not only like the host or the
bacteria or the or other other other
aspects it depends upon multi factor
means it depends upon many other factors
for example life stephannie lifestyle of
an individual has they're all on
tentacles okay the socioeconomic status
of an individual has a role or dental
care is the education status of an
individual has a role and understand
have a role on dental caries because an
educated person can understand the value
of prevention or value of maintenance or
value of heisting so almost every factor
indirectly or directly
the role on dental care is now if a
question is asked like Carrie says means
the answer should be multifactorial
according to the recent trends
okay the next important aspect is the
most common area that is primary window
and second rib interpret window period
is something like like an opening of a
window
so whenever window is open you have more
chances of occurrence of an infection so
these window periods are there for
almost all the diseases means the ACE
where the disease more occurrence is
called as a window period of a
particular disease similarly caries is a
by model okay it has two window valid
Sonny's primary window period simple Li
you can remember primary window period
occurs at the eruption of primary and
secondary window prett occurs at the
eruption of second radiate that is
called as permanent it so primary window
period mostly occurs in the duration of
7 to 31 months and I hope you know that
the first is the direction to the water
carrot is six months so it's going to
take one more month for the bacteria to
accumulate on the teeth and cause the
dental caries so it is 7 to 31 months
and secondary window period occurs at
any is of 6 to 12 years so all these two
important these two numbers are very
very important what is primary period
what is second repaired by 7 to 31
months is called as primary perturbing
goes primary tea perhaps
and the second repair it is 6 to 12 es
that is the permanent develops the next
comes is ok I hope you're very clear
with this this is again an important
question you're finally here that is the
initial care is what is wide spot lesion
is a question so white spot lesion is
also called as an initial caries or
insufficient caries okay which is most
commonly seen on the smooth surface of
that teeth visible as a white spot and
the point to be noted the important
point to be noted here is it has intact
surface in the surface on the teeth is
in that so it has intact
surface okay and below this intact
surface there is subsurface
demineralization okay so below that
intact surface you have sub surface
demineralization you'll have subsurface
diamond early chase so what is the
treatment of this white spot elation the
treatment of this white spot lesion is
remineralization it's not it's not
restorative treatment it is
revitalization don't ever restore or
remove a white spot relation and restore
with the composite okay right spot
lesion is intact surface with subsurface
demineralization so what is the
treatment as it is diamond relized you
need to remineralize it so i play some
remineralizing agents over that area so
the remineralization is going to start
and the white spot illusion is going to
disappear so that is about this initial
carries lesion or a wide spot lesion
okay
so we'll learn few important concepts
related to the white spot lesion
okay so white spot lesion is I mean how
you need to how you will appreciate a
white spot is not as simple II how you
will appreciate a normal thing in the
environment okay it's because of the
refractive index difference between two
mediums we are able to appreciate a
thing for example if you keep water
inside water can you can you can you can
I differentiate water inside water no we
cannot differentiate why we are not able
to differentiate because water inside a
water both of these waters will have
same refractive index so when the
refractive index is same you cannot
differentiate them for example if you
keep a bowl of water with a dye and a
normal water inside a big big pot you
can differentiate because of the color
difference the color difference is
basically the change in the refractive
index so because a blue color will have
a different refractive index this means
a blue color water will have a different
refractive index one compared to the
white colored water so you are able to
differentiate so this is a logic that is
followed by The Magicians in most of the
magic shows okay they use two different
materials separately and the
bind the material and you cannot
differentiate them why you cannot
differentiate them is the simple logic
is they select the different materials
which has same refractive index for
example if you drop a police piece of
glass glass inside of water inside of
water most of the times you cannot
differentiate the glass from the water
because glass and water will have close
refractive index values so when the
refractive index values is different
between two substances you can clearly
appreciate them when they are very close
you cannot differentiate them so that is
a logic in identifying the white spot
lesion if you see the refractive index
of a the refractive index of air is one
here is one and the refractive index of
water is one point three three and the
refractive index of hydroxyapatite
hydroxyapatite is nothing but a
structure that is the tooth okay your
tooth refractive index is one point six
six
so the refractive index difference
between the tooth and the water is more
when compared with the refractive index
between the water and the tooth that is
less so the simple logic is you can
easily identify a lesion with a
different contrast media that is means a
lesion can be easily identified if air
is a media but if it is a water because
water and the tooth has close refractive
index for example when there is starting
of demineralization saudi malaysian
process starts the refractive index
drops may it may hit somewhere around
1.4 or 1.5 for example so 1.5 1.4 and
1.33 the refractive index difference is
very very less means a white spot lesion
cannot be appreciated when water is a
media added to it for example if you
take a white spot lesion and apply water
on it to the white spot lesion is going
to DIF is going to disappear because the
refractive index is almost the same okay
so and the same goes like the white spot
region can you clearly appreciate it now
when you dry the teeth so that's the
reason why when you are appreciating the
white spot lesion you have to dry the
teeth okay and this is the basic
difference between a white spot lesion
population whereas your enamel
hypoplasia will not disappear when you
apply water on it when I have elevated
there as a white spot lesion when you
wet it it's going to disappear because
the water is going to occupy the porous
space as you know that the water and the
and then the demineralized structure has
almost the same refractive index you
cannot appreciate means it's just
masking it's something like a magic so
whenever you're right the teeth white
spot lesion disappears and whenever
animal hyperplasia will not disappear so
and the second important thing as the as
the team utilization level is not up to
a level which can be appreciated on the
radiograph these things cannot be
diagnosed radiographically okay you
cannot appreciate a white spot relation
on radiograph now the only mode of
diagnosing it is by a naked eye or by
using a dye ignore tenth ok we'll learn
what is diagnose and in further further
slides ok so die ignorant is a mode by
which you can appreciate a white spot
lesion or initial animal kills ok there
is one more thing that you have to make
a note apart from the regular dental
care is what we learn in operative
dentistry that is linear enamel Kharis
okay that is linear and Amal caries so
linear enamel caries is also called as
or don't ecclesia okay which is most
commonly seen at the neonatal line of
maxillary anterior these are most
frequently asked question you can
clearly see and appreciate on the on
this clinical pic okay you can see a
neonatal line okay this is most commonly
seen in maxillary anteriors the reason
is the neonatal line okay so this is
basically due to the metabolic defects
or metabolic change during the pre birth
and post birth because it's most
published in the neonatal line and those
metabolic changes can be due to change
in the calcium level that is that is
available for the baby or it may be due
to trauma during the birth and these
areas are more prone for occurrence of
caries that is dental caries okay so
okay points to be done is the other name
okay most common area is neonatal line
of Mack
very anterior and the reason is the
metabolic defects of the metabolic
change between the pre and post I hope
you are very clear with us the next
comes is the pH okay so the regular pH
off your saliva is seven seven okay the
range is six point eight to seven point
two simple so whenever you take food
whenever you take food and the bacteria
acts on this foot particularly the food
is the carboy it let's when the battery
acts on this foot the bacteria is going
to say great lactic acid so whenever an
acid is secreted it is going to affect
the pH of saliva means water now when I
got a pH of saliva seven when an acid is
added the pH is going to drop down to
seven below seven okay so it is going to
hit six sometimes it's going to hit five
okay so there is something called as
critical pH of animal that is five point
two to five point four so whenever the
pH of saliva hits the critical pH of
enamel the animal cannot bear and start
demineralizing okay so whenever this
hits six and comes to five point two or
below that the animals start losing it
ions that is called as demonization when
it occurs when you have sugars that is
corporate it's funny how bad we are the
critical pH is going to hit and the
enamel is going to start demineralizing
similarly the enamel is going to take
the ions from the saliva also when the
things are favorable when that is called
as remineralization loss will be again
mineralized BAC that is remineralization
when it is going to happen when you have
a good prevention measurements like
Florida or good secretion of saliva many
how good secretion of saliva this pH is
going to get neutralized and the pH is
going to back to seven so that is called
as remineralization so a process of
remineralisation demineralization cycle
occurs which moves around the critical
page that is five point two to five
point four
so what is the advantage of adding a
florid very simple when you add fluoride
to the tip the teeth regularly contains
hydroxyapatite okay when you add
fluoride to it it is going to convert
into fluoro hydroxyapatite fluoro
hydroxy apatite flora hydroxyapatite or
floor apatite
so when compared with the normal
critical page normal critical pH is five
point two to five point four that is
hydroxylate when you add fluoride flora
hydroxyapatite enamel will have a
critical pH of four point two to four
point four means whenever the critical
page is going to hit four point two to
four point four then only the flora
hydroxyapatite is going to occur a
process called assimilation until then
it will not hit so that is the advantage
of adding a fluoride so that is the
critical pH the critical pH things which
moves around okay you can see this the
critical pH of normal and I am L is five
point two to five point five whereas the
critical pH of flora hydroxyapatite is
is it's around like four that is four
point two to four point five it is five
point two to five point five above below
there is a process of remineralization
and demineralization cycle okay so we'll
learn few important aspects related to
the florets there is something called as
fluoride bump or fluoride syndrome okay
something called as fluoride bomb or
fluoride syndrome few people they call
it as hidden kills when it's going to
occur hidden caries there is a Keres
because of fluoride the process of
remineralization occur okay the process
of remineralization occur and there is
remineralisation only to the for example
if you take this is a crown and this is
the case how care is here but the
fluoride content has increased and the
upper part
has undergone three metallization so
lost but the lower you're not able to
reach your florid levels are not able to
reach the lower half and there is
something called as he didn't get us
which is not seen which is buried okay
that is chlorine fluoride syndrome or
florid caries you can call it as awkward
caries also okay which can be seen on
radiograph but cannot be seen clinically
because there is an intact animal okay
so already learned that the device that
is used to identify the white spot
lesion is die ignorant okay so this is a
picture of die ignorant which is given
in aims once okay they have given
identify this diagram or they can ask
you to identify the wavelength of light
that is used in this diagram or the
principle that is used in diagram of the
scientist that is concerned with or or
the range of numbers they can give you
the number here and they can ask you the
that diagnosis so all we are going to
learn so this diagram diagram is very
very important so coming to this
diagnosis was given by Lucy at all
okay so Lucy Etta and what they have
used they have used a new laser
fluorescence system in this okay they
have named it as die ignorant which
helps in diagnosing or identifying the
dental cares the numbers varies from
book to book but basically you can make
a note okay a few people they say it is
from 0 to 99 and in in your shop at and
then it is from minus 9 to 99 if you
have minus 9 to 99 in the options go for
it if not you can go for the second-best
option that is 0 to 99 the range is 0 to
99 or minus 9 to 99 minus 9 is minus 9
reading is that tooth with the highest
value okay truth with the highest value
so these are the Rangers okay so these
are the Rangers if the value is from
five to twenty five then you can call it
as initial carries lesion okay if it is
greater than that particular range then
it is called as early dental caries okay
if it is greater than 35 okay if it is
greater than thirty feather then it is
called as advanced dental caries okay so
these are the ranges and the more most
reason that is Keo has given these
ranges okay that is 0 to 13 is called as
no caries 14 to 20 is enamel caries but
the treatment they can give they can ask
you they can just give you the number
they can ask you what is the what is the
treatment here it is prevention care is
advised 21 to 30 that is dental caries
or prevention or operator care basing
upon the wrist when it is the value is
more than 30 then you can go for an
operator to care okay so they can give
me simply okay this particular device
have a has a reading score when I played
on a carries lesion the value is 45 what
is the treatment procedure that you are
going you have to go for a cavity
restoration you have to remove the
caries by an operative procedure when
invasive procedure and then you have to
fill it with some composite or gic
so basing upon which they can ask some
questions related to the numbers also so
there is one more device called as mini
D carries something looks like a pen
okay when it when I keep the pen you
will have a reading reading here reading
or with a with a color coding okay so
basing upon that they can ask you a
question this was question that is given
in one of the recent examinations of
need so a color coding of green color is
something like a safe job an orange
color is a limitation of the safe zone
means your approach you're approaching
okay and a red color is is going to be
the danger of penetrating through the
dentin layer
so this mini D carries has this
principle of identifying which type of
carries it is and the same color coding
is also applicable for few a rotors okay
for a few air orders like if you use a
rotors right
so these aerators will have a color
coding which is going to give the
approximation of the pulp oh okay like
for example if it is approaching Tenten
it will have a different color coding if
it is approaching the pulp it's going to
give a right red color signal that yeah
we are approaching the pulp don't go
very deep you may have a pump explosion
the same color coding the same
methodology is being approached that is
basically because of the difference in
the temperature the temperature change
when you approach the palaver that will
be different so because of the
thermostat there will be variation in
the in the color coordinate system okay
so I'll be posting one more video based
basing upon the classifications that
that are that will be noted like apart
from GV black classification there are
many other classifications that are very
very important in examination point you
feel which will be uploaded further in
the next part of this carries and rest
at a part of periodic change
thank you all signing off from TM MDS

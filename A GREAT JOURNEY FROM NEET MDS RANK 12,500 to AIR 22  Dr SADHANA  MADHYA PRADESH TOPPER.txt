yeah
so hi everyone this is dr saiti team mds
conquer
so here we have our all india rank 22 dr
sadhna
so she's from madhya pradesh and
probably she's the best rank in her
state
okay so today we are going to have an
interview with her of how did she start
and how did she cope up and how was she
throughout the preparation till the date
she achieved her rank of all india 22.
yes hi sadna once first of all heartless
congratulations for your rank
so i think you are the probably the best
ranking from your state
so exactly when did you think of
starting your preparation
first of all thank you so much mom
i started in june 2021
okay and then it um it gave me 11 months
for to get prepared for this may exam
actually the exam postponement helped a
lot to me this was positive for me okay
that was an advantage for you
so when you started uh
by that time actually you must be
lagging behind few
most of the students then how did you
cope up that
oh i tried my best i was reading
i i gave a lot of my time to studies i
used to talk to the stressor and all the
mentors
i tried and things which i
missed in the first round i tried to
focus more on that in the next round of
revision okay so in a day how many hours
you used to allocate for the studies
itself
um because
i started late so from the beginning
only i started with 10 to 12 hours only
and then i made the persistence of 14
hours okay throughout my preparation
in between i had many um breakthroughs
but i tried to make up yeah
so how did you like
because you have started late as you
said so did you compare with anyone else
or
or did you just compare with yourself
mom i knew because i have started late
i'd be a bit uh i i'll be lagging a bit
then
during initial mocks also i was lagging
which was conducted in october november
but then
i spoke to strata he also said that
he'll be able to do he motivated me
then i'll try it
so always like you used to compete with
yourself and then you have to you used
to improve yes okay so
that's a good thing so you can't always
compare with anyone else you have to
compare with yourself like how were you
before and how are you doing now and how
you want to do in future
that is the very good
uh like advantage of being a student
because if you start comparing with
someone else again you end up with
confusion because everyone's you can't
judge unless and until you step into
their shoes so you have to be in your
shoes and compare and then you have to
improvise accordingly that's a good
thing that you have done so one more
question i want to just actually it's on
behalf of many of the students so how
did you plan your day like when you
start your day how did you plan like
when you wake up in the morning like
what was the first thing that you used
to do and how do you used to plan your
day with that team
mum because she sir used to keep a
checklist of a complete subject um
before only so
a day before only before sleeping i
planned my day next day so i used to
wake up early in the morning i start i
always start with smart video to get
through the concept and to get what
should be read
i first see the smart video i'll make
the notes i used to make the notes and
then i also used to read my previous
notes which were made by me during my
undergraduate okay then i used to
solve the pulse and the synopsis
pulse was the next step for me first was
smart videos very good
so how far you feel the textbook reading
either the complete or a partial
whatever you think
is useful during the preparation because
there are almost 20 odd subjects where
reading all the standard textbooks may
not be possible because having that time
constraint it may not be possible always
so what is your suggestion because it's
on behalf of the students i'm asking
because many students they have an
instinct that they have to read the
textbook they have to read they have to
make line to line notes how far you feel
it could be useful because as you have
achieved it
so you will be a better person to tell
that
mom it's definitely not possible to read
the textbook it is not possible only
topics because we have already read
things in our undergraduate so i used to
know which are the topics i have read
from textbook it will be easier for me
if i'll read i'll go through those pages
so i'll choose those subjects or those
topics to read from book only the topics
only few pages not the entire syllabus
or the subject
it's not possible
yes so
how far like in your whatever college
you are from so the concepts that you
have gained then
and the concepts that you have gained in
this one year versus the four years did
you make out any difference in that
concept that you have learned yes
definitely ma'am
remember apart from anat and biochem
other medical subjects
we were not so
to the point concepts were not to the
point
pharmac general medicine
even the general surgery not so sure
with envious conquer i learned a lot i i
followed your lectures of father that
helped me a lot farmack definitely that
helped me a lot yeah how about the
dental subjects because dental subjects
also we just read the important
questions because we have to clear eight
subjects at one shot so what we do is we
read important questions we don't give
much importance to you know surgical
aspects or much of the depth so
how
could you cope with those eight subjects
also with them from that also helped
with the smart videos and the group
discussions whatsapp group discussions
were very very important for me because
the day used to be very monotonous
reading reading continuous reading
so i i used to wait for that one hour
when it will start i used to check my
phone again again for the messages at 5
pm 6 pm 7 pm or today's list
yeah okay so as a repeater because you
are not an intern and you took little
break and then you have started so how
could you cope up with that stress
levels
it was a really difficult moment for you
i i would suggest that nobody should
leave in between
because i lacked one and a half year
approximately i lagged one and a half
years so it was difficult to sit
for um
so many hours with books we have to
train our mind for some time few days it
went like that
even the smart video making notes just
half an hour smart video took me two
hours to listen and write the notes
later on i can get the speed the time
gets saved
but initially it was it was very
difficult to maintain that
consistency
yeah so actually uh our team that the
online platform that we have i think
that has really helped you out because
you stay a lot
miles away from where we are but did you
think that we are really so far away
from you no ma'am
because when it when it we talk about
the kilometers because you stay so far
we are in south you are in up north
there so
was that communication gap was there did
you feel being an online being
completely in an online platform
did you have that gap did you feel like
that
i think this is the best part of mds
conquer i would say this is the best
part that i never had a communication or
interaction issue with the mentors i
used to message and i know pakka i will
get the message i will get the reply
i'll wait for one or two day even if it
is missed i will get the reply i know
this i had because i experienced it this
with one month or two months that i will
get the reply i never had that
interaction issue even we can speak at
phone also call i used to talk to sir i
was in touch i used to
send the questions and the mentors
always you always have reply to my
doubts
that's great to know
so yes uh
like throughout this phase of
preparation you must be having some up
and downs also so ups anyways yes
you cope up like you'll be happy when
you have an up when you have a downfall
did any sort of motivation from the team
helped you
yes ma'am mum before exam not this
before the previous date uh just one one
month before i was some i missed some 15
15 days i didn't read 15 days i was so
depressed i felt like i have lost 15
days now i will not be able to
compete
so i spoke to sarsa told me that
you have 400 hours
you should not think like that
so
i used to mark each and every word of
srisa
i used to write at my wallpaper
okay so
uh
what about solving so many many mcqs
like you were you restricted or wherever
you got mcqs you used to solve apart
from the website website mcqs we make
sure that you do we are always ask you
to do but other books except other than
the pulse did you try to dig out some
other books or were you restricted to
one book mum only pulse and website
questions only okay so website you
solved all the papers all the mocks how
far the mocks were useful for you mocks
were extremely useful ma'am attempting
mock was a first step for me but
revision of this mock was more important
so that helped me to revise the syllabus
i revised my syllabus through mocks only
i used to read the question i used to
read the synopsis
if i am getting stuck at any topic i
know inside that i don't know i don't
remember this classification i need to
remember this i need to learn this again
so i'll go to that my notes and i'll
read it again
that's great mocks helped me a lot even
the subject specific tests though they
also helped me a lot
revising the subject
great so these marks uh how many like
did you revise like twice or thrice or
you just did the mock and you left it
no ma'am i revised my marks at least
twice
some of them i did thrice but twice for
sure
so how many times like you revise the
entire syllabus actually you started a
bit late as you said so you were
completely with the schedule or you
tried to step here and there
initially it was difficult for me to
cope up because i
i felt that i am a slow reader it's
taking more time for me to read and
finish one topic in a day
but later i could get
i can i i had three revisions i had
three complete revisions of pulse also
okay great
so when you revise pulse again did you
again solve all the mcqs or you just
went where you felt you were lagging or
where you are weak you exactly went like
that
my mind used to mark the questions which
i didn't knew in the first round in the
second round if i had time if the
subject is minor i will solve all the
questions like the idea is the memory
based subject by chem i'll do all and
i'll do all but uh clinical subjects if
i know the concept i will not solve all
questions i i i used to only solve those
questions which i have marked earlier
so this is going to add to a smart work
okay so hard work yes she did do that
but yes where to again emphasize and way
too again she has
nicely organized and she had did she did
that so because
again investing where we are already
strong it will waste your time and will
waste your hard work so this pinch of
smart work has landed her here
yes so last but not the least what
suggestions you want to give to the
upcoming juniors so being the part of a
conqueror now the mds conquer you have
achieved a good rank with that team so
you know many people here so what exact
suggestions you want to give
throughout the phase from the start till
the end what you want to give it to them
first of all i'll suggest to join mds
conquer
if not at least the honest perseverance
is very important extremely important
because
we know where we are we know our
knowledge
we know what subjects we are good at and
not good so we should work on those
topics
we should read those things we
like mom like i was very weak at memory
based things
it got it used to get vanished very
easily from my mind so i know i have to
revise um pharmac again and again
so i used to do that so i'll suggest
everybody to
at least
first of all they should start earlier
everybody should start earlier nobody
should take the gap
then how did you find this integrated
approach here because we have integrated
few medical subjects we have indicated
dental with the basic dental subjects
you found it to be useful very useful
mom
especially for ortho and pido it helped
me a lot and all the medical subjects
also
uh it was difficult like sir has planned
like 11 days for these four medical
subjects so it was difficult but if we
start with one topic one topic will be
thorough at least that one topic two
topics
yes yes mom so
in the first round i was not able to
finish in the complete thing then in the
next round i focused only on those
chapters
but it really helped starting with
physio then medicine
it it goes along
hand in hand so it it works very
smoothly okay so you went with the flow
and you were on track
that's great so the last days of your
preparation you know the last one month
or the 15 days
so did you have that butterfly feeling
you know some rats running around your
stomach so how did you cope up that
mom i was very anxious i'm a kind of a
rangers person but during this
preparation phase
i learned this also to overcome not only
studies i have
grown up as a person also to overcome
this stress yes
because the basic thing starts from now
because as we grow
the necessities will grow the
requirements will grow so obviously
stressful growth so how to cope up you
have learned from here that's a good
thing to know i'm all the weakness like
uh during my ug i don't used to learn
the definitions even i lose one or two
mark i'll be okay okay i'll lose but i
will not learn i will not sit and learn
this
but here i learned the classifications i
overcome my weakness
it's really great to know
yes doctor sadna it was really nice
talking to you i
i'll be happy if the juniors follow your
suggestions and
they will also be
achieving their success in your future
so once again it was really nice talking
to you thank you

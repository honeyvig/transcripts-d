right I shared my screen yes you do have
a chair give me one second okay all
right everybody we are live now we got
Holly on here talking about the ABP f--
framework open source so let's let's
take it away hey leo
oh there you go okay hi everybody today
I will introduce an open-source project
the ABP framework probably some of you
have already heard about it or using it
in your applications in any way I
believe that this talk will be usable to
understand the need for such a project
and what ABP is offering with its next
version I am a Libra whom Kalkan a
Software Architect and co-founder of
palo soft i am the lead developer behind
the ABP framework ABP is an open source
web application framework for the latest
asp.net Corie 3.0 ABP provides a
complete architecture and the strong
infrastructure to create modern web
applications it follows best practices
and conventions to provide a solid
development experience first we should
understand why we need to such a project
and why we have created it if you are
building your applications on top of the
plain asp.net core you mostly find you
on repeating yourself to build a similar
infrastructure again and again you need
to decide on an architecture say a
layered architecture based on domain
driven design or clean architecture
principles you will write some action
filters or interceptors to automate
cross-cutting concerns like
authorization validation exception
handling database transaction management
audit logging caching and so on you
definitely don't want to repeat these
logics in every source method you need
to create base classes abstractions
integrations extension methods how
purrs library workers to simplify your
application code you will deal with all
this infrastructure and much more stuff
again and again for every project for
that reason big enterprises are building
their internal application frameworks on
top of asp.net core but it's hard to
build maintain and document it this is
why most of such works finally failed or
no one knows how it works because of the
missing documentation beside the big
enterprises most of the software
development companies don't have such
development resources to build the
infrastructure themselves we have
created the ABP framework to address
this problem and provide a full stick
application model and infrastructure for
everyone it's hard and time-consuming to
select the right tools and we'll the
clean architecture while starting a new
application as a Software Architect you
need to close the followed software
trends tools principles and patterns you
have to believe the fundamental solution
structure and train your team to align
them to follow the same principles and
coding styles to create a consistent
source code when you use a VP
fundamentals of the architecture will be
already decided and implemented for you
a VP solution model is based on the
domain driven design principles and
patterns DDD offers four fundamental
layers domain application presentation
and infrastructure a VP startup
templates implement this layering by
providing a multi project solution
structure a b.p framework provides
infrastructure for your application to
implement TDD easier and finally a VP
documentation supports you to truly
implement TDD in your source code a
beefy framework is designed to create
fully modular applications it provides
infrastructure to distribute your
entity's services api's UI components
and page
into isolated modules in the development
time and bring them together to act as a
single application on runtime we already
created tribute modules like account
management Identity Management and
talent management those are ready ready
to use in your application documentation
and guides help you in building your own
modules micro-service is another
training approach to create scalable
systems both in development time and on
run time NIV ABP has been designed at
micro services in mind it provides
infrastructure to implement common micro
service communication patterns easily
it's integrated to the island server for
for authentication pre-built application
modules are designed so that they can be
deployed to separate servers or
containers with date they're dedicated
databases as independent micro services
we have also created a complete micro
service solution sample and documented
it to be a reference model you can check
it on the website multi-tenancy is a
fundamental architecture to create
software as a service solutions
ABP framework and modules provide a
complete multi-tenant infrastructure
tenon determination automatic data is
relation dynamic database selection
channel pays the setting system and much
more are already implemented by the
framework it not only supports to
develop multi-tenant applications but
also makes your codebase mostly unaware
of to multi-tenancy pre-built tenant
management module provides the
application logic and basic UI to manage
and create your tenants ABP framework is
not a new project actually it's the
successor of the asp.net boilerplate
framework asp.net boilerplate has been
around for six years
it has been more than 7,000 stars on
github
1.5 million downloads on new yet it has
been actively used by tens of thousands
of developers around the world we have
been working on the next generation of
the asp.net boilerplate framework for a
few years and it's finally here the
first stable version will be released in
a few weeks
based on the asp.net core 3 it's a
complete rewrite so we don't use the log
name anymore
it's the ABP framework and the new
website is ABP dot io it's now more
modular and micro-service compatible
supports relational and on relational
databases provides more options to
create composable and distributed
systems in addition to simple monolithic
web applications we are very excited to
introduce it in the same event Microsoft
launches asp.net Court 3 now I want to
show you how to create a new project
based on the ABP framework and make it
running in a few seconds first I'm
entering the ABP our website in the
getting started page we have two options
to create a new project via a BP
command-line interface
CLI or we can directly download from the
website once we enter a project name
then we can select application template
or module template to create a reusable
module I select the application template
we have two options as the UI framework
for now MVC and angular and we have now
two database providers and two framework
or supports most of the relational
databases at MongoDB and now we can
create a new project but in this demo I
will create the project via CLI
ABP new project name its grace the
complete solution in a few seconds
yeah the solution has been created I am
opening in the visual studio I have a
preview one it has a mom it is a multi
project solution consists of the source
code and related unit tests it's layered
based on domain living patterns and
principles and layers it's also well
documented on the website so you can
easily understand how solution structure
is design it when I run the application
the solution template has is include
some of the pre-built modules like
tenant management and identity
management when I run the solution yeah
I see the account module I can enter the
user name and password at the startup
time place uses two modules as I said
before identity management is used to
create and manage roles then we can set
permissions for each role that means we
can allow to do something in the system
for the human role also in the user side
we can set rules for the for a user we
can create a new user
it also supports multi-tenancy
out-of-the-box we can create tunnels and
use multi-tenancy as well it's localized
to a few language
okay that's all
the solution is stuff actually doesn't
contain any user interface component or
any functionality I have shown it uses
nougat package for all the functionality
related identity management talent
management account login and register
page okay let's continue now I want to
highlight some features of the ABP
framework as a brief the main goal of
the AVP framework is to make you focus
on your own bussiness code by handling
repeating tasks by conventions
it handles cross-cutting concerns and
provide services you need let's see a
typical application service class to
understand how ABP can help you in this
very simple code block AVP provides base
classes for ddd elements in this example
class inherits from the application
service application service base class
provides properties and methods commonly
used in the application layer AVP
automatically registered this class to
dependency injection container as a
transient service you can use the
generic repositories to work with the
database declaration authorizing tribute
can be used to check permissions which
are auto policies actually it is
completely integrated into asp.net
course authorization system and extends
it unit org system automatically creates
and managed database connection and
transaction for you
it rollbacks if your metal drops and
exception otherwise it saves all changes
to the database as a single transaction
it works out of the box by convention it
automatically validates the input and
throws exception if it is invalid so you
can safely work with the palette in put
inside your method it automatically
creates and saves
audit logs for each method call so you
can then get add attack
tailored report to know which user
called which method audit log system is
very detailed detailed and configurable
it can also save entity and property
changes as well
you never handle exceptions manually ABP
handles all exceptions and send an
appropriate result to the client ABP
extant asp.net calls localization
systems to make it more dynamic and
extensible object mapper is used to make
objects it has Auto mapper integration
out-of-the-box and can be replaced by
another mapper AVP also provides some
other services usable in the application
source in this way you only write the
code related to your business without
repeating yourself if your application
service basically performs quadruped
operations then you can also inherit
from the root of service to get it fully
implemented for you you can then
override and customize any method you
need once you create an application
service you type collie want to expose
it as an HTTP API by writing an API
controller AVP can automatically create
API controllers by convention based on
your method names input and output types
so most of the times you don't need to
manually create API controllers arrange
routes and HTTP methods okay you have
created your HTTP API and or let the ABI
a VP framework dynamically create it for
you what about when you want to use the
API from a client application AVP can
dynamically create JavaScript and C
sharp proxies you can use the client
proxies to use the remote HTTP API just
like calling a regular method in the
client side you don't deal with
authentication exception handling JSON
serialization deserialization and point
configuration and so on notice that it
doesn't generate any code it all handles
in the run time you don't have a large
machine generated code that you don't
understand what it does here to example
code that uses the dynamic client
proxies JavaScript code calls the method
just like calling a JavaScript function
c-sharp client injects the application
service interface which is shared with
the server the injected service is a
dynamic proxy object which internally
performs HTTP calls to the remote server
then you can use any service method just
like calling a local local method and
you get the result if provided ABP
provides a distributed event pots
out-of-the-box publishing and even is
pretty easy just injected I distributed
even post service and use the publish
method subscribing and consuming an
event is also easy just implement our
distributed even hunter interface and
fill in the handle even method the rest
of the communication and retry
mechanisms are handled by the ABP
framework it's integrated to RabbitMQ as
a first implementation we will add more
options in the feature a BP is framework
UI framework agnostic you can use
different UI frameworks like asp.net MVC
angular react whooshes or blazer it
currently has a missing and angular
startup templates more will become by
time in the section I will show some of
the ABP features for a missile age razor
face UI option in a modular application
you typically want to em and make your
UI components like wheels or javascript
file CSS files and image into the LS or
may get packets you may want to create
application independent reusable modules
with their own entities services API and
UI elements
ABP provides a virtual file system that
acts as a single file system but
internally can read contacts from
various resources like physical files
embedded files or even from dynamic
files created created on runtime this is
an essential feature when you want to
work with files distributed into modules
we have created tackle programmers for
most of the bootstrap for components
like buttons models cards tops and so on
in the sample you see a button and the
model the dialogue code writing using a
BB tag helpers it produces native
bootstrap code on runtime in this way
you write less code to create bootstrap
components in your views it makes
possible to get the power of the
intellisense when you want to directly
work with the bootstrap code you are
free to write native with dropped HTML
which is cooperates nicely with the AVP
toc helpers in addition to wrappers to
bootstrap talk helpers we taught that
creating a regular form requires a lot
of boilerplate code to reduce the code
we type we have created a VP input tag
helper which generates most repeated
localized and validated input controls
it understands the input type and can
work with the existing attributes to
customize the HTML output time we
thought why we should define an a VP
input tag for each form element when we
want to create a simple form what if we
create a single tag helper that gets the
model and generates the complete form
for us
ABP dynamic form tag helper does exactly
this creates a complete form for you
with a single line of code it gets all
the information from your view model
class handles validation and
localization to
the last feature I want to highlight in
this top is the bundling and
minification system provided by the ABP
framework you may think that why we need
to create another bonding and
unification system while we have a
speed-up net course bundle and minifiers
or gulp or grunt GS the main reason is
that none of them are modular none of
them can read CSS files inside the dll
none of them can this arc the bundle
content on the fly and actually none of
them are easy use which bundling and
minification system can be simpler than
this code it's just a tack helper
directly used in your page or view it
adds given files individually to the
page in development time bundles and
minifides
on runtime it works with the virtual
file system out of the box so you can
add an embedded or dynamic resource into
your bundle it can automatically include
dependencies to the bundle that means if
you included the library to the bundle
that depends on jQuery it automatically
includes jQuery to the bundle if jQuery
was not already added to the current
page before that means it rearranged
bundles on-the-fly
can't determine the bundle content
conditionally it allows you to create
named bundles and reuse it in an
application or even across multiple
applications it has many more features
that are needed to create modular web
applications check you can check its
documentation so I highlighted some AVP
features that are easy to explain in
such a short talk then there are me many
built-in features and extensibility
points waiting for you to disk or visit
a BPO and follow tutorials to learn it
deeply as the last word
ABP doesn't try to reinvent the well
instead it tries to fill the gap between
the plain asp.net core and real-world
enterprise application the
not scenarios it helps you to code in
best practices to build maintainable
software solutions okay that's all for
my talk if you have any questions I'm
glad to answer them
yeah somebody was that's a great great
story the Helena somebody was asking
Ritesh um Tamara carcasses are they any
real use of a BP at the moment yes
actually a BP is the next generation of
the asp.net boilerplate framework so
it's widely used by thousands of
developers for the ABP IO the next
generation it's in the preview know we
have just upgraded to asp.net code 3
yesterday
immediately upgrade nicest asp.net core
so we are using it in production but we
don't call it 1.0 for now because it has
some locking documentation and we we
want to test more so some of the custom
some of the developers are using the NIV
a BPO in their production and one but we
don't such as for a few weeks more a few
weeks more Dom we will release the first
stable version for the BPO awesome
awesome yeah people been saying great
presentation there's a comment here from
Oz Bob Western Australia I've been
reading a VP documentation all did a
support slash buckle integration and
open API and swagger UI Wow definitely
gonna give it a go so yeah your you did
a great job for sending all the features
of your framework that's awesome so I
want to thank you for taking the time
talking about it and showcasing it I
know everybody were excited so we're
gonna hang up here folks and we're gonna
get Martin who's gonna talk about
indexing nougat with a sure functions so
again Ellie oh thank you so much
thank you very much and thank you to
everybody listening me okay
oh so much have a good one I will be
back in a bit folks

for several decades the model view
controller mvc design pattern has been
extensively used across various
technologies
this design pattern has been used in
everything including small talk to c
plus plus java and c sharp
dotnet web applications benefit greatly
from this powerful and straightforward
method of decoupling issues within
application
and on that note hey everyone i am
pepper khandelwal and i welcome you all
to simply learns youtube channel today
we will implement crude operations on
asp.net mvc but first let me remind you
that we have daily updates on numerous
technologies so if you are a tech geek
looking for the latest technological
innovation then try subscribing to our
youtube channel
and don't forget to hit the bell icon so

now without any further ado let's get
started with agenda for today's session
we will begin a session with a
discussion on what is asp.net mvc
then we will have a brief discussion on
the need for asp.net mvc
following that we will implement the
crude operations on asp.net mvc
finally we will wind up this session
with a few takeaways
so without any further ado let's get
started with the discussion on what is
asp.net mvc
microsoft's asp.net mvc is essentially a
web design framework
and asp.net mvc integrates mvc design
elements the most recent agile
development principles
and methodologies and the greatest
component of the existing asp.net
platform
because it is built on top of asp.net
then developers may use practically all
of the asp.net capabilities
while developing the mvc application
asp.net mvc
is not something that was created from
the grounder it is a full replacement
for the regular asp.net web forms
next let's discuss the need for asp.net
mvc
so when developing a web application
using asp.net mvc there will be no
illusions of state no page reload and no
page lifecycle
another design aim for asp.net mvc was
to be extendable throughout the whole
framework so when we discuss views they
must be displayed by the specific sort
of view engine
the whole point of employing model view
controller design pattern is to keep
things separate
an mvc component instantiate controllers
so if you don't like how mvc instantiate
your controller you can do it yourself
next let's try to implement crude
operations on asp.net mvc let me open my
visual studio
let's create a new project
we will make
an asp.net
web application
with the dotnet framework
so we will click next
then we will name this
and we see
group
make sure you choose dotnet frameworks
4.7.2
then we will hit clear
next we are asked which type of
template we want to use
so we will use mvc
next we will hit create
we will wait for it to create
and here we have our first project
now let's try and connect to a database
we will connect to
our same localdb
ms sql
local
tv server
we will name this
mvc crude
we'll click ok
it will take some time to create it
and now it is asking us
to
create it so let's create it yes
we go here
we check tables and there is none
so we will right click and add a new
table
we are waiting for its design to load up
first
we will name this one as
student id
present id
then
next
we will have
student name
we will give this one
never card care50
then
we will have student fees
this will be
end
then we will have
student city
and again we'll name it nav backhand 50
we will also name this table
so we will copy this and name it student
now we will update this
to prepare for database
now this will create this table
so we will update database
and as you can see here the table is
created
we can refresh here and as you can see
here is the table
so table data
and there's none
let's close this
now what we want to do is apply crude
operations to this table
so
it will automat when we enter it in the
forms it will automatically register it
to this table
now
we will go ahead and right click here
and we will click on manage and you get
package
here we will install
entity framework
we'll click on browse here it will do
searching
here the first one
will click on this and we will install
the five point open top version
click on install
click ok
then i accept
and it's installed now
so now
we will right click here and we will add
a new item
we will go to data and we will install
ado.net and creator model
so click on add will select ef designer
from database
if you click next it is already selected
let's make it
as tp context
next
we will choose 5.0
we will go ahead here
and select
the student table
and we will hit finish
it will take some time to create files
here
as you can see it has created an entity
data model
as
if you look at look here closely it has
created several files
let's see this one
and this is the file it has
automatically created its student.cs
which has the complete structure for the
class
of all of this taken from directly from
the table
next
let's also check
our controller
this is our home controller this is a
default controller so as you might see
there are several
functions already here let's delete the
alt functions
we'll click keep index so we because
we'll making one of them anyway
delete these we don't need them
and for the index let's write them
so we will have the
list
of
data
equals to
underscore
context
dot
student
dot
do list
then we will return
list
of
data
now
to solve this
we will need to add a context file here
we see crew db context
underscore
context
equals to new
mbc
true tv context
and that's it
we'll save this
next
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
let's create
an http
get
function
this will be
public
action
result
create
for this
we will only return
view
now
we will also create
let me make some space
here
now we will also create
an http
post method
and this method
will be again public
action
result
and this will also have
the same name
create
but
student
model
we will have
context
dot
student
[Music]
dot
add
model
then
we will have
underscore contacts
dot
save changes
and
a view back
dot
message
is equals to
data
insert
successfully
then
we will return it
return
view
let's save it
let's add
all of the pro functions as well then we
will look at them together
and here
now
we have already created the create
function
now i added some more functions so first
we have edit function
this is in http get more
and then we have http post
here i basically
what i'm doing for the get part i'm just
asking for the student id
to recognize for which
student i will be updating the data
then
in the http post method i'm basically
copying
what i am gonna put in
the text box
of student city through the name student
piece
next we have detail function
this will basically give us the
information for that id
then we have delete function
this will be able to delete the site
record
now
let's add
the view for each of these functions so
we will click on action result for index
we will right click on it and click on
add view
we will select mvc5 view we will click
add
then we have this option for the temp
index mode
we will
put list because
we are trying to create list for the
index
for the model class
we will have student
db context s
and we will click on add
it's ask us
this file is already existing
let me show you why
let me cancel this we will do it again
if you go into the view folder
you will see
these three files these are the ones
which were already created earlier so
what we will do now when i will create
to replace it it will just simply
replace this index.css html
so again
we click on add view
we'll select this we'll click on add
we'll select list
for the model class we will use student
and for the context class this and we'll
click on add
and yes we want to replace it
and it will be creating the new view for
us
let's try rebuilding it first i guess
there are some errors
we will rebuild this solution
and it succeeded
let's enable it
let's try it again
let's add view
mvc file add
list
student
mvc chrome
then click on add then yes
and this is the view for the index
folder
now
let's go back to the home function
and let's create view for the create
we will right click on this create
click on add mvc5
and
now we will select create mode
for the model class we will use student
then we have db context for this one
let's add
and this is
for the
create function
now
let's go and make
one for edit
detail and delete so i'll go add this
and
for edit we will use edit
model
student
and we will add
next
we will go for detail
we will add view
select add
for detail we will have details
student
this and add
at last we have delete
so we will add view for this
we will click on this add
then we will add delete here
then we have student then we will click
on add
now we have successfully created
a separate view for each of these
now
let's try
and run it
it will open it in the chrome
let's wait for it to load up
and here is our
table
as you can see we have a create new
function button now let's click on this
and it's asked us
for details let's give it 291
student name as
let's say my name berber
student fees as around 20 000
and for the street city as
new york
let's hit click
and it has created
let's go back to our list and as you can
see
it is already here
let's create few more few more
so let's mark it as mark
um
id2
mark
student fee as
30 grand
39
grand student city as
las vegas
and hit create again
let's go back to list
and here we are
let's try hitting on edit
now
let's try
to change this to 40 grand
and this
new
orleans
let's add it
and it has changed
we can also delete this
now let's get back to our slides
finally let's look at the final
takeaways to conclude this session
first up we have asp.net mvc that makes
it easier to add interactivity and
responsiveness to existing project
next we have asp.net mvc which gives you
complete control over produce html and a
clear separation of responsibility
following that we have direct html
control also implies improved
accessibility for established
conformance and
developing web standards after that we
have asp.net mvc
is ideal for web applications that
require
assistance of large teams of developer
as well as web designer that require
high level of control over the
application's behavior
then
asp.net mvc simplifies complexity
management by splitting an application
into the model
the view and the controller
at last
asp.net mvc
improves test-driven development support
that is tdd

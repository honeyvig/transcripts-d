black marble is a group of really
enthusiastic technology loving Geeks
that have established themselves as the
go-to guys if you've got a difficult
problem devops is a big part of black
marble it bridged the gap between it and
operations for us two serve came about
initially from one of our customers
Cambridge sh constabulary one great
thing that two serve is enabled is an
idea of a remote Detective When officers
are on the scene of a crime they're
Gathering evidence and feeding it into
the two serve event dashboard a
detective back at a station can now look
at that in real time and guide the
actions of the people on
scene in developing two serve we've
really put into practice everything that
we've learned along the way around
devops and Alm Visual Studio team
Services provides an end to-end solution
for us from the Inception of an idea in
the pub as you write it on the back of a
beer mat we can check our coding and a
whole variety of crossplatform solutions
we can then build our Sol solution and
deploy it out again into a whole
heterogeneous areas so it's now really
giving us a selection of tools that
allow us to address the real world needs
of our clients by combining Visual
Studio team Services build and release
with Azure resource templates we were
able to help one of our Marquee
customers take their deployment time
down from over four months to just over
an hour we've quadrupled our devops
practice over the past year the risk if
you don't keep up to date with the new
technologies that enabled devops is that
you'll be left behind it is important
that our clients trust us and the fact
that we're a Microsoft partner is very
important to them it gives our customers
the confidence that even though we may
not be the largest supplier on the Block
we have a proven track record of
delivery and we have a very big friend
standing behind us to support us knowing
that we're transforming policing is a
big part of why I love my job if we can
get to serve into as many police forces
as possible it means that all police
forces can collaborate and have that
digitized ation and transformational
experience

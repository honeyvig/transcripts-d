hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about adjacency
but before we begin if you haven't

so now without any further delay let's
begin
this session will help you understand
what an array in c is
after that let's look at the array
declaration and initialization in c
followed by how to access an array of
elements and finally the types of arrays
in c now let's begin by understanding
what an array in c is
an array is a homogeneous collection of
elements of this same data type
that means similar type of elements are
stored under one name call it as array
name and also the array of elements
stored in a consecutive blocks of memory
suppose you want to store 50 numbers so
for that you must create 50 variables
separately to hold the values
instead you can use arrays that contain
more than one value under a single array
name which becomes easy to access the
elements randomly and also avoids the
memory overflow
let's look at the diagram to see how the
array elements are stored one after the
other
consider yen elements to be stored in an
array and in that case all elements are
stored one after the other
element one
is the first element and the nth element
is the last element of an array
in memory whenever the consecutive free
space is available the memories are
located as per the mentioned array size
moving ahead let's understand the array
declaration in c
array declaration is similar to the
variable declaration
but in the array declaration we
mentioned the array size
let's have a look at the syntax
we have data type followed by array name
and the array size
for example
data type could be any type like int
double float cad etc in this example the
data type is int and array name is a and
the size of an array is 5.
once the array is declared the memory is
allocated as per the mentioned array
size
in arrays the index starts with 0 to n
minus 1. so to store 5 elements the
index starts from 0
then 1
2 3 and 4.
always the index will be 1 less than the
mentioned array size
next we have array initialization in c
one way of initializing the array of
elements is during the declaration let's
look at the following syntax
first data type followed by array name
and size and by using assignment
operator equal to list all the elements
separated by the comma operator inside
the curly brackets and semicolon at the
end
for example
int year 5 is equal to the elements are
10 15 20 25 and 30.
as i said the memories are located after
the array declaration
and array elements are 10 15 20 25 and
30 will be assigned starting from the
index e of 0
followed by 15 at the index e of 1 and
so on till the index year 4.
next up we have how to access array
elements in c
we can access the elements randomly by
specifying the array index
the syntax to access the elements is
mention the array name and the index of
an element
suppose you want to access element 15
and even though it is the second element
the index would be 1. so specify the
array name and the index that is a of 1
next if we want to access the first
element of an array then the index would
be 0
similarly to access the last element we
specify a of 4
and to access the third element give
year 2 followed by a of 3 to access the
element 25
now we know what an array in c is and
its declaration initialization and the
way to access the array elements
let's move ahead and understand the
types of arrays in c
arrays are classified into three types
first we have one dimensional array
next two dimensional array and finally
multi-dimensional arrays
let us go through them in detail
first let's start with one dimensional
array
one-dimensional arrays are also linear
arrays that accept one subscript to
mention the size of an array
look at the given representation of
one-dimensional array
the elements are stored consecutively in
the memory
and we have already discussed the array
declaration however let us go through
the syntax once again
we have a data type array name and size
for example
int as a data type
a as an array name and the size is 15.
now let us try to execute a simple
program to understand the
one-dimensional array and let's see how
to access and change the array elements
using one-dimensional array we're gonna
print the array elements
and for that we have declared the array
and we have mentioned the array size
four
and we have also initialized the array
elements and they are 5
10 15 and 20.
and using the for loop
i is equal to 0 till i less than 4
that means the index less than 4 it
gonna print all the elements
so now let's run the program
and here is the output the array
elements are 5
10 15 and 20.
next let's try to access the array
element
so suppose you want to access the second
element of an array so you can mention
the array index using the printf
function so for the second element
the index would be 1.
so let's run it
and here we go the second element that
is 10.
so suppose you want to change the array
elements like for example you want first
element to be two and not five so for
that mention the array name ea
and the size sorry the index 0
and equal to the new element that is 2.
so let's print all the elements and
check whether the element is changed or
not
so save the program and run
so as you can see
the element is changed from 5 to 2 so
now the elements are 2 10 15 and 20.

next we have two dimensional arrays
a 2d array is similar to a
one-dimensional array but it accepts two
subscripts
in 2d array the data is stored in rows
and columns so using a 2d array we can
perform matric arithmetic operations
like addition subtraction multiplication
etc
now let's look at the given
representation of a two dimensional
array
the index of the 2d array starts with 0
0 then 0 1 0 2 and followed by the next
row 1 0 1 1 and 1 2.
let's have a look at the syntax to
understand it in a better way
we have a data type array name followed
by two subscripts the first subscript
describes the number of rows and the
second subscript describes the number of
columns present
for example
if we have two rows and three columns
the index would be zero zero zero one
zero two and one zero one one and one
two
this indicates the first element is at
the index zeroth row zero column and the
second element at zeroth row first
column and so on
now let's execute a program using 2d
array by taking inputs from the user
so using a for loop variables i and j
are used to take the inputs of rows and
columns
followed by that we are going to
represent the elements in a matrix
format
so first
i is equal to 0 that is i is initialized
to 0 and checks i less than 2
and if the condition is satisfied the
control comes to the inner follow
and the j is equal to 0 and checks
whether j is less than 3
and if the condition is satisfied it
will print the first element
a of i j
and again the control goes back to the
inner for loop
and increment the column by 1 that is j
by 1
and now i value is same that is 0 and j
is incremented by 1
and it prints the second element of the
matrix that is the first row and second
column element
and this process will continue till j
less than three condition is invalid
again the control goes back to the order
for loop
and increment the i value by 1
and prince's second row first column
element and this process repeats it
reaches the second row third column
now let's run and see the output
so enter the random elements
okay
and here we got the output the elements
are represented in a matrix format
now let's perform the addition operation
on the two matrices
we have matrix a and b of the size 2
into 3
and the elements of matrix a is 1
2 3 4 5 and 6 and the elements of matrix
b is 6 2 3 4 5 and 1.
so this
elements are
added up and store it in the matrix c
so for that we have a statement c of i j
is equal to a of i j plus b of i j
so that means the element of a matrix c
a
is added with the elements of matrix b
and store it in the matrix c
so the process happens the first element
of the matrix a
is added with the first element of
matrix b
and this will repeat till it reaches the
second row third column
so now let's run it
and here we got the output
so the element 1 plus 6 is added that is
7
and stored in the matrix c
similarly 2 plus 2 4
three plus three six
and four plus four is added and the
value is eight
five plus five ten
six plus one seven
up next we have a three dimensional
array
a 3d array is a multi-dimensional array
that accepts three subscripts
which is represented by the block size
row size and column size
the example for 3d array could be a cube
and the syntax is data type array name
followed by three subscripts
the first subscript represents the
number of blocks and the second one is
the number of rows and the third
subscript represents the number of
columns
for example
int data type array name as a
block size 2 row size 3 and the column
size is 4.
so now let's execute a program to
understand the working of 3d array
so we are going to execute a program
using 3d array and for that we have rna
and we have the variables
i j and k
so i represents the number of block and
the size we have given is 2 j the number
of rows and the size is 3 and k for the
number of columns and the size is 3.
so first it will take the inputs from
the user and then
print the
output
the working is similar to 2d array the
only difference is that when i is equal
to 0 it prints the first block of
elements and when i is equal to 1 it
prints the second block of elements and
here the working is similar to the 2d
array
so let's run it
so let's enter the random numbers
and here we go the output
so the first block of elements are
one two three four five six seven eight
nine and the second block of elements
are one two three four five six and
seven eight one
so with this we have come to the end of

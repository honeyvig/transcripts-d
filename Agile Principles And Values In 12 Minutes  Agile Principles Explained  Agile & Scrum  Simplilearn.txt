let's get started with introduction to
Agile Manifesto the agile Manifesto is a
seminal document in the field of
software development created in 200 one
by 17 software developers who sought to
outline a more flexible and efficient
approach to project management and
development it emphasizes individuals
and interactions working software
customer collaboration and responding to
change over traditional processes
documentation contract negotiation and
plan following this Manifesto has since
become the foundation for agile
methodologies promoting a flexible team
oriented approach that values
adaptability and customer satisfaction
above rigid adherance to plans with the
manifesto in mind let's start exploring
the the four core values of agile the
four core values of agile focus on
people and results rather than rigid
processes individuals and interactions
over processes and tools prioritizing
teamwork and communication above strict
adherence to tools and processes imagine
a team deciding together how to solve a
problem instead of just following a
manual it's like choosing a group
discussion over filling out phones
working software over comprehensive
documentation valuing functional
software that meets user needs over
detailed paperwork think of it as
cooking a meal that tastes good and
serves its purpose rather than writing a
detailed recipe book before the meal is
even made customer collaboration over
contract negotiation emphasizing ongoing
engagement with customers rather than
sticking strictly to initial agreements
it's like working with a home builder
who listens and adapts to your changing
needs during construction instead of
sticking strictly to the original plan
responding to change over following a
plan being open to change and adapting
plans as needed instead of rigidly
following a set path picture a road trip
where you're open to taking a more
scenic route based on new information
rather than sticking to the fastest
route Google Maps suggested initially
these values guide the aent methodology
towards flexibility efficiency and
customer satisfaction the 12 principles
of agile software development the 12
principles of agile software development
as outlined in the agile Manifesto
advocate for customer satisfaction
through early and continuous software
delivery prioritizes getting a
functional product to the customer as
soon as possible then updating it
regularly example A Team releases a
basic version of an app to meet initial
user needs then adds new features based
on feedback welcoming changing
requirements even late in development it
is time consuming to handle large and
complicated work but when managing
project activities therefore a better
strategy is to break the task into
manageable sizable chunks in addition it
would be simpler for the team members to
see possible bottlenecks and deal with
delays if the clients were always kept
informed for example if users need a new
feature because their needs have changed
the development team Works to
incorporate it even if it wasn't in the
original plan frequent delivery of
working software according to the agile
methodology working software is frequent
delivered in a shorter amount of time
team members must consistently raise
their performance standards as a result
of this iterative process for example
delivering updates every 2 weeks to
continuously improve and adjust the
software based on user input business
people and developers must work together
daily throughout the project in order to
ensure that the business and development
sides of the project can communicate
effectively and more importantly
collaborate a bridge between them must
be built to facilitate an intellectual
exchange that both parties can agree on
make use of the same tools you would
have used in managing remote teams for
example regular meetings between the
client and the team to discuss the
Project's Direction and adapt as
necessary build projects around
motivated individuals give them the
environment and support they need and
trust them to get the job done the
project manager must establish a
supportive and stimulating environment
where team members are free to express
their ideas and make recommendations for
enhancing the output of the group this
results in a massive Improvement in
their General performance eventually
aiding the project for example allowing
a developer to choose their tools or
method of working to solve the problem
can lead to more Innovative and
effective Solutions the most efficient
and effective method of conveying
information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation
efficient communication among the
parties concerned is stressed strongly
in the agile Manifesto thanks to
improvements in communication
Technologies it's now simpler instead of
having a quick conference in the office
or participants can now meet via video
conferencing for example solving
misunderstandings or clarifying
requirements through direct discussion
rather than through emails or reports
working software is the primary measure
of progress delivering a functional
product that pleases the consumer is the
single determinant that can guarantee
success before agile numerous success
metrics decreased the quality of of the
finished product for example a team
focuses on delivering a basic but
operational piece of software first
rather than ensuring every document is
perfect agel processes promote
sustainable development the sponsors
developers and users should be able to
maintain a constant Pace indefinitely
burnout will occur if you work on a
project for a long time it's inevitable
avoid placing too much of a workload on
your employees the value of your project
will be affected so a assemble the best
team for the job that will work hard but
refrain from overworking themselves and
endangering the Project's quality for
example instead of pushing for long
hours to meet an unrealistic deadline
the team sets a realistic timeline that
allows for steady progress without
overtime continuous attention to
technical excellence and good design
enhances agility any agile team's main
goal should be to provide value to the
client therefore a multi-kill team that
can manage all the projects technical
components and offers the chance for
continual Improvement is crucial for
example regularly refactoring code to
improve its structure without changing
its external Behavior Simplicity the art
of maximizing the amount of work not
done is essential you should avoid
adding extraneous complexity to a
project if you want to complete it
swiftly you can accomplish this in
various ways including by using agile
tools which eliminate busy work and
offer you more significant influence
over all project related decisions
for example developers decide not to add
a feature that only a few users would
use keeping the system more
straightforward and easier to maintain
the best architectures requirements and
Designs emerge from self-organizing
teams simply said a self-organized
Workforce with decision-making autonomy
would function better since each team
member would be responsible for meeting
client expectations rather than a loan
project manager for example a team
decides who will work on what tasks
based on on each member's strengths and
current workload rather than having a
manager assigned tasks at regular
intervals the team reflects on how to
become more effective then tunes and
adjusts Its Behavior accordingly agile
techniques are constructed on the notion
of iteration where teams consistently
enhance their game by learning from
their previous wrongdoings project
managers should Inspire team meetings
where everyone evaluates their work and
discusses how to develop their
management and technical skills for
example at at the end of each
development cycle the team needs to
discuss what they can change to work
more efficiently in the next cycle with
core values at principles in mind let's
have a look at implications of agile
values and principles the implications
of agile values and principles revolve
around fostering a culture of
flexibility collaboration and continuous
Improvement they lead to enhanced
adaptability to change allowing teams
and businesses to respond swiftly to
Market shifts and customer needs in
increased customer satisfaction by
prioritizing customer feedback and
delivering value early and often
improved product quality through
iterative development and a focus on
technical Excellence more efficient and
motivated teams due to empowerment and a
focus on individuals and interactions
these points underline how adopting
agile can transform organizational
workflows and outcomes now let's see
some real world applications of aile
innovation in tech companies like
Spotify utilize a agile to Foster
Innovation rapidly testing and deploying
new features adapting to Market changes
Netflix applies agile principles to
quickly adapt to user preferences and
technological advancements maintaining
its market leader position banking
sector agility banks have adopted agile
to improve their Digital Services making
customer transactions smoother and more
secure Healthcare efficiency agile
methodologies help Healthcare Providers
streamline operations and improve
patient care through faster more
responsive Services manufacturing
flexibility even in manufacturing agile
enables companies to respond swiftly to
Market demands and supply chain

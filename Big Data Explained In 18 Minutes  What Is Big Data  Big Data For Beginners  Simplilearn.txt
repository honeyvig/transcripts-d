pick data
the name itself says that it contains a
massive amount of data
according to a wire article google ceo
mentioned that between the dawn of time
and 2003
humans had created five hexa bytes of
data
and by 2010 this much data was being
generated every two days and by 2021
it was happening every 40 minutes
in fact there is a saying that every
grain of sand on the planet has around
400 000 bytes of data
carrying these interesting facts let's
move forward to know more about big data
hi everyone i am welcome to simply lunch
youtube channel
in this session we will explore big data
if you want more amazing tech related
videos do like subscribe and hit the
bell icon to stay tuned
let's get to the video to learn more
about big data without any further delay
we will begin this session by discussing
the evolution of big data
what data is and its workflow
then we will have a look at its
applications
moving forward we will understand the
different types of big data and then the
five is concept
after that we will understand the
benefits and challenges of big data
and then we will explore its various
career opportunities
and then next
we will understand what major tools are
required in big data and finally we will
end this session by discussing its
future
let's look at the evolution of big data
in human history since the dawn of time
as we know humans have created large
amounts of data since evolution
one interesting fact is that according
to folks 90 percent of the world's data
has been generated in the past couple of
years
furthermore the technological
advancement made in the last century are
more than those and made about 2000
years
now we know how big data has evolved
let's understand what big data is in a
simpler manner
big data is a collection of huge amounts
of data that is continuously growing
with ever increasing speed
this data has a diverse quantity of
information
the world generates approx 40 exabytes
of data in the form of text music phone
calls emails etc and could be collected
from anywhere like social media networks
and websites
this data is also so massive that
traditional database management system
can't manage it so now we have a better
understanding of big data let's look at
how it works
in a way we can say we did understand us
more than we understand ourselves
the motive behind big data is that the
further you learn the more you can
acquire and make a decision or discover
an answer
but to understand this concept we need
to know how big data works
so the main steps are
collecting data
collecting data is a process of
gathering information from raw data that
can be used to evaluate outcomes and
find answers to relevant questions
processing data
it includes converting the information
collected from raw data into valuable
and usable information
cleaning data
it includes detecting and removing
corrupt and inaccurate data from
processed information
analyzing data
it consists of various methods to
evaluate the data according to the
requirements
now that we know how big data works
let's look at some of its applications
by examining vast amount of data big
data helps firms make better decisions
dev server logs internet click stream
data social media content and activity
report text from customers emails phone
call details and machine data gathered
by numerous sensors
big data find its application in various
sectors like manufacturing healthcare
education media and entertainment
banking and securities
so let's understand all these big data
applications in detail
in manufacturing there are some main
advantages of adopting big data
applications such as
monitoring product quality and floss
planning the supply
forecasting of output
raising energy effectiveness
and support for manufacturing mass
customization
healthcare
big data analytics have enhanced
healthcare so researchers are analyzing
the data to find out which therapies are
more efficient for specific elements
what trends and drug side effects and
gather other crucial knowledge that can
benefit patient and lower cost
coming to education
big data is used by organization that
conduct online educational courses to
find candidates who are interested in
those courses
if someone searches for a youtube
tutorial video on a certain topic an
organization offering online or offline
course on that topic will subsequently
send that individual an online
advertisement for their course
coming to media and entertainment
companies that offer media and
entertainment services such as netflix
amazon prime and spotify analyze the
user data they acquire
to determine the business strategy
information is gathered and evaluated
about the types of videos and music
consumers are watching and listening to
how long they spend on a website etc
coming to banking and securities
big data is used by the security
exchange commission to track the
activity in the financial markets
huge data is used by retail traders
speak banks hedge funds and other big
boys in the financial markets this
sector also heavily relies on big data
for risk analytics including enterprise
risk management and anti-money
laundering
so these were some applications of big
data in various sectors
knowing about application we have come
through a lot now let's discuss its
types
there are three types of big data
structure data
it's an organized set of data that has
defined parameters
it is arranged in a table like format
with rows and columns so it can be
worked on with these
for example it includes the date
address credit card numbers and your
locations
and a structured data
an unorganized set of data that
compromises nearly 80 to 90 percent of
the total data
this data is created daily through
social networks and many other things
and is not transcribed or tagged in
organized manner
for example
ml ai iot and analytics
coming to semi-structured data a
combination of structured and
unstructured data
it also includes organized text and data
not formatted in conventional ways
some examples of semi-structured data
sources are emails
xml and other markup languages
talking about big data its 5v's concept
always plays a major role in
understanding the data
let's have a look at each of its five
concepts understanding the five these
enables data scientists to get more
value out of their data and helps the
organization where they work to become
more customer centric coming to volume
the first of the five years of big data
is volume it refers to the quantity of
data available or the initial size of
the data is collected which can be
thought as the foundation of big data
as an example netflix has over 86
million subscriber worldwide and streams
more than 125 million hours material
daily which is over 60 petabyte in size
next is velocity
velocity is the second of the five v's
of big theta
it describes the rate at which data is
created and transferred
in order for business to make informed
business decision data has to flow
quickly so that it is accessible when
needed
as an example google receives about 63
000 queries per second
the writing variety is the next being
the 5 v's of big data the diversity of
the data is referred to as variety data
may be gathered by an organization from
a variety of sources with different
degree of value
for example data could be in any format
like structured axle sheets or
semi-structured xml files
next is velocity
the fourth of the five we big data
raises velocity
it speaks of the reliability and
excellence of the data
the gathered information can be
incomplete or unable to offer any useful
information
so in general it refers to the degree of
confidence in the data that has been
gathered
for example data collected in the
medical experiments like dna analysis
highly volatile value
value is the fifth and final v in the
big data this refers to the benefit that
big data can offer it is necessary to be
able to extract value from big data
because the value of bit data greatly
depends on the insights that can be
obtained from them
for example
the analytics used in the health care
providers the information which is very
helpful for the society
nevertheless the advantages that big
data come to white are well worth the
time and affords so let's talk about its
benefit
customer experience
it can be improved by using the
information gathered from big data by
suggesting products that are more
individualized to the customers and
according to their choices
so the next benefit is decision making
by identifying patterns in big data it
can be tracked whether the solution is
solving the problem or not
cost saving
organization can gain by analyzing big
data and have an increase in their
revenue and a cost reduction
so the next benefit is fraud detection
this benefits in saving cost and
maximizing revenue
offering a better customer experience
also speed up the fraud analysis
eliminating manual work identifying
fraud before it occurs and ensuring a
high fraud detection rate by removing
false positive
so now let's discuss the last benefit on
our list which is data security
big data security can be readily
addressed with the information resources
qualified labor a clear coping plan and
commitment to data integrity and privacy
businesses can achieve their ultimate
objective of utilizing data for better
customer experience and retention if
there are no risk to big data
as we know big data has some benefits
but it also has some challenges so let's
discuss that challenges in big data
big data has some problem in
implementations as they require quick
attention and must be dealt quickly as
they can have a negative outcome
so let's examine some big data
challenges
lack of knowledge professionals
any company that deals with big data
challenges know how difficult it is to
find big data experts
so data handling tools have advanced
strategy but most professionals have not
to close this gap effective measures are
needed
the next challenge that we have is
integrating data
in a business information is gathered
from a variety of sources including
social networking pages erp software
customer logs
financial reports emails powerpoint
presentation and employee written
reports
it could be difficult to organize
reports after combining all of this data
the next challenge on our list is big
data tool selection when choosing the
simplest tool for massive data analysis
and storage companies are often confused
which data storage technology is simpler
edge base or cacindra
now let's discuss our last challenge
securing data
one of the biggest issue of big data is
securing these enormous databases
companies generally put data security to
later phases because they are so busy
understanding story and analyzing their
data sets
a stolen document on knowledge breach
could cost companies millions
so i hope i am able to make you
understand the benefits and challenges
of big data
now it's time to get an understanding of
its various career opportunities
those with the talent for understanding
and applying data for decision making
would be wise to pursue a profession in
big data
this section provides a high level
overview of job opportunities and
fundamental skill needs in the big data
domain
the following are some titles and
responsibilities
big data engineer
big data engineers use massive amount of
data to produce insights for corporate
diseases
additionally their response for
developing and managing the hardware and
software architecture of the company you
typically need two or three years of
expertise in the field to be hired for
the role of a data engineer
next we have a data architect
an i.t expert who implements data
storage and management solution and plan
future databases using computer and
design talents
recruiters prefer applicants who are
fluent and have excellent sql and
example skills
data scientist
a person with a keen knowledge of
scientific methods and algorithms to
extract necessary insights from noisy
and unstructured data the position of
data scientist often requires a master
degree next on the list we have a data
analyst
it can be defined as someone with the
skill to drag out useful information
required by the organization
our technical graduate degree and
knowledge of microsoft ex sharepoint and
sql database are minimal qualification
let's talk about the last position on
our list that you can get in the world
of big data
security engineer an engineer with a job
of managing and controlling network
security protocols and protecting
sensitive data
security breached protocols and computer
forensic knowledge are needed
data tools assess the management of
large data sets and the identification
of patents
so if you want to work in big data
industry you will need to learn how to
use these technologies
with this we have come to our second
last topic of this big data session
which is big data tools
big data tools
apache hadoop is an open source platform
for storing and analyzing big data on
commodity hardware
it is written in java and allows for
quantum data processing due to its
clustered architecture which allows it
to run on numerous machines
simultaneously
the next tool that we have is apache
spark
apache spark is comparable to hadoop but
unlike hadoop it enables real time and
batch processing
it can also perform calculation in
memory making it hundred times faster
than hadoop
for efficient quality execution it
contains 80 high level operators
coming to apache flink apache splink is
an open source tool for processing
bounded and unbounded data streams
it is written in java and scala and
provide high accuracy result even for
late arriving data providing high
performance and low latency
it also supports even time and state
management
the next tool that we have is apache
storm apache storm is an open source
framework for dealing with unbounded
data streams it has the advantage of
being compatible with any programming
language and support json based
protocols
so the last tool in our bucket is
mongodb
mongodb is a cross platform big data
tool with an open source nosql database
it is simple to setup requires little
maintenance is dependable and cost
effective and offers data-driven
solutions
as of now we know much about big data
lastly let's discuss the future of big
data

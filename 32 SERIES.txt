hi everyone from today we are going to
discuss 32 important points in every
video which are really important for
need we shall start with irrigating
solutions number one irrigating solution
used in sonic instruments is water
number 2 irrigating solution used in
ultrasonic is sodium hypochlorite number
3 irrigating solution used fill
champagne test is sodium hypochloride
number for irrigating solution mixture
which forms para chloro Anila nice
mixture of sodium hypochlorite and floor
extreme number 5 irrigating solution
which is effective against Inter caucus
faecalis is Mt Airy number 6 irrigating
solution mixture used in queue mixes adt
and chloride stream number 7 irrigating
solution with good substantivity is
klore extreme

now let's discuss about fathers in
pathology number 8 father of medicine
ease Hippocrates number 9 father of
modern medicine it's Sir William Osler
number 10 father of pathologies rudolf
virchow member Levin father of Museum
ease John Hunter number 12 father of
clinical pathologies Paul Ehrlich number
13 father of blood transfusion ease Karl
Landsteiner number 14 father of cytology
georgian papinek law now we shall study
about rate limiting enzymes the
metabolic pathway and its respective
enzyme number 15 in glycolysis pathway
the rate-limiting enzyme is
phosphofructokinase number 16 for
glycogenesis it is glycogen synthase
number 17 for glycogenolysis it is
phosphor release number 18 for urea
synthesis the rate-limiting enzyme is
our genus car bomb and phosphatase
number 19 in cholesterol synthesis
pathway the rate-limiting enzyme is HMG
co-reductase
number 20 in uric acid pathway the
rate-limiting enzyme is xanthine oxidase
number 21 in gluconeogenesis the
rate-limiting enzyme is fructose 1 6
bisphosphate is number 22 in fatty acid
synthesis the rate-limiting enzyme is
acetyl co a carboxylase guys now let's
study about some common drugs acting on
ion channels the drug and its specific
ion channel
[Music]
number 23 Didrik quinidine it blocks
myocardial sodium channels number 24
nifedipine it acts on all type of
voltage sensitive calcium channels
number 25 Nikko rondalee it opens ATP
since two potassium channels number
twenty-six sulfonylurea it inhibits
pancreatic ATP since 2 potassium
channels number 27 amiloride
it inhibits renal epithelial sodium
channels number 28 it doe sucks amide it
inhibits T type of calcium channels in
thalamic neurons number 29
phenytoin it prolongs the inactivated
state of voltage sense to neuronal
sodium channels coming to the final part
of this video it is about steroids we
shall study some important points
regarding steroids here this steroid
dosage depends upon the control of hair
disease your health care provider may
increase or decrease the dose to prevent
breakthrough symptoms and to hello the
adrenal glands time to function again
coming to point number 30 if the patient
is juicing doses below 30 milligrams
there is no need to change the dose
since adrenal axis is not affected and
if he is using 30 to 50 milligrams of
those then we should double the dose
since adrenal axis is not affected if it
is more than 50 milligrams then there is
no need of any extra supplements number
31 if the patient is undergoing an oral
surgery either under GA or not then the
total doses should be given on the day
of surgery and should extend one more
day depending upon the infection amount
of blood loss and duration of surgery
number 32 if the patient is undergoing a
major surgery
a bull whenever under GA with blood loss
then a daily doses should be given with
an extra 50 milligrams equivalent
hydrocortisone IV during surgery and it
should be continued every eight hours
for 72 hours that's it for today guys we
shall discuss some more important stuff
in upcoming videos

- [Narrator] Assigning
specific subscription GUIDs.
Rather than assigning an individual user
and allowing the next
available subscription
to be assigned
you may prefer to assign
a specific subscription
of your choosing.
To assign a specific
available subscription,
you will need to reference
that subscription's GUID.
The GUID for each subscription is listed
in your subscription details.
To find this, choose export
to get a full list of assigned
and available subscriptions.
This will serve as a reference to fill out
the bulk upload template.
Once you've identified the specific GUID
or GUIDs you'd like to assign
return to the portal to
begin the assignment process.
Select add and then bulk
add from the dropdown menu.
Then download the Excel template
from the dialogue box and save it locally.
This template allows for the assignment
of one or multiple subscriptions.
In the required fields of the template
enter the details for the
new subscriber or subscribers
including the specific GUID
you identified previously
and its corresponding subscription level.
Once complete, save the template again.
Then return to the
dialogue box in the portal
to upload your saved file.
Click okay and you'll see the
newly assigned subscriptions
listed in the grid below.

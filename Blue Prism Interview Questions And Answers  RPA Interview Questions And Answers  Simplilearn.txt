hey everyone welcome to another video by
simplylearn
i am sure you must have watched our
previous videos on blueprism
if you haven't watched them already i
would suggest you to go through
tutorials on blueprism
blueprism is a global leader in
intelligent enterprise automation
transforming the way employees work by
making it simple for individuals to
automate operations
blue prism helps enterprises improve
operational efficiency and agility
if you are planning to attend an
interview for an rpa or blue prism
developer role here is a comprehensive
list of the most frequently asked blue
prism interview questions with answers
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started we will first look at
the beginner level interview questions
what is blue prism
blue prism is a software that develops
enterprise robotic process automation
allowing businesses to automate complex
end-to-end operations
blueprism developed the virtual
workforce platform concept and works on
the enterprise robotic process
automation platform that is strong
highly scalable secure and reliable
blueprism software complements
standardity solutions by utilizing an
agile virtual workforce that follows
rule-based business process and
interacts with system the same way users
do
blue prisms rp software solution
automates tasks that would otherwise be
carried out manually by humans or
through significant customization of
current i.t systems which would result
in a higher level of automation with
significantly lesser investment and
faster deployment
explain the different types of tabs in
blue prism dashboard
there are six types of tabs in blue
prism
the first tab is home
the homepage includes many charts that
provide information on the blueprism
database
blueprism studio is a critical component
through which we build actual automation
actions with studio we can automate a
process build a process using flow add
logic calculations and intelligence
without writing any code
we can also drag in actions calculations
loops and more
in studio we can connect the blocks in
preferred order we can use intelligent
skills from digital exchange
the studios are divided into two
categories object studio and process
studio
control room
the control room is the key
administrative point in blue prism where
it handles the control monitoring
execution and scheduling of process
executions on dispersed bots
the control room assigns the processes
to digital workers users can quickly
start a process by dragging it onto a
resource
analytics
blueprism analytics is a module that
allows you to see data graphically in
the form of charts such as pie chart bar
chart column gauge and line
releases the release manager is used to
manage configuration package import and
export between multiple blueprism
settings
system
administrators use the system tab to
manage users
explain the features of blue prism
provides intelligent execution
technology organizations can instruct
the autonomous engine on process
priorities feed amounts of work and
leave it to run without human
involvement responding to systems
business scenario and change in priority
robots like humans can be used to do
tasks based on sla volume and priority
and adjust and change robot allocation
dynamically without human intervention
high security
a software robot securely locks into an
application and manipulates the
presentation layer in the same manner a
person would but in a controlled
non-invasive environment ensuring that
the application's integrity is never
affected
on premises or in the cloud on-premises
or hybrid enterprise deployment
provisioned in a public or a private
cloud
the robots are existing and running any
operation set in blue prism can be
conducted on any number of robots in the
virtual workforce
microsoft sql server
blue prism is built on microsoft.net
framework it is technologically flexible
working across the other platforms and
technologies such as a mainframe windows
app wpf app java sap exchange and many
more
scalability blue prism is object
oriented allowing for a rapid
scalability by utilizing reusable items
and libraries
analytics and reporting provides high
quality data that can be used to produce
relevant bi and mi reporting and provide
inline process statistics and real-time
operational insights by capturing each
step
work use work use provides a q-centric
approach for dynamically controlling the
number of resources or robots operating
against a given queue at any given time
what is a process studio the process
studio is created as a diagram that
looks much like a common business flow
diagram process studio allows the
company rit to design build edit and
test process made out of reusable blue
prism elements
as the library of business object grows
actions can be scheduled and controlled
in the process layer the top tier of the
blue prism architecture process studio
provides a similar interface to object
studio and allows you to sequence and
test business logic control loops
variables and object calls invisible
business flow
what is object studio
object studio is the design canvas on
which blue prism robot is programmed to
conduct the fundamental system
activities that serve as a foundation of
process the presentation layer which
provides a library of elements to
operate quickly models and validates the
target desktop application
we have several types of activities
within the object such as modular
application to spy the elements
initialize page and cleanup page
what is control room in blue prism
control room allows businesses or id
services to schedule perform and control
processes blue prism platform
administrators use the control room
interface to monitor and review the
status of connected runtime resources in
the production environment
the interface also allows for manual
process start and stop automated process
schedule setting and extensive
management information and dig downs
into blue prism task queues
in production environment process are
run from a control room from control
room processors do not run on a version
of blue prism that is local to your
desktop but is instead run on an
external resource known as digital
workers which can be found in the
resource area
what is the environment variable
the environment variable is a type of
exposure in data item in which data item
value is easily changed without using
the processor object it is available in
the system tab under the process section
which are the data types available in
blue prism
data items can store a range of data
types though each data item within a
process must be assigned a specific data
type to store
the data types available in blue prism
are as follows
date
flag date time number text password time
image and binary
explain weight stage
weight stage enables business objects to
pause and wait for an application to
load or a condition to be met before
continuing
weight conditions can be applied to
weight stages to evaluate whether a
condition exists within a specific
period
the weight condition produces a flag
value determining which of the two
branches the logic will flow down
it is best to include a conditional wage
stage at the start of every object
diagram
it is possible to set multiple weight
conditions for a weight stage by adding
additional rows into the action area
the weight stage simultaneously checks
each weight condition it doesn't require
all weight conditions to be met even if
one condition is met the path will be
determined if none of the weight
conditions are met the action will time
out
explain the benefits of blue prism
automated speed
days and weeks to automate a process in
blue prism that would take months and
years to automate using a standard
automation methodologies
less expense robots are programmed with
the business rules of repetitive
clerical duties and deployed to drive
existing applications eliminating the
requirement for costly integration and
process redesign expertise
improved performance small specialist
ability within the it department
collaborates with the robotic workforce
to train them manage referrals and
continuously enhance their operational
performance
secure the robotic automation platform
is secure audited and governed within
the governance iit corridor the usage of
software robots invariably increases
compliance with applicable data
standards and confidentiality
scalable
because the software robots operate in a
virtualized environment they can be
rapidly scaled up and down based on the
demand
what is exceptional handling in blue
prism
exceptional handling is critical part of
any blue prism solution
an exception is a problem that arises
during the execution of a process or an
object when errors are encountered in
blue prism it generates exceptions
the managing of exceptions in unattended
automation is defined as exception
handling it ensures that defaults can be
automatically fixed if possible or that
they are easily identified repairable by
system administrators or that they can
be forwarded for human completion if
necessary exception handling success is
determined by how well it is implemented
throughout the development phase
explain the different stages of
exception handling the different stages
of exceptional handling are
discovery resume and exception
in recovery stage begins a block for
handling exceptions
in resume stage it ends a block for
handling exceptions in exception stage
explicitly rises an exception in the
execution of a process or an object
explain the applications of blueprism
blueprism's rpa software is used in the
following process types
rules based processing using a
structured digital inputs such as credit
card activation or fraud detection
transactional processing that is
repeated such as sim swaps or invoicing
processing
transaction quantities that are high
such as building or new handset order
processing
issues with process adherence quality
such as policy renewables or policy
migrations
complex mission critical procedures such
as pension redemptions and financial
reconciliation changes in demand or
backlogs such as new product launches
using hr onboarding or the introduction
of new online product where no
integration exists
now let us look at the intermediate
level interview questions
what is an application modeler which are
the different types of spying modes
present in it
a business object aims to integrate with
an application to make the business
accessible for use by a blue prism
process to create the integration you
must connect the business object to the
application by creating an application
modeler
this can be achieved via application
modeler within the object studio
the process of creating a logical
representation of an application by
identifying and capturing elements from
the user interface of the application is
called spying
the four different types of spying modes
are as follows
win32 mode html mode accessibility mode
and region mode
explain circular paths in blue prism
blue prism is designed to automate
repetitive work and inclusion of
circular paths looping process diagrams
enables some steps to be repeated over
and over again
components that are essential for
building circular path which will allow
a process flow to loop through
then progress to the end once the loop
limit is met
components that are essential for
building a circular path which will
allow a process flow to loop through
then process to the end once the loop
limit is met
explain the types of exceptions in blue
prism
the three types of exceptions in blue
prism are internal exception
internal exceptions come based on our
missing mandatory data in stages
system exceptions
these exceptions will occur based on the
internet is down or our bot needs
internet or any system failures
business exceptions
these exceptions are not really
exceptions they are based on the
business rules we are creating the
exceptions we need to fire manually
through the bot
what are work queues
our queue is a list that may be
configured internally to help a process
manage its workload
a process may use numerous work use and
work you may be shared by multiple
processes if
necessary work queues are created and
configured in the workflow area of
system manager this is where work use
can be provided with a name and a key
name
the key name directly correlates to a
column name in the collection stage used
within a process to add new items to a
work queue
explain the stages in process studio
decision stage
decision stage have two branches coming
out of them enabling a process to split
into two separate paths they are used to
evaluate the result of an expression as
either true or false
in blue prism these outcomes are known
as flags
calculation stage
calculation stage use expressions to
calculate values
these can be numerical or made using
values such as text dates
etc they are dependent on data items to
store results and can work with data
items to perform calculations
data items
data item acts as a placeholder for
values such as numbers text and dates
they can give a meaningful names like
user name email id and employed around
the process diagram data item is like a
variable
explain process validation
the validation button opens the process
validation window for diagnosing issues
the validation window categorizes issues
as errors warning and advice it
identifies the type of action that
should be taken to resolve them and
whether they are repairable by blue
prism
validation checks the basic construction
of process diagram but it is not capable
of analyzing the logic the
responsibility is always on the user
explain collections and loops in blue
prism
collection stage provides process
diagram the ability to hold multiple
values together
the values stored within the collection
states are accessed one row at a time
using a loop stage to move forward
through the rows
loop stages is divided into two parts
loop start and loop end
explain business objects
the purpose of business object is to
provide an interface to capture the
functionality of an application
business objects are used as a part of
process solution and can be thought of
as a separate layer of process the tasks
within a business objects are separated
out in different pages known as actions
each action relates to a particular
interaction with an application and a
process will use whichever of this
action it requires in any order to
perform a specific task within the
application
explain the difference between process
and object studio
in process studio the development tool
creates a diagram that resembles a flow
diagram
object studio creates objects
graphically by the development tool
proso studio has alert stage only object
studio has read write navigate code and
wait stage
process studio consists of main page
only
object studio consists of initialize and
cleanup page
resource studio interacts with the
object studio and control room object
studio interacts with external
applications
launch an application modeler is not
available in process studio but whereas
in object studio it is available
explain throttles and unconditional
weights in blue prism
weight stages can be used without any
conditions with the timeout serving as a
pause to delay the flow through the
diagram this is referred as throttling
throttling allows some extra time to
accommodate the variable performance
speed of an application
it is best practice to include
throttling at the beginning of every
action page that interacts within the
application
explain the input and output parameters
in blueprism
input and output parameters are used to
transmit values between the process
diagram and the business object action
business objects any value that is
required to input into the elements of
an application should be passed down
from a process via an input parameter
the business object should only retain
the information passed down to it for as
long as it takes to complete the
interaction
end stage on the lower page can use
output parameters to transmit a value up
to a page reference stage on an upper
page
now let us look at some of the advanced
level blue prism interview questions
what is a scheduler and how to configure
it
the blue prism tool allows to execute
process at a specified times and repeat
their execution at different intervals
it is termed as scheduler
the blue prism tool allows you to run
process at specific times and repeat
them at different intervals this is
known as scheduler
configure scheduler in the system tab by
clicking on the scheduler option
after we configure the scheduler we need
to click on the check box to activate it
explain release manager in blue prism
blueprism release manager enables users
to compile all of the components of a
blue prism solution into a package
including processes business objects and
work use and schedules calendars tiles
and dashboards
to export a solution package a release
must be created by right clicking
package overview and selecting new
package
a release is a snapshot of a state of
each of the components within a package
at a particular moment in time
how to create object in object studio
here are the steps to create object in
object studio
launch the blue prism software and open
the studio tab
right click on the objects and select
create object
then enter a name for new business
object enter the description which is
optional and finally it will create an
object in objects list
so let's jump into blueprism software
and create object
so after launching the blue prism
software
go to studio
go to objects
right click objects and click on create
object
enter the name of the object
so i'll enter object demo
after entering the name click on next
and enter the description which is
optional
and click on finish
and here you can see the object is
created in the object list
that is how you create an object in the
object studio
explain the concept of exceptional
bubbling
since exceptions can occur at any point
throughout a process solution whenever
an exception occurs it will always move
up towards the main page of the process
to the highest layer of the process
solution
an exception will continue to bubble up
from an action in business object and
then through the hierarchy of pages
within the calling process until it
reaches the page that contains a
recovery logic
at this point the exception will be
handled
if the main page of the highest layer of
the process solution does not have logic
to handle the error then an error
message window will appear when running
in process studio
the same error occurs when running a
process in control room the process will
terminate
how to import vbo in blue prism
the first step is
go to blue prism studio and click on
file and click on import
then the import release dialog box opens
click on browse
navigate to program files in c drive
in program files go to blue prism
limited
then to blue prism automate and open
vbevo
from there you can double click and
select the object
demonstrate the working of an email
automation in blue prism
first we'll create a new process
then we'll perform some of the actions
in which we will use action stage data
item and collection stage then after
performing all the required actions
finally we will go to our mail inbox and
check if we have received the mail
so we will jump into blue prism software
and see how to import and bbo in blue
prism
and
see the working of email automation in
blue prism
let's go to studio
the very first step is to import email
pop3 smdp business object to import that
go to file
go to import
process object
and go to browse
you have to go to the folder where blue
prism software is installed in my device
it's installed in c go to local disk c
go to program files
and go to blue prism limited
blue prism automate here scroll down
and go to vbo business objects
and here you can see
email pop3 smtp
select click on open select this
and click on open
and click on next
click on next
click on next
so when you're done with this the email
pop3 smtp will be imported
the next thing is
create a new process so
select process go to create new process
and let's name the process
we'll name the process as
email automation
click on next
enter a description of this process if
you want so that if some other user
opens the file he should know that what
is the process about
so enter the description it's optional
so we'll click on finish
and let's open this process now
the very first step is
to drag and drop and action
so select action and drop it here
open this action
so in first step we will set up the
email of the smtp
business object so we'll name it as name
this action as setup
select the business object as email pop3
smtp
and the action
is configure we are configuring it
and here we have to enter the username
password
of the server details
so from where do we get the server
details
to get the server details we have to go
to the browser
go to the browser and
search as gmail
server configuration
here you see
you will get the
all the details here the port number
the email
so in the smtp server we'll enter the
smtp.gmail.com and the port number as
587 and in the pop3 we will enter pop
gmail.com and port number as 995
and both the servers will turn it on
to turn it on we'll write it as true
so we'll go back to the
blue prism
so enter the server
pop.gmail.com enter it in the double
quotes
an smtp server
enter as smtp
dot gmail.com
and the pop report number is
995
and the smtp port number is
587
and pop use ssl should turn it on to
turn it on we need to enter the value as
true
okay now we should enter the username
and password
i enter the password here
for example if i enter the password here
the password is visible
we don't want the password to be visible
the password should be encrypted
so for the password to be encrypted in
data item there is an option called
passwording data types
so go to data item
drag and drop a data item
and select the data type as password
and enter the password here here the
password will be encrypted
and click on ok
we'll name the data item as password
similarly we will use another data item
for username
name the data item as username
select the data type as
text
and give the initial value
so
enter your email id
and click on ok
so now we have username and password
now go to the setup
and select the username and password
drag and drop this username
and in the password
drag and drop the password
so so the setup is done
the next step is
the next step is we want to enter the
subject and the data in the mail
right for that we need to
use another action item
drag and drop another action
name it as
sending message
select the business object as email pop
sm
tp
and go to action and in the action
select the action as send message
here you need to enter the
email id to whom you want to send so
i'll enter the email id which we had
entered in the username
enter both the from and to email ids so
i'll use the same email id
since this is just for demo i'm using
the same email id so enter the
subject subject i'll enter it as
demo
and enter the body
hello
so now that we have entered the subject
and body
let's close this
and now let us
now use the link
and connect it
now let us click on run and check
whether we have received the email
oops there is an error
we have missed something
oh we have missed a double quote
let us save again
reset and run
so the process is completed
let us go to the email inbox and check
whether we have received the email
so let me refresh
and here we go
we have received the email
as hello and the
subject is demo
so we have received the email now let us
send it with an attachment so for that
we go to the blue prism
to go to sending message here
here you can see attachment
attachment is of the data type
collection
right
so for that we need to use a collection
item so drag and drop a collection
go to collections
and
click on import
select the business object as email
and select the action as
send message
and the parameter with attachments
select the attachment and click on
ok next go to initial value
in initial value click on add
you can add multiple path here
and attach how many other attachments
you want
for now we'll attach only one attachment
so you need to provide the file path
here
so we'll go to the desktop
so i have this article on desktop so
i'll attach this article in the email
so
select this article
shift and right click
and
copy as path
copy this path go back to blue prism
and provide the path here
remove the double quotes
and click on ok
so once the collection item is completed
go back to sending message
go to collections
here in the collection
select this
and click on ok
click on reset
and let us run
and here you go you can see the process
is completed
so let us go to the email inbox and
check if we have received an email with
an attachment
so here we go
we have received the email with the
attachment
let us open it
the same email with the subject demo
and the body as hello and with the
article which i had attached rpa
projects
so i have received the
attachment
so with that we have reached the end of
this video that was all about the demo
on email automation if you have any

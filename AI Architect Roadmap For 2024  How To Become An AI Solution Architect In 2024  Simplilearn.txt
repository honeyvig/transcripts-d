I am mayank and welcome to this amazing
video on how to become an AI solution
Architect by simply learn but before we
begin if you enjoy watching these type
of videos and find them interesting
subscribe to our YouTube channel as we
bring you the best videos daily also hit
the Bell icon to never miss any update
from Simply learn so let's get started
in the dynamic field of artificial
intelligence the role of AI solution
architect has emerged as a critical and
soft after position insufficient
planning unsuitable architecture and
inability to scale are common causes of
failure of AI projects these AI
professional with the gap between
Cutting Edge AI technology and real
world business challenges crafting
Innovative solution that drives success
organization are always look out for the
AI architecture to Aid in the formation
of architectural strategy the
development of operation and the
identification of the tools and feature
in this video we will discuss what it
takes to become an AI solution architect
their duties how much they earn and how
they vary from those of an AI engineer
before we move on to what an air
solution architect is if you are an
aspiring AIML engineer then there is no
better time to train yourself in the
exciting field of AI if you are looking
for a course that covers everything from
the fundamental to Advanced Techniques

enroll now and unlock exciting AIML
opportunities the link is in the
description box below so without any
further Ado let's get started so what is
an AI solution architect AI solution
architect work in the field of
Information Technology to develop and
Implement infrastructure for application
databases and computer network when it
comes to governing and scaling AI effort
they serve as the connecting tissue
between data analysts database
administrator programmers operators and
business unit Executives so moving
forward let's see AI engineer versus AI
solution architect a engineer use
machine learning and neural network for
business AI models they require skills
in software engineering data science and
programming a architect create Advanced
AI infrastructure empathizing with
customer needs to provide solution every
AI Focus Enterprise needs and architect
skills in data analysis AI framework and
infrastructure moving forward let's see
some AI architect responsibilities AI
architect encompasses various
responsibility critical for Designing
and implementing successful artificial
intelligence solution the first one is
system design getting the overall
Architects for AI System including
selecting appropriate Technologies
framework and infrastructure to support
AI models and application the second one
is algorithm selection and development
choosing the right machine learning or
deep learning algorithms and developing
custom algorithms when necessary to
address specific business challenges the
third one is data strategy overseeing
data collection storage pre-processing
and integration to ensure data quality
accessibility and availability for AI
model training and interface
scalability and performance designing AI
system to scale effectively as a data
volumes grow and continuously optimizing
AI models for improved AI accuracy and
efficiency the fifth one is integration
and collaboration collaborating with
cross-functional teams such as data
scientists engineers and business
stakeholders to integrate AI Solutions
seemingly into existing workflows and
align them with organizational objective
so moving forward let's see AI
architecture skills because AI may be
used in such a wide variety of context
and deployed in so many different ways
architects of AI system need to possess
a diversified set of skills that are the
first one are technical skills you need
to be acquainted with the following
technical abilities if you want to have
a successive career as an AI architect
the first one is processes and system
understanding of the processes and
systems that make you of machine
learning and deep learning pipeline the
second one is Mastery of ML and learning
Frameworks like tensorflow and ml
methodologies the third one is
familiarity with sophisticated analytics
tools like scsr and python the fourth
one is awareness of Applied Mathematics
such as neural networks and random
forces technical expertise is necessary
but it is not enough you need to be well
versed in these soft skill so first one
is thought leadership AI Architects
should drive an AI Centric culture
transformation and provide realistic
insights of AI limitation for digital
thought data the second word is
collaborative mindset AI architect
collaborate with various teams and
leaders to ensure AI platform align with
business and Technical goals after
covering AI solution architect skills
let's move forward and see AI architect
salary so there is a possibility that
the salary will very depend on the
company as well as the level of
knowledge and experience that you bring
with you top companies like Nvidia for
Amazon and many more are hiring AI
solution architect in the U.S according
to Glassdoor the average salary for an
AI solution architect is 188 000

scored the after attention of the major
industry players with renowned companies
such as Wipro Unilever and Infosys and
others actively seeking to these
professionals to add their in their
teams according to Glasgow the national
average salary for an AI solution
architect is 34 lakh per annum annually
in India in conclusion embracing AI
isn't just such Choice it's a strategy
decision that can reshape how your
organization approach machine learning

technology has advanced significantly in
recent years and is having a significant
impact on careers all of those
technologies evolved through the
development of new softwares and
products that involve a significant
amount of coding and programming
coding and programming languages aid in
development of softwares and products
c sharp and c plus are examples of such
languages
c plus plus is an object-oriented
programming language whereas c sharp is
a component oriented programming
language
c cluster development must comply to a
specific architecture or be portable but
c sharp development must be a simple
modern general purpose
object oriented programming language
on that note hey everyone i am pepper
khandelwal and i welcome you all to yet
another exciting video from simply learn
in this session we will be discussing c
sharp versus c plus plus
however before we begin make sure you
have subscribed to our youtube channel
and clicked on the bell icon below so
you never miss an update from simply
learn's youtube channel let's look at
the agenda for today's topic
we shall begin a session by discussing
what is c hash language
then we will discuss what is c plus plus
language
after that we will dive into differences
between c sharp and c plus plus language
finally we will include this session
with some more key differences between c
sharp and c plus plus
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is c hash or c sharp
language
c hash is an object oriented programming
language
developed by microsoft that runs on the
dot-net framework
its features include strong typing
imperative declarative object oriented
and component oriented programming
c sharp was created by microsoft under
the direction of anders heiselberg and
his team
now let's discuss what is c plus plus
language
c plus is also a general purpose
programming language c plus plus
supports seven styles of programming
like functional programming structure
programming or object-oriented
programming
it is also used in creating operating
systems browsers and games etc
we now have a brief idea of what c sharp
and c plus plus is
now let's discuss differences between c
sharp and c plus plus
we will discuss these differences based
on various parameters let's start with
memory management
memory management in c sharp is handled
automatically by garbage collector if a
programmer constructs an object and that
object's duty is completed then the
garbage collector will immediately trash
that object
memory management in c plus is done
manually by programmer if a programmer
creates an object he is responsible for
destroying that object after that
object's job is completed
next up platform dependency
c-sharp code is only compatible with
windows although microsoft is attempting
to make it worldwide
significant systems do not support c
sharp get
c plus plus code is portable and can run
on any platform c plus plus is also used
when a program needs to connect directly
with hardware
next up multiple inheritance
c hash does not support any multiple
inheritance through classes
multiple inheritance is supported in c
plus through classes this means that a
class may extend many classes at the
same time
next up bound checking
it's the compiler that does error bound
checking in c sharp
if the programmer attempts to access an
invalid array index by accident it will
result in a compilation error
the compiler does not perform bound
checking for c plus if a programmer
accidentally attempts to access an
invalid error index the output will be
incorrect but no compiler fault will be
shown
next up pointers uses
in c sharp a pointer can be used in
unsafe mode by default c sharp does not
support pointer arithmetic however we
can construct an unsafe environment in
which pointers can be accessed by using
the unsafe keyword
on the contrary pointers in c plus can
be used anywhere in the program
next up language type
c sharp is an high level object oriented
programming language
while c plus plus is a low level
object-oriented programming language
after that let's discuss the level of
difficulty
there are no complex features in c sharp
it has a simple hierarchy that is
straightforward to understand
it has a rich set of library functions
and data types at structure
c plus is a programming language with
many more complex features like dynamic
memory allocation
etc
now next application type
c shop language is used to develop
various applications like mobile windows
and console application
on the other hand c plus language is
typically used to develop only the
console application
next up compilation result
compilation a c hash code is translated
into an intermediate language code using
jit in asp.net
as for c plus after compilation it is
converted into machine code using a c
plus plus compiler
next up
object oriented
c sharp is pure object-oriented
programming language
thanks to the.net framework it is
strengthened by encapsulation
polymorphism and inheritance
whereas c plus plus is not a pure object
oriented programming language
due to the primitive data types
next up access specifier
access specifier in c-sharp includes
public private protected internal and
protected internal
on contrary c plus plus access
clarifiers includes public private and
protected it lacks internal and
protected internal access modifiers
next let's discuss types of project we
can do with these languages
c-sharp language is majorly used to
develop modern applications like twitter
bot atms and driving simulators etc
whereas the c plus program are typically
used for application that interact
directly with the hardware or require
higher performance than other languages
can provide
at last size of binaries
the c sharp is a programming language
that has lots of overhead and libraries
must be included before it is compiled
on the other hand c plus has much more
lightweight binaries
finally let's look at the conclusion for
this session
first up
c plus plus language is a low level
programming language
that extends the base c language with
object-oriented programming capabilities
whereas c-sharp is a high-level language
next up c plus plus code is compiled to
machine code whereas c-sharp code is
compiled to clr that is common language
runtime which is then interpreted by jit
in asp.net
finally the memory management in c plus
is done manually whereas in c-sharp the
virtual machine takes care of it
automatically

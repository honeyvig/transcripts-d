hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this particular
session we will discuss the differences
between the two major data structures
that are the arrays and linked lists but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you are a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
so at first we will discuss what exactly
is an array data structure
followed by that we will understand the
linked list data structure then we will
understand the types of iras and after
that we will understand the types of
linked lists and finally
we will learn the fundamental
differences between arrays and linked
lists so i hope i made myself clear with
the agenda now let's get started with
our first topic
so at first what exactly is an array so
an array is a linear data structure that
stores homogeneous data elements in a
continuous form
so homogeneous in the sense you will be
able to store only one single data type
of elements in an array for example
consider that you have declared an array
and you wanted to store some elements in
the array so you can declare a data type
first after that the name of the array
and if you declared that the array
should store in teacher data type then
you can only store integer elements in
that particular data type you cannot
store any other data type like float or
character that is the meaning of this
particular definition and it stores the
elements in a continuous order that is
in the adjacent format as you can see in
the example here 10 20 30 40 and which
are located in the adjacent locations
that is 0 1 2 and 3. now let us
understand what exactly is a linked list
so similar to array even a linked list
is a linear data structure but the only
difference is it is a dynamic data
structure here you can increase or
decrease the size of the linked list in
runtime
the only difference is here the memory
locations are not adjacent to each other
but they are taken from the memory heap
so there is a huge memory chunk out of
that the linked list will borrow some of
the memory locations and one after the
other the memory nodes will be
interconnected using pointers
so that was the difference between array
and linked list and similar to arrays
even the linked list store homogeneous
type of elements that is if you declare
a linked list of float data type then
you can only store float data type in it
you cannot store any other different
data type like character or string
now followed by that let us understand
the types of arrays
so basically we have three different
types of arrays those are the
one-dimensional arrays and inside
multi-dimensional arrays we find two
more types those are the two dimensional
arrays and three dimensional arrays now
one dimensional arrays will be having
only one subscript that is where they'll
be having only one single row whereas in
the two dimensional arrays we will be
having two subscripts that is it will be
having rows and columns
and in the three dimensional arrays it
will be having three subscripts that is
the row column and the block address now
followed by the types of arrays we will
understand the types of linked lists
so similar to arrays even linked lists
are divided into three types they are
singly linked list doubly linked list
and circular linked list the difference
between them is a singly linked list
will have two parts that is the node
address and node element in this
particular segment the element will be
stored and in this particular second
segment the address that points to the
next node will be saved and similarly in
the circular linked list the only
difference between the singly linked
list and the circular linked list is at
the end of the single lining list we can
see a null pointer which indicates the
end of the linked list but in circular
linked list the address will not be null
instead it will point back to the head
node that is what which makes it as a
circular typed singly linked list or a
circular linked list
when it comes to the third type that is
the doubly linked list
we can see there are two address
locations the first starting node will
have null as its first address location
then we'll store the element and the
second address location will point to
the next node and you can see in the
second node we'll have element and the
first address location will point to the
previous node and the second address
location will point to the next node and
at the end the second address location
will be pointed as null which indicates
as the
end of the linked list
now that we know the types of linked
lists and arrays we will look into the
fundamental differences between arrays
and linked lists
so the first fundamental differences
between the arrays and linked list is
the array element can be accessed
randomly using just the index values but
whereas random access is not possible in
linked list if you want to access any
element in linked list you need to
perform the traverse operation
sequentially
the second difference between the both
is
array is static which means memory size
is fixed which cannot be changed in
runtime but whereas in the linked list
the memory is dynamic which means you
can either shrink or expand the memory
in runtime according to your
requirements
followed by that the next difference is
each element in array is independent in
nature that is you can access any
element just by giving the index
location whereas in linked list the
elements are interdependent on each
other whenever you want to access a
specific element you need to go through
the other elements or traverse through
the other elements
next one is the array takes more time in
operations like insertion and deletion
whereas linked list takes less time to
perform the operations of insertion and
deletion followed by that the next
difference is accessing any element is
faster in array as random access is
possible and the array data structure
just by using its index values but
whereas accessing an element in linked
list is slow because we know that we
need to traverse through all the node
elements to access a particular element
now the next difference is in case of an
array memory allocation is done in
compile time whereas in linked list the
memory allocation is done during the
runtime
memory utilization is inefficient in an
array as it is allocated as in static
and it is allocated during the compile
time in case of linked list the memory
utilization is very efficient as the
memory is allocated during the runtime
now with that we have come to an end of
this tutorial where we have discussed
what is an array and what is the linked
list they are types and the fundamental
differences between the book if you have
any queries regarding the topics covered
in the session or if you feel that we
have missed out on something please let
us know in the comment section below and
we will be happy to receive all your
comments and will be happy to solve all
your queries until next time thank you
stay safe and keep vlogging

so this is my default this is what I
always do it's a little performance
trick if you like the fresh car smell I
want to switch over to a different
project notice how how when I open it up
here all the files that were opened
before are now open again and in my
solution Explorer I can see that all my
folders and projects have all been
expanded to the same levels that they
were last time I used this project and
that's all good that means that I can
get right back into where I left off but
very often this is not what I want very
often I come in I open the project in
the morning to start working on on
something and I don't want sort of
yesterday's state to be expanded into
Visual Studio I want something clean I
want something fresh I want that fresh
car smell none of this open but I want
to be able to open my my app and work
with it so I'm going to show you a
couple of settings that are really
really helpful so if you go to tools
options and then go to projects and
solutions so reopen documents on
solution load I'm going to uncheck that
and restore solution Explorer project
Key State on solution load I'm going to
uncheck that as well so now let's open
this project again that we had before
I'm going to switch again and first of
all I don't know if you notice this but
it's instant the loading of these
projects are now instant because no
other files have to be opened no state
had to be read from disk and hydrated
into memory on the UI thread in Visual
Studio to expand all the tree notes in
solution Explorer none of that was
necessary when you open a file let's say
you open a c-sharp file if it's the
first time you open a c-sharp file in
that instance of Visual Studio that
you've got open then it has to boot up
all of Rosslyn and everything to get
intellisense and colorization and all
that working and that's called a
language service and a language service
can sometimes take a little while to
load it's not necessarily a long time
but it's not instant

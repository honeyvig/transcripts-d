machine learning's major purpose is to
train models and anticipate outcomes
that may be used by applications
scripts are used in azure machine
learning to train models using machine
learning frameworks
that enable us to quickly operationalize
diverse machine learning jobs and
iterative processes
by leveraging microsoft azure's massive
computational power
but knowing this much is not enough and
therefore here we are
so hello everyone welcome to this new
video of simply learn on azure machine
learning
in this video we'll go through azure
machine learning in detail including its
capabilities the azure ecosystem that
supports machine learning
and the various ways we train and build
models
starting with
what is azure machine learning followed
by who is machine learning for
then we will look into its
infrastructure readiness and security
then we will dive into machine learning
project workflow
following that we will understand ml ops
devops for machine learning and at last
we will explore the azure machine
learning studio
after that we will have a demo too
so without doing any further delay let's
start with the video
so what is azure machine learning
azure machine learning is a cloud
solution that helps you speed up and
manage your machine learning projects it
can be used by machine learning
specialists data scientists and
engineers in the daily workflows
models are trained and deployed and
mlops are managed
you can use an open source platform like
pytorch tensorflow or scikit-learn to
build a model or use one created in
azure machine learning
model monitoring retraining and
redeployment are all made easier using
these tools
but this brings us to a question
that who exactly machine learning is for
so individuals and teams deploying mlops
inside their company can use azure
machine learning to move machine
learning models into production in a
safe and auditable environment
data scientist and machine learning
experts will find tools to help them
speed up and automate their daily tasks
tools for embedding models into
applications or services will be
available to application developers
platform developers will find a strong
set of tools for constructing advanced
ml technology
underpinned by resilient as as all
resource manager apis
now that we know the basics of azure ml
let's have a look at its infrastructure
readiness and security
so azure machine learning is an azure
cloud platform that adds security
to machine learning projects
so integrations for security include the
following
network security groups in azure virtual
networks
azure keyword is a world where you may
store security secrets like storage
account access details
and set up an azure container registry
behind the v-net
so now let's dive down deep and explore
its project workflow
models are usually created as part of
project with a specific goal and
objective multiple people are usually
involved in these projects iterative
development is used while experimenting
with data algorithms
and models
now coming to the project life
cycle while the project lifespan will
differ depending on the project it will
typically look like this
a workspeed space organizes a project
and facilitate collaboration among
multiple users who are all working
toward the same goal
users in a workspace may easily share
the result of the experiments through
the studio user interface
or they can use versioned assets for
jobs like environments and storage
references
so users work can be automated in a
machine learning pipeline and activated
on a timetable or https request when a
project is ready for operation
therefore
models can be deployed to the manage
interferencing
solution in real time or batch
abstracting away the infrastructure
management that is traditionally
necessary for model deployment
now let's proceed further and understand
the concept of mlops that is
devops for machine learning
mlops or devops for machine learning is
a process for generating models for
production use
if not
reproducible the lifetime of a model
from training to deployment must be
auditable
mlops or machine learning operations is
based on devops principles
and methods to improve workflow
efficiency
continuous integration delivery and
deployment for example
these ideas are applied to the machine
learning process by mlops with the
purpose of experimentation and model
deployment can be done more quickly and
quality assurance and end-to-end lineage
tracking are more efficient ways to put
models into production
now
let's explore what is azure ml studio
so azure machine learning studio is an
online service that includes low code
and no code alternators for project
development and asset management in
azure machine learning
basically it is a workspace where you
can create build train the machine
learning models
for an inclusive data science platform
the studio integrates no code and no
code first experience
so now that we have covered all the
important concepts of azure machine
learning
let's have a demo for a better
understanding of how machine learning is
used in azure
so let's start with the demo first you
need to browse the link
studio.azureml.net
and here you need to log in with your
azure account
so once you have logged in you will be
led to a new window
this is your window here you can see a
few options
so
let's start
and see one by one what these options
are
so the first one is projects
basically this gives you a list of all
the experiments that you have already
worked on so here you can see we haven't
worked on any experiment yet
then comes uh experiment
experiments are all the programs and
codes that you have worked on to create
it or deploy a model that you've just
created for an experiment
so as i said we haven't created any
experiment yet so the list is
null over here
when you click on samples you can see a
few
sample experiments provided to you by
azure
portal by default
and
following that we have web services
so we all know since azure is a cloud
computing platform so all the data
gathered from our experiments needs to
be uploaded to the cloud
so web services gives you a list of all
the experiments that you have in the
cloud so you can access them from
anywhere
so uh
when you create an experiment and work
on it when you add it to the cloud the
data is stored here
so then comes data sets
it gives you all the data sets you have
in your azure portal when you click on
the samples option
again you can see all this data sets
provided to you
by default in your azure portal
then comes train models
so while working on an experiment you
will come across a point where you need
to train your model
so basically this gives you a list of
all the models that you have trained in
experiments or azure programs
and in the last come settings
any changes that you want to make to
your workspace is done under settings
here you can see
this is your workspace name workspace
description which is by default
and all the details is provided
here only so whatever changes you want
to make your workspace
you will be doing this over here
so now let's start with a demo
so down below you can see the add or new
option here
so click on it
and then you can see there are a few way
uh templates provided by you
provided to you by azure itself so we'll
click on blank experiment
once you click on the blank experiments
uh you'll be guided to a new experiment
window
so this is the new window and this
window is divided into three parts
these are the components
where you will plan your model
this is the canvas to design your model
and then the properties of the model
in the components section you can see
samples already present there so you can
select any one of them according to your
requirement
so here when i'm typing samples
uh
i'll work on airport quotes datasets so
i just need to drag this option over
here
but before starting
with our experiment let's change the
name
so here i'm changing it to
airport
codes
demo model
so now you can see the name of the
experiment is changed
now when you click on it
and
select visualize
just a second
you can see the number of rows and
columns provided to it the data which is
required
for its data set to be created and for
its model to be created
so the four rows who columns are airport
id
city state and name
now
we will move towards the part where we
define field we need to make a
predictions for
so type columns in the search
bar
uh under manipulation
section
you can
see there are multiple options provided
to you
so here we will select
select columns and data sets
as we are working on data sets
now connect your data set with this
option
so you can see a red alert over here
so
when you click on it
you can see it is asking for values in
your data set so to add values
click on the launch column selector
under properties
section
so once you click on it here you need to
select all the options
needed per required values so for my
experiment model i need all these data
sets so i'll add
all of these and then click on the save
option
so let me just add this
now i have saved
all the
values i need in our in my data set
so now
you can see the alert is
gone
so now we have the data sets that we
want to work on so let's look for an
appropriate algorithm for it
so
while looking into the classification
algorithm
we
know that our
so here you can see it under
classification model we have
these options
so we know that our target value is
divided into two classifications so the
algorithm we will be using
is a
two class
so we will be using two class booster
decision tree
because it calculates the accuracy for
every mode and once the calculated
accuracy is more than a required
accuracy then only it moves to the next
node
so basically this gives you a prediction
value close to the accurate value of the
model
so we will just drag this option over
here
so now the next step we have is to train
our model
so we just need to type train over here
and select train model option
so
just
drag it to the canvas
now connect the two booster decision
tree to the train model
now you can again see the red alert for
required
data as it doesn't have any data to work
on so our next step is to
split the data
so we'll type split
and drag display data option on our
canvas
as you can see this is also
saying
it needs an input port data set so we'll
connect a data set
with it so
that it is provided with the
data
so when you click on it you can see it
it is asking for a split percentage
so you split the data into training and
testing where 80 goes to training and 20
to testing so we will mention 0.08 over
here
and
so
now we will just connect the 80 data to
the train model
as we
said the 80 goes for training
but you can still see the alert in the
train model because it is not aware of
the column
it needs to train on
so we will click on
column selector
now you just need to select all the
columns
you need to work on so i'm selecting the
airport id number
now you can see
once i save it
that the alert is gone
now our next step is to find the score
of a model so let's type score
in our search bar
and drag the score model over
here
let me just reduce the size of the
canvas yeah
so we will just connect our train model
to the score model
so again you will see the red alert as
it doesn't know the data it needs to
test on so for that we will connect the
remaining testing data in the split data
option to the
score model
now you can see the alert option is gone
now coming to the final step that is
evaluation of the model so let's type
evaluation
and here you can see the evaluate model
option you just need to drag it to the
canvas
so
let's
connect it with our score model
now your model for the app port code
data set is complete so this is the
whole
model
now you need to save the model and then
click on run option
so here i have saved it
and you can see it's running
you can see the model running and going
through every node
as you can see the green mark
as it's verifying through every node
so once it's done click on evaluate
model
and
then click on visualize
now you can see the accuracy is a
98.
you know you can see the accuracy is 98
which is almost the prediction value now
you can see the positive and negative
labels as well
so this whole data is known as confusion
matrix
now for the values close to the pos
positive label it gives me the number of
true predictions
that uh the number of data i'll provide
it will it shows that
72 predictions will be right and one
will be
wrong
now let's go back and
run this model over the web
so by clicking on uh setup web service
we will click on predictive web service
now we will just connect web service
input to the score model
so that once the program is uploaded to
the cloud it is directly connected to
the score model
and gives us the
output
so now you need to save this
and
run
this will execute the entire model
now
all uh we are
left with is deploying the model
now
we just need to click
on deploy web service
so then you will see you will be taken
to a new window
here you can
see
the response page where it's showing
test option you need to click on it
so here you can see a new window has
popped up so you just need to mention
the details like for city i am
mentioning bangalore
for state i am mentioning karnataka
our name of the airport is
campagoda
international
airport
and i just need to save this data
so now down below you can see it gives
me predictive values
and this is the airport id
for my mentioned details so the accuracy
of this id will be 0.98 which is 98
percent
which is almost accurate to 100 percent
so this was our experiment and this is
how we can use ml in azure thank you
well this was all about azure machine
learning i hope you find this with your

hi guys this is harsh padraig from
simply learn and welcome to this
tutorial on c plus plus basics so let's
jump in and see what's in it for us
so we will be covering today the basics
of c plus plus that is we will learn how
to write your first program in c plus
plus then types and variables in c plus
plus after that topics like arrays
strings efl statements for loop while
loop and functions
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's start with the introduction to
c plus plus programming
c plus plus is a popular programming
language introduced by john strawstrom
in the year 1979. the aim was to make a
dynamic language that is efficient and
has some additional features to see
initially it was called c with classes
as it was an extension to c language but
later renamed as c plus plus
it is general purpose case sensitive
language and it is called pre-compiled
language because it converts the source
code directly to the machine
understandable code
it is an intermediate level language
because it contains both features of
high level and low level language
c
supports the features of object oriented
language like encapsulation inheritance
polymorphism etc it also supports
procedural programming and functional
programming as well
now as we have understood about c plus
plus programming
let's move on to our first program in c
plus
so the first program for beginners is
hello world program
in this program hello world is printed
it is very basic program and in the
first part of the program we are
including a header file hash include
iostream
header files are generally used to
import features into the program
functions like c in which is used to
take the input from the user and c out
which is used to display the output are
defined in this iopin header file
here using namespace standard means
we are using all the things which are
within the standard library
the second part of the program is main
function
this is a special function from where
the execution of program starts
inside the main function we are printing
hello world using the c out which is
used to print the output
return 0 on the next line will indicate
the program that nothing will return and
program executed successfully
so let's try this hello world program on
our code editor that is vs code
so let's first of all name the file
hello.cpp
so first of all we'll include the header
files
hash include iostream
and then namespace standard we'll write
using namespace
std
now we'll write the main function that
is int main
now inside this function
we'll print using
c out
and
we'll write
hello
world
after that we'll write return 0
all right now let's try to run this
as you can see hello world is getting
printed over here
so this is how it's done
so now let's move to our next topic
that is types and variables
coming to types and variables
in c plus there are different types of
data type that acts as a keyword which
is responsible to define a variable
first is boolean data type
this keyword is used when we have two
values either true or false and these
values are used when there are
conditions for example if the condition
is satisfied then it's true otherwise it
will return false
next is character data type
this character data type is used when we
are dealing with alphabets and symbols
and it is used to hold a single
character within the variable
integer data type
this data type is used for integer
values they can be both positive and
negative
next is flow data type
float is used when we want to store
values that are in decimal form
now variables
variables are used with these data types
it is generally used to store values
and this is the syntax to define a
variable
first we will mention the data type and
then the variable name of our choice
for example int is the data type and
data is the variable name
moving to arrays
errors are one of the most important and
widely used concepts in c plus plus it
can be defined as a collection of
similar kind of elements the elements of
array are stored in contiguous memory
locations that is one after the other
arrays make it possible to store
multiple values of the same data type
into a single variable
the syntax to declare an array is first
we will mention the data type then the
array name and after that number of
elements inside the brackets
our next topic is strings
we can define strings as a collection or
group of characters
it is basically used to represent text
in the program
and we can perform many operations on
strings in order to manipulate it
the syntax of string contains a
collection of characters surrounded by
double quotes for example here string is
the type
str is the name of the string and coffee
is the value that is assigned to the
string
in c plus there are two ways to create a
string
first is c style strings
in c style strings collection of
characters are stored in the form of
arrays
they are basically areas of type
character
the second way is using string objects
we can create string object to hold a
string
they are implemented in the standard
library which we must include in the
program using hash include
next is if false statements
if else are two conditional statements
that are generally used when we want to
run the code based on some conditions
we run a block of code which is inside
if statement only if the condition is
true for example
if the number variable here is equal to
10
then only the block of code will execute
and will print the message you got it
otherwise it will run the else block and
display the message written inside that
block which is not this one
now coming to loops
first is for loop
for loop is the repetition control
structure
that allows us to repeat a block of code
for a fixed number of times
instead of repeating the same code again
and again
the syntax of for loop has three parts
first is initialization it is used to
initialize the loop
next is condition which is used to
determine when to end the loop and last
is updation which is used to update the
loop variables
for example inside the loop i equal to 0
means we have initialized the loop from
0 and i less than 10 means the loop will
keep on repeating until i becomes less
than 10
that is it will repeat for 10 times in
total from 0 to 9 and i plus plus
denotes that we are incrementing the
loop after each iteration by 1.
another type of loop is while loop
while loop are used in c plus when we
don't know the exact number of times the
loop should repeat
it repeats the statements till the given
condition is true the syntax for while
loop is while keyword and condition in
the brackets
and the loop will iterate till that
condition is true
and once the condition becomes false
then the control passes outside the loop
for example in this while loop the
condition is number less than 10
that means the loop will keep nitrating
till the number is less than 10
that is till when it becomes equal to 9
and inside the loop after printing the
variable number we are incrementing the
variable because we want to increment
the variable number after each iteration
now
moving on to functions
functions in c plus are group of
statements that are designed to perform
a specific task
it allows us to write a code inside the
function and then we can use that code
every time when we need it
by simply mocking the function
we can also pass arguments to the
function
the syntax of function is
type
function name
and then the parameters
inside the function brackets we can
write the code and we can invoke the
function by calling it from the main
function
so as we have understood these concepts
so let's move on to our code editor that
is vs code to do some examples on these
concepts
so here we will do an example
in which we will find the number of even
elements and odd elements using array
for loop and if file statements
so let's first of all
make a new file
let's name this file as
basic dot cpp
okay so first of all we'll include the
header files
now we'll write using namespace standard
now we will include int main
and
int main
and here we will declare an array
arr
and we'll write
and we'll mention the elements 2
7 let's say 12 and
9
okay
now
first of all we'll initialize the
variables let's say int even
0 and will initialize
odd variable
with 0 as well
now
we'll write int length
because we want to find
size of the array and for that we will
write
sizeof
arrayname
then
divide size of
array of
zero
so now i'll explain this part here we
have an array which has 5 integers and
since size of an integer is 4 bytes
therefore size of array is 5 into 4 that
is 20 bytes
now int length we have written int
length equals size of array divided by a
size of array of 0 that is 20 divided by
4
that is equal to 5
so 5 is the size
here size of array of 0 is the size of
element at index 0.
we can take any index here like arrow 1
array of 2 array of 3
so now we know the length of the array
so here we will include the for loop
and
we'll start with int i equals zero
we have initialized i with zero
now i less than
length
this one
here i have written i less than length
that is i less than 5
okay
now i plus plus we are incrementing it
now we have to
use if condition because we want to find
the even elements and the odd elements
and for that we have to include if
condition so we'll write if
array
of i
mod 2
that is
if
an element on
dividing by 2 gives 0 as a remainder
gives 0 as a remainder then it will it
is even element
so
we'll increment the even variable this
which we have initialized 0 will
increment over here
okay
so now
in else block
we'll write
odd plus plus
it means that if this condition is not
true then the odd variable will
increment
all right
now
we will
print the variables
so
we'll write
even numbers
and we are printing these outside the
follow so that they
don't repeat
with the for loop so that is why we have
printed these outside the for loop okay
now
we'll write the variable even
and l for the new line
similarly we'll write odd number
or numbers
the variable odd
and after that we'll write
return zero
okay so this is the code
so now let's try to run this one
there is some error
okay
yeah the spelling is wrong
okay let's try again
yeah here it is
as we can see
even numbers 2 or numbers 3
we can
check it
like even numbers 2
12.
there are two even numbers and 1 7 9
there are three odd numbers
so in this question we have
used array for loop and if else
so now let's try some other example
okay
let's name this as
basic 2
dot cbp
all right first of all we'll include the
header file
hash include i stream
now using namespace standard
okay now we will do an example in which
we will print the elements from 1 to 20
using while loop and with the help of
function
so first of all
we'll start with intermittent
and inside int main will simply
call or invoke the function
by writing the name of the function this
is the name of the function print
function
okay so here we are calling this
function and after that return 0 will
write
ok now we have to make this function
let's create
void
what is the data type print function
is the name
and inside this function
will first of all initialize i
the variable i with one
now will use while loop
and
we'll write the condition
i less than equal to 20
this means that the loop will keep on
repeating until i becomes less than
equal to 20
so basically it will
move from 1 to 20 times
in total the loop will repeat for 20
times
so now
all we have to do is
we'll just print the i variable
and
in order to give some space between each
element
while printing so that is why we have
used double quotes with the space
between them
now we'll
increment
i plus plus
so that i will increment after each
iteration
all right now
here we have called this function and it
is getting printed inside the function
itself so let's try to run this one
here we can see this is the output
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten
up to twenty
as i have told you
as you have put the condition less than
equal to 20 so that is why 20 is also
getting printed
because we have used equal to over here
so
we have called the function print
function and inside that function we
have initialized the variable i with 1
and we have put the condition i less
than equal to 20
so that is where the loop is getting
repeated for 20 times and i is getting
printed inside the loop and after that
we have used increment operator so that
the value of i gets updated everything
after every single iteration
so this is the output so now let's move
on to the next example
so
let's make a new file
and name it as basic three dot cpv
so here we will do an example of string
and we'll do some push back and pop back
operation on it
so first of all we'll include the header
file
hash include iostream
then using namespace standard
namespace standard okay
now
we'll start with int main
all right first of all we'll write
string
data type
then the name of the string
s
here s is the name of the string
all right now
first of all we'll display a message
to enter a string
so
okay enter a string
now
get line
this is the syntax when you want to take
the input
of a string
so
get line c in is used to take the input
and s is the name of the string
so this is how we take the input
and
now we will print another message saying
that
you have entered
now here we will print the string so
next line and then
okay
now
we'll do some operations like s dot
pushback
this will add an element at the end of
the string
so
let's say we want to add
y
so we'll write y inside the bracket
s dot push back and inside the bracket
with single quotes will write
y
now
we'll display a message saying
after
after using
pushback function
we'll print the string
that is after using the function push
back the string would look like this
and
now
we'll use another function s dot pop
back
it will delete the element from the end
so
we'll write c out
and we'll display the message
after using pop back function
let's write pop back only
and we'll print the
string
okay
now after that we'll write return zero
and i think it's done only the spelling
is wrong over here
okay
yeah now let's try to run this
as you can see the message enter a
string
so let's say i have entered
barcelona
so you have entered barcelona after
using pushback barcelona y
because we have used y
over here we want to add y at the end of
the string so after using pushback
barcelona y
and
pop back function after that we have
used and we know that it will delete the
element from the end so
here we can see there is no y pop by
function have deleted the element
so this is our output
and
these were some basic examples of c plus
basics it includes the
examples of array for loop if else
and functions strings we have covered
and there are some more examples on each
of these topics so i suggest you to
please practice them all
and that is how you will get a good
understanding on all of these topics
so
you can try some more examples on it
and alright guys with that we have come

hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn
in this video session we'll be
discussing about some of the best
laptops for coding
we will discuss various laptops the
features specifications etc in different
price ranges
but before we begin with the laptops
there are some factors that we need to
take care of before buying a laptop for
coding
so now let's discuss the things to keep
in mind while buying a laptop for coding
choosing the finest laptops for
programming is more complicated than
simply purchasing the most expensive
machine available
it must include the necessary components
to assist you in your coding and
programming responsibilities
if you're a programmer you'll
undoubtedly spend hours staring at a
laptop
so you should get one with a good
display and there are many other similar
factors that you should consider
so now here we'll go over several
considerations to make while purchasing
a laptop for code
let's start with the first one which is
ram
ram is one of the most crucial
components in determining the
performance of your machine
it enables your computer to execute many
necessary functions such as loading apps
browsing the internet creating a
spreadsheet and so on the minimum advice
spam for a laptop for programming or
office work is 8gb
this amount will barely get you through
and if you have the money you should
always go with the 16gb option or above
the next thing you should keep in mind
while buying a laptop for coding is
storage
if you want your computer to run swiftly
be sure it has an ssd
this will help your laptop to be fast
and work quickly regardless of the task
ssds make everything faster including
booting up the operating system
compiling code running programs loading
projects and many other things
next up we have the processor
while buying a laptop for coding the
number of cores frequency and thermal
design power are all important
considerations
the minimum processor requirement which
is the single core i5 processor is
sufficient for running simple linear
codes but if you are into advanced
coding and need to run numerous codes at
once a high-end processor like an i7 but
an i9 is recommended
next we have the battery life
the long-lasting battery is necessary if
you're planning to buy a laptop
recording but you will be constantly
working on the laptop for six to eight
hours
next is keyboard it is up to you to
select a keyboard and any keyboard with
an unusual layout such as these in
different places and sizes can cause
problems for you especially because you
will be using it for coding
as a result make a decision about
compactness and low light situations
so there are some of the things that you
must consider while buying a laptop
recording
let's move on and have a look at some of
the laptops that are well suited for
floating

laptops with different price ranges so

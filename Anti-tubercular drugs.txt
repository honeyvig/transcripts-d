hello everybody this is dr. Mallory from
Team MDS conquer now we'll have a short
discussion err anti-tuberculosis so this
is the classification of anti tubercular
drugs basically tuberculosis is a
granulomatous infection so this anti
tubercular drugs are of two types that
is first-line drugs and second-line
drugs again this first-line drugs are of
essential drugs and supplementary drugs
first-line drugs which are essential
includes HR jet a that means has been
sized when he has it the farm person is
our pyro cinema is Z whereas ether butyl
is e we're a supplementary drugs include
streptomycin reefer butan a reefer pen
time and this second line of drugs
includes Co a citizen para - salicylic
acid eg an amide
don't confuse between Ethan amide and
Ethan butyl ether muta is the first line
whereas Ethan amide is a second line
then cyclo serine kanamycin an amicus
and there are newer drugs like
ciprofloxacin clarithromycin and you
throw my sim rifabutin which is also
used as a supplementary drug in the
first line so these are the drugs which
are most effective in mycobacteria
rapidly-growing mycobacteria isin e as
it is very effective in slow-growing
mycobacteria piracy no mind is more
effective and in sport is like within
cases material rifampicin is more
effective then first coming to the drug
isoniazid this is very important drug
because it is the move only and the most
drug each is used in the prophylaxis of
tuberculosis and here this is a pro drug
which is activated by catalase
peroxidase which is denoted by CAD G and
the mechanism of action is it this ëismí
acid will inhibit this keto enol
reductase into mycolic acid synthesis
and this mycolic acid is very important
the cell wall component of my co
bacterium and this entire crosses this
oxygen demand dependent this isoniazid
can be used as both static and cycle
that is bacteriostatic and back to the
side
enjoy extra similar and it can be seen
in CSF and the metabolization is through
acetylation and these are the very
important that was effects like
peripheral neurotics which is treated by
pyridoxine hemolysis in g6pd deficiency
patient's marrow inhibition optic
atrophy lupus like syndrome and
gynecomastia then coming to the
rifampicin and other type of drugs like
rifampicin AR Rifa beauty 9 reefer pen
tine remember the half-life of
rifampicin is 3 to 5 hours and it is
used as only Cyril drug and in empro
action is through inhibiting DNA
dependent RNA polymerase by it can be
secret in the bile hence there is no
adjustment in the renal failure patients
you can see orange color discoloration
of urine when the usage of this drug and
even it can cause blood brain and
placental barrier and adds both intra
and extracellular and even it can be ax
and leprosy also and this is the
prophylactic dragon meningococcal and
Staphylococcus infection but the
treatment is Ruthven Zealand but
prophylaxis is with rifampicin and it
can cause lights in protein area and
hyperlipidemia without as GPT elevations
and these are the all drugs where you
can see drug interactions with the
rifampicin and remember this is a very
important point that rifabutin can be
used in tuberculosis patients with HIV
that means in HIV patients with
tuberculosis the rifabutin is used and
if a patient is an oral contraceptive
plus rifampicin
you have to increase the dose of free
oral contraceptive or change to the
other modes of safety and this para- a
second acid plus rifampicin should not
be used and this patient is and warfarin
then you have to ask the patients to
change to a low molecular weight heparin
if a patient is taking a rifampicin then
it is the safest drug in pregnancy then
other type of drugs like RIF
personally for mutant and reefer Penton
this reefer mutant has a longer
half-life that is 45 hours and can be
used in Clostridium difficile II
associated diarrhea and it can call it
can cause this this is adverse effects
it can cause polymyalgia syndrome and
pseudo jaundice which is important which
causes ello discoloration of the skin
then coming to the reefer pen type it is
a leaf lipophilic and it cannot be used
in HIV and this there is an other drug
called as the facsimile this refax women
can be used in a traveler's diarrhea
treatment which is caused by a coli and
also as in a hepatic encephalopathy
along with anti-tuberculosis and the
coming two other important drug that is
Pyrus an amide resolves a bacterial
Seidel and it will more acting effective
on slowly replicating micro bacteria and
more effective on acidic media and only
intracellular micro bacteria it is
effective and it can cause non go Tiare
algea hyperuricemia qualify and
photosensitivity these are the adverse
effects if coming to the a computer this
is starting drag I'm here there will be
of inhibition of Araby no Galacta which
is present in the cell wall and it
cannot be seen in CSF it can cause optic
neuritis because of this loss of ability
you cannot see green or a red color and
it will have an effect on amacrine and
bipolar cells of retina this is very
important and this cannot be used in
children that is contraindicated in
children it can cause hyper Insignia
peripheral your itis i knew a weak a it
needs and those i just amended renal
failure and it is not hepatotoxic but it
is a real and toxic then coming to the
streptomycin it is a cyril drag and
aurally it cannot be given only
intramuscularly we can use ur
streptomycin and it is only active again
is the extracellular and not hepatotoxic
and there are other amino glycosides
used in 90 TBR
Amica sync animation captain myosin and
this streptomycin is contraindicated in
pregnancy there are few other important
drugs like he was in the zone which is a
static drag and it in cost Steven
Johnson syndrome and this is not used in
the head IV because it causes
hypersensitivity and there is a other
drug param I know salicylic acid it is a
static with a similar action to the
sulfonamides then coming to ithi an
amide it is a static and it can cause
this optic neuritis hypothyroidism it is
very important and it can be used in
leprosy and here bacteria which are
resistant to eyes Nia's it can also
cross resistant to this ethan amide then
coming to Caprio my sim this is an
injectable polypeptide and it can cause
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia this is
very important then Ajith Rama and
clarithromycin are mostly used a non
tubercular atypical mycobacteria
treatment so this is the treatment
regimen for anteater I mean tuberculosis
there is a name called Dodds regimen
that is devotee s that means directly
observed treatment shortcodes this is
for tuberculosis treatment which is
given by 1995 by wh-wha that means
single daily dose of first line of anti
tubercular times are very effective and
again this has been this treatment has
been divided into four categories that
is category 1 2 3 & 4 this category 1
patients include new untreated cases
which are smear positive for
tuberculosis and new untreated smear
negative with tuberculosis and also the
involvement of parenchyma and neo severe
forms like meningitis and miliary
tuberculosis then category 2 patients
include smear positive failure relapse
cases and interrupted cases and this is
very important this category to have a
greater risk of multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis then category 3 include
smear negative pulmonary to
closest with limited parenchymal
involvement then category for England
chronic cases that is multi
drug-resistant tuberculosis cases so
these are the category of patients so
this is the drugs which are given for
category and these numbers includes in
months and these are the doses which can
be given weekly that is subscript and
here these are these for category 1 this
is the initial phase treatment a charger
ES and this is a continuation phase will
have that is HR Hetchy a total of 6
months whereas this a category to
include HR JDS or 1 haytch rj d and in
continuation phase for 5 months you have
to use a char e and this are the HR e
which are given the doses measly and it
can be used for eight months then coming
to the category 3 here there will be of
hey char Z or for HR or 6 Hetchy in
continuous phase and can be used for 6
or 8 months whereas in category 4 if
pregnant patients will use any eyes on e
acid they farm person Pyrus in a mite
and whereas in prophylaxis we can use
only eye sony acid whereas in Mac that
is
Mycobacterium avium complex that is in
HIV we can use clarithromycin
erythromycin plus e thumb util plus or
minus rifabutin
so that's all guys this is these are
very important points regarding anti
tubercular tracks stay tuned for more
videos now learning with MDS panca thank
you

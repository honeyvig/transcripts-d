I know that the PMP was actually the
first course you had on your platform
when you set up your very successful
edtech company you also see people who
are not in the right role so again when
I join a company I do not come with the
idea that I'm going to change the entire
management team you know it's not the
way it works I always try to maximize
the efficiency and effectiveness of the
team I have and give people the right
roles for them and a lot of that is
discussing with them talking to them in
the last two years once you have taken
over we see a lot of new Innovative
products coming out of PMI be it like
PMI Infinity PMI study hall PMI project
management co-pilot should PMI ATP
should be worried it's clearly our
ecosystem we call it the flywheel right
so how all the components of our
ecosystem working together for the same
objective to increase project success of
course atps are absolutely essential to
that ecosystem so not only you should
not be worried but you will see the
scope of what the atps will do expand
last decade or so a lot of new
profession came into being Investment
Banking is like a very celebrated
profession very rewarding data scientist
and product manager how do you see
project management profession
transformation project management is
about transformation it's about creating
something it's about making a move as
long as the the world will have things
to transform we will have project
professionals how do you see AI becoming
an integral part of project management
profession asking PMI to fight AI to
make sure that we can protect our job
that that's not realistic so I'm not
going to try that because it's a bad
idea I think what we need to think about
is how AI is a fantastic opportunity for
us as a profession stories well that's
what most of us have heard others tell
that's what we have probably H to
Growing Up well what makes a great story
maybe it's not that complex a simple
story with little incidents failures
roadblocks and those tiny Milestone that
need to be celebrated maybe it's as
simple as that join me on this journey
as I share uncommon stories of common
people right here with you keeping in
line with the theme of showcasing
uncommon stories of common people today
we have a very special guest let's
connect with Pier LMA the CEO and
president of PMI let's find out who Pier
is the former CEO of several reputed
organizations like conso data who
serving for over 17 years as a CEO of
ipsos one of the largest market research
companies present in over 90 countries
to becoming the CEO and president of PMI
what brought him to PMI how is PMI
making project successful in an era
dominated by artificial intelligence
what does this mean for the numerous
organ organizations government
institutions professionals and learning
platform let's dive into his leadership
tips and skills he would like to share
over to perer while talking about that I
also want to know that what made you
join PMI as a CEO because you have been
a successful CEO for so many different
companies we had so many different
options to take up as a new role So What
attracted you to PMI Mission and and
this whole transformation Journey you
know at this first of all thank you uh
Krishna for inviting me um and thanks
for all the great cooperation between
simply learn and and PMI over the years
and I know that PMP was actually the
first course you had on your platform
when you set up you're a very successful
edtech company um you know at at this
stage of My Life um I accept a job when
I think I can help right so the most
important thing is I looked at the
situation of PMI and I thought I could
help um on one side I had a relevant
experience you know it's um in the
knowledge sector I spent my entire life
yes in different uh kind of Subs segment
of the knowledge sector if you want I
work in Consulting I work in publishing
I worked in uh attech I worked in as you
know in market research uh I worked in
consumer Insight data analytics and I
had also started to work in education
and I come back to that so knowledge
sector for me it's what I've been doing
my entire life the need to scale up to
globalize you know this kind of a
inflection point in any company and I'm
sure as an entrepreneur you understand
what I mean right when you get to the
point where you don't have enough
resources to do what you need to do if
you want to become a real Global player
but you still need to do it right so
that very specific phase in a life of an
organization is something I've done many
times um so I thought I had the relevant
experience for that what is a
non-negotiable virtue when it comes to
leaders or in general somebody that you
want to work in your in your
organization something that is like
non-negotiable and you also think that
that's something you can't teach this is
a virtue either you have or you don't
have uh so there's not so many things
you can teach right so I I most things
you can um you can teach the the problem
is the time you have right so when I
build a team and when I try to turn
around a company I don't want to spend
20 years fixing it right so even if you
see the potential in someone to fix uh
some of their weaknesses you don't want
these weaknesses to be like so far off
to an acceptable level of performance
that you will never get there in a
reasonable time frame right but
otherwise I would not make the statement
that you cannot improve I think I do
believe you can improve in absolutely
everything right so one question I
wanted to like frankly ask you from the
community side that should PMI at ATP
should be worried that maybe PMI is
becoming hiring this a a team they're
launching new product so why can't PMI
itself do all deliver all these training
programs why do they need atps to work
with PMI of of course atps are
absolutely essential to that ecosystem
so not only you should not be worried
but you will see the scope of what the
atps will do expand so if if I see this
whole project management profession it
ex it existed for I don't ever since do
we have documented history somebody
making things happen but in the last I
last decade or so lot of new profession
came into being Investment Banking is
like a very celebrated profession very
rewarding data scientist and and product
manager and somehow this project
management profession kind of became
more like it it lost its like charm or
or glamour glamour if I have to say so
how do you see project management
profession transform me if I look at
from my perspective I think that it
always existed anything that you do
project management is always embedded
you can't deliver unless you manage it
well and everything is a project at end
of the day you know uh you're right to
say that project management has always
existed because in the end project
management is about transformation it's
about creating something it's about
making a move right um and so as long as
the world will have things to transform
we will have project professionals or
people doing project management and I do
not expect the level of transformation
and change to slow down right if
anything it's we all know it's
accelerating and that's why by the way
PMI is growing and everybody's growing
in this profession in the end what what
you're touching is a little bit
different let's let's face it sometimes
there's a lack of recognition you know
so yes if you tell your uh mother-in-law
that you're an investment banker maybe
should' be happy about that I mean I'm
not sure by the way but some you may
think that she will be happy about that
you say you're product manager right now
it's a little more edgy because in Tech
you know project managers are called
Product managers in many cases part of
that is because of course as we know the
the life cycle of a project is not very
clear products evolve all the time so
it's it's been rebranded a little bit
now here I want to move move on to a to
a point that I see you talking about a
lot is AI I would not have imagined am I
talking about AI frankly a few years
back but I I see that when it comes to
AI you have like lot of viewpoints on AI
you are launching AI related products
for the project management community and
how do you see like how do you see AI
becoming a integral part of project
management profession what part of a
typical project manager job do you think
AI can help them become more efficient
at what can I say about AI I think we're
going to reach a point where you know in
this adoption curve that uh that is very
famous from I think I don't know if it's
Forester or gner you know like this
curve um with reach this we've probably
already passed the peak and we would be
in a phase of a disenchantment a little
bit and people would wonder how to use
it effectively and all of that you know
initially especially when um chat GPT
was made was released that a lot of
anxiety surfaced across all professions
but in particular in the project
management profession um you know all
studies all like five years ago saying
that 80% of the tasks of a project
manager will be automated
um created a lot of anxiety frankly uh
in the profession or either anxiety or
sort of a um different kind of
protection reaction right let's not even
talk about it or asking even PMI I heard
that the other day asking PMI to fight
AI to make sure that we can protect our
jobs you know that that's not realistic
so I'm not going to try that
because it's a bad idea I think what we
need to think about is how
AI is a fantastic opportunity for us as
a profession you know we want
recognition good if we can help the
companies we work for transform their
business models their activities their
operations with AI will be very very
recognized trust me so any project
manager who can do that manage your AI
transformation is going to be a big
start

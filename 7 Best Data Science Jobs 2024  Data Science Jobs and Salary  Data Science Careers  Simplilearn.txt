in 2024 data science will offer lots of
exciting job opportunities it's now a
crucial part of many Industries and
companies are looking for people who can
analyze and make sense of data some of
the top data science jobs for 2024
include data analyst data engineer
machine learning engineer and data
scientists these jobs involve handling
extensive data sets crafting intricate
algorithms and harnessing Advanced
statistical methodologies to understand
invaluable insights if you enjoy working
with numbers and solving problems a
career in data science could be a great
choice for you so in this video about
top data science job rules we will
explore the well-paying and valuable
positions available in the field of data
science but before we begin let me ask
you a quick question so what tool is
common used for big data processing and
distributed computing in data science
option A is Excel option b is Apachi
Hado option C is matlb and option D is
Google Docs now you can pause this video
and answer in the comment section below
so let's start with the first one which
is data analysts data analysts have an
important job they collect organize and
analyze big sets of data to find
patterns and Trends they use special
tools to process the data and figure out
important information then they create
reports and visualizations to show their
findings to others this helps people
understand the data better and make
smart decision based on it data analysts
are like detectives who solve puzzles
using numbers and graphs they help
companies and organizations make better
choices by giving them useful insights
from the data they study some of the
most common technical skills for data
analyst are SQL enables data analyst to
manage data in relational databases
through queries and manipulation then
there is spreadsheets software like
excellent Google Sheets for organizing
calculating and presenting data then
statistical programming languages tools
like R and python for Advanced Data
analysis and visualization then there is
machine learning AI driven algorithms to
discover data patterns and make
predictions data visualization data
visualization is used to effectively
convey Data Insights so these were the
skills now let's have a look at the
salary the average salary for a data
analyst varies depending on factors like
experience location and Industry on an
average data analyst can earn
$777,000 per year which is a huge amount
then companies hiring some companies

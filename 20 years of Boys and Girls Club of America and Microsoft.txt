>> Kids can't affect
how they are born.
They can't affect what
family they're born into,
they can't affect the neighborhood
they're born into.
So first and foremost,
we're helping them realize
that just because of
the situation that they're in,
doesn't mean that they're any
less deserving of opportunities.

>> If you know what's going on
with the technology of today,
then you have a greater chance of
making it better in the future.
[MUSIC]
>> I want to become an engineer.
Engineers, they mostly create stuff.
>> Coding will help me do anything I want.
>> Technology will change
the lives of the youth and
kids that we're serving,
because it's not
equal. The access to technology,
it's not equal and this
will level the playing field.
[MUSIC]
>> When they walk up
the stairs and have
a giant smile on their face,
and all they want to do is give
you a hug, that's the best.

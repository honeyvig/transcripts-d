this is super helpful I use this every
day all the time as I move between
different development scenarios but also
different monitor setups a lot of people
have gone back to the offices but a lot
of people have not we tend to move
between different screen resolutions and
different monitor setups I want to make
sure that no matter where I am where I'm
plugged in what screen setup I've got
Visual Studio is always in an optimal
condition to allow me to do my best work
so here I have Visual Studio you know
and I have my various different Windows
like the toolbox and I have the solution
Explorer and this works well for this
particular monitor with this resolution
that I'm using right now when I'm
sitting with my laptop I want more of a
kind of a minimal layout like this so in
this situation I have a small screen so
I don't want all these tool Windows to
show up I need that extra space to code
when I work on extensions I like my
layout to be a little bit different and
then when I'm at my ultra wide I really
like to spread out horizontally over
that big area let's say you have dual
monitors you could actually take the
different tool windows in visual studio
and spread out on these various
different monitors let's open a window
here a tool window the test Explorer and
let's imagine that I take this and I
drag that onto my secondary monitor all
I have to do to save that Windows layout
so I can easily come back and forth to
it is to go to window it's a save window
layout and then we give it a name let's
call it testing so now I've saved this
layout if I go go back up to window you
can see that I have all of my saved
Windows layouts right here and I can
apply any of them you can go through
this one and then back to the one we
just created
testing
and I can do that with keyboard
shortcuts

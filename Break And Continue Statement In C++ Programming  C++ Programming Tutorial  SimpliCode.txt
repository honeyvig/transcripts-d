hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this session we
will learn about the break and continue
statements in c plus so before we jump
in
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
so break and continue both are known as
jump statements
these are called jump statements because
they are used to skip jump or terminate
the statements inside the loop
whether it is a while loop do while loop
or a for loop
so let's start with the break statement
first
in c plus break statements are used to
terminate the execution of the loop
and by terminating the execution of loop
we means finishing or stopping the
execution
like if we want to block or terminate a
loop at some point all we need to do is
to use the break statement with a
condition
on which we want the loop to stop and it
will terminate the loops flow or
iterations so break statements are
mainly used for two cases
one is it can be used inside the loop
and second is
it is mostly used in switch statements
and this is the loop's flow diagram in
which first there is a loop body then if
the condition is true then there is a
break statement which will terminate the
loop and if the condition is not true
then the loop will continue to iterate
as you can see in this example the loop
is iterating from 0 to 10. inside the
loop there is a condition and then the
break statement
which will make sure that the loop will
terminate when i becomes equal to 4
after the break statement the control
will jump out of the loop body and
that's how the break statement works its
output would be
0 1 2 3 it will not exceed 4 because of
the break statement
now coming to continue statement the
continue statement is a bit similar to
the break statement as it is also used
for termination
but the difference is that it is used to
terminate the current iteration and not
the complete loop for example if a loop
is hydrating from 0 to 6 and inside the
loop there is a continue statement on 4
then all the elements will be printed
except for
because continue statement skips that
particular iteration and continues with
the next one
and in break statement the complete loop
flow terminates
so when the continue statement is used
then within the loop the control skips
or terminates that particular iteration
and continues with the next iteration
as you can see in this example
first loop body
then there is a condition
if that is true then the continue
statement will terminate
and continues it with the next iteration
and if that is false then control will
go to the remaining part of the as
always
now in this example we are using
continue statement here the loop is
iterating from 0 to 10
inside the loop there is a condition and
then the continue statement
which will make sure that if the value
of i becomes 4 then terminate that
iteration and moves to the next
situation
after that elements are getting printed
with the help of c out function
now its output would be
1 2 3
5
6 7 8 9
it will not display 4 because of
continue statements as we know that the
continue statement skip that particular
iteration so when we use i equals 2
equals to 4
then it skips that particular iteration

the battle what if you could do that for

alright so as we have covered the
theoretical part so now let's do some
examples on breaking continuous
statements in our code editor that is vs
code
all right so let's create a new file
and let's name it
continue
dot cpp
all right
now let's save it
so now first of all we will include the
header files
iostream
then the namespace standard
so here we will do an example in which
we will iterate a loop from 0 to 30 and
we will display
all the elements which are not divisible
by 2 from 0 to 30
and in here we will use a while loop so
let's start
so first of all we will include the main
function and inside the main function we
will declare a variable i
now after that we'll use a while loop
and we'll write i less than
30.
now inside
this while loop will increment i plus
plus
because we want the loop to move forward
so that is why we are incrementing here
and now we will
write the if statement and inside the if
statement will write a condition
which will exclude all those elements
which are divisible by 2.
so we'll write
i
mod
2
0
equals to 0
then
continue
now here what we are doing is we are
skipping or excluding all these elements
which are divisible by 2.
here we are displaying the elements
and
we'll write slash d
to add some horizontal space in between
them
then here right and l
and after that return
0
all right now let's save it and check
the brackets first um
yes
the
if condition
inside if condition there is only
continue statement and this bracket is
off while loop
and this is an extra bracket
all right now let's save it again
and let's try to run this
as you can see
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29
all of these are not divisible by 2 so
we have skipped all those
digits or numbers which are divisible by
2
with the help of this continue statement
now let's do another example
let's name it break dot cpp
and
let's save it
now here we will do an example in which
we will use both the continue and break
statements and in the example
we will display the cars
which are taking part in the race
so first of all let's include the header
files
we'll start with hash include iostream
now using the namespace standard
now inside the main function
first of all we will declare a car
variable
let's say the variable name is car
number
alright so here would be two types of
races one is drag race and another one
is lab race and the cars are denoted as
car numbers
and there's a condition if in the drag
race one player even if one player is
not present then the race will be
cancelled and there is no such condition
in lab race
so now we'll start with
drag race
so first of all
we will display
drag race
now
using the for loop
we will iterate the car numbers from 0
to 10 as there are total 10 cars
so int
car
number 0
car number
less than
10
car number plus plus
all right now inside this for loop we
are using if condition
like let's say if car number four is not
attending the race
then we'll write
car
car number four and inside the if
condition will write break
if car number four is not attending the
race then there would be no race as
if one
if only one car would back out then
there would be no race as per the
condition
all right
so
as we can see break will terminate the
entire loop
so it will display
0 1 2 3
so it's the condition for the drag race
now let's do
for the libraries
maintain some space
slash and we'll use
now we'll write
lapras
now inside this slab race we'll again
use a for loop
as we have done above and car number
from 0 to
less than 10
car number plus plus
we forgot to write n over here now
car number plus plus
all right now inside this for loop
we'll use if statement
and write the same condition that is if
car number
is
4
the car number is 4
then inside this will write
continue because we know in the lab race
it is okay if one or two players skips
the race
the race won't stop unlike the drag race
so
simply will write
the variable name car number
and after that return 0
all right we are done
now we can save it and let's try to run
this
hope it works
all right so there are some errors so
let's check
okay so
here we have used this extra bracket
because our for loop
bracket is here
now
let's save it again
and run it
as you can see
drag race 0 1 2 3 so car number 0 1 2 3
and it is not exceeding 4 because we
have used this break statement
and in the
lab race as you can see 0 1 2 3
5 6 7 8 9
as we have used continue at car number 4
so car number 4 is getting
skipped
so the rest of the cars will raise till
the end
so in this example we have used both
continue and break statements now in the
next example we will use break
statements in switch case so let's do
that
let's create a new file
and let's name it
break 2 dot cpp
all right so here we will do an example
of break statement and we'll use it in
switch case statements
and the example is there are five
contenders and one of them won the
lottery and the others came second third
and fourth so we'll do that with the
help of break statement
so let's start first of all we'll
include the header files
hash include iostream
now the name space standard
now inside the main function
we'll write
inside main int main and inside this
will declare a variable
num equals 7
we are assigning 7 to it as of now i'll
tell you later
now using the switch statement inside
the switch statement we will write the
variable name num
now after that
inside this switch statement
we'll make the cases as we know in
switch how the switch statements work
we'll make the cases like let's say the
first case is case 4
so it means if the value of num is 4
then
whatsoever we write
inside this under this that will be
displayed if the value of num is 4
all right
so
we'll write lose
and after that end l
all right then
we will
here we will write the break statement
here the break statement will stop the
execution of the process
all right
now after that
similarly we will make case another
cases
like let's say after this we'll make
another case
case
six
now in the case six
the person came forth
so there are prizes
to others as well
but the first prize
is won by num7 as of now
now
another case would be
case
seven now let's write seven
and we'll write here you won
now after that
another case would be let's say one
game second yeah
let's write game
second
now case eight
came third
so after each case as you can see as we
have
wrote the message you won came second
came third we are using break statement
because we want to terminate the process
because once the player has selected a
number then we don't want the player to
select another number we want the
process to stop there so that is why we
have used the break statement over here
now after that let's
write return 0
all right
now
return 0
and
save it and now let's try to run this
as we have selected seven
num equals seven so you won if let's say
we have selected four
as we have assigned four
now save it again
so it will display you lose
and if we write six
save it
then
it will display game fourth
as you can see
so this was another example of break
statement in switch cases
so we have covered some examples of both
the jump statements that is continuing
break statements in c plus you can try
them in order to understand it better
all right with that we have come to the
end of this video if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up i hope it
really helped you all thanks for

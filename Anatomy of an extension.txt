a visual studio extension project is a
normal c-sharp project but with a few
things that make it unique
so let's go through
and highlight some of those to get a
better understanding of what makes a
visual studio extension
we'll start by creating a new v6 project
by searching for the v6 community
templates and we'll select the one
with a command
this is one of the more commonly used
templates
we'll also give it a name let's call it
my demo
the c sharp project is created and we
can see we have a bunch of nuget
packages already referenced
it also contains a command class
an extension icon
and a v6 manifest
this is where we keep metadata about our
extension such as a name
make sure to specify a descriptive name
here
we also need to specify a unique product
id it can be any string
and make sure to give your extension a
good description
you can specify a license
as many comma separated tags as you want
and a url to your github repository
next we'll look at the visual studio
command table file it's an xml file that
lets us define
commands menus groups key bindings and
other things about our extension
a group can contain multiple menus and
commands and a button here is just a
different word for command
i can also set my key bindings to
automatically trigger
one of these buttons
the package class is the entry point for
most extensions
here we can register services tool
windows and in our case
commands
this will automatically find all
commands and register them with visual
studio
and if we look at our command we can see
it's a very simple class
that handles the command click the same
command that we defined in our xml
command table file
i'll build the project like any
other.net project
and that will produce the output in the
bin directory
the output of an extension project
is a file called
a v6 file and that is my extension
i can simply double click
the v6
file to start the visual studio
extension installer
this is the extension file that i want
to publish to the visual studio
marketplace or share with my colleagues
if you're curious to see what's inside a
v6 file
simply rename it to sip
and open it in the file explorer and
that will show you everything inside
the v6 container file
so now that you know what makes an
extension project an extension project
you're now ready to build your first
extension

hi my name is Augustine Popa and I'm a
product manager on the Microsoft C++
team working on VC package VC package is
a free and open- Source CN C++ package
manager it is designed with Simplicity
in mind solving many common problems
that come up when managing Library
dependencies some of these problems are
intrinsic to these programming languages
and require a more creative solution
than you perhaps may be used to with
package managers for other languages in
this video I will give an overview of VC
package
and how it can support you as a
developer in just under 10
minutes whether you are a student
hobbyist developer or professional in
the industry I hope you will find this
tool helpful for your CN C++
development VC package is supported on
Windows Mac OS and Linux and can run on
your local machine or your preferred
continuous integration environment you
can also use it with your preferred
compiler or build system as VC package
is designed to be as flexible as
possible it also builds packages from
Source meaning you can choose your
preferred build configuration including
platform architecture and compiler Flags
so that it matches your development
environment in CN C++ this is important
because a project cannot depend on a
library that is compiled in a different
way with that said you can absolutely
download pre-built libraries using the
binary caching feature this feature
allows you to point to a package feed
like iub packages Azure artifacts or a
Nate feed HTTP provider or other cloud
storage provider that allows you to
upload and store Buy binaries and other
files once this link is active VC
package will automatically cach
libraries and builds and subsequently
download them from the cache when
someone else on your team or your
continuous integration system needs a
new copy in other words you only need to
build from Source once then cash the
output for reuse later BC package will
verify if something has changed in your
build configuration and do a fresh build
only if
necessary in VC package a port is a
build recipe that produces a package
package a port has a version number for
the corresponding package it produces as
well as a port version that is used when
you want to make changes to the build
recipe itself VC package also has
triplets a triplet captures the target
build environment such as the CPU OS
compiler and runtime in a single
convenient name VC package provides over
70 default tripl lists that you can
build with but you can also Define your
own to install a package on your system
VC package runs a port file which is a
cake script the script typically
contains steps to download source code
or run a build but can do a lot more as
it is highly
customizable BC package comes with a
massive open- Source Library registry
that is actively maintained by the CN
C++ Community you can download over
2,000 unique customizable and publicly
available CN C++ libraries you can
choose with versions or features of
these libraries you wish to install and
as stated earlier VC package can produce
a custom build based on your desired
Bill configuration VC package will
automatically install any transitive
dependencies that is dependencies of
dependencies without you having to list
every single one out furthermore the VC
package open source registry is
Thoroughly tested by a continuous
integration process the CNC Plus+
Library ecosystem is very fragmented and
diverse many libraries depend on each
other and sometimes they disagree about
things like what version of another
Library they want VC package resolves
all of this in the open source registry
the registry is a git repo and at any
point in time in the history of that
repo acts as a baseline tracking a set
of libraries that are each set to a
particular version whatever Baseline you
choose to follow you can download the
libraries of your choosing without
having to manually resolve version
conflicts
yourself there are two ways to install
libraries using VC package classic Mode
allows you to run console commands
specifying which libraries you want
these libraries are then installed under
the VC package inst directory this is an
easy way to get started with VC package
if you're just looking to get up and
running fast however for most users we
recommend manifest mode in this mode VC
package takes a manifest file called VC
package.json as input and builds
packages in a subfolder of your actual
project the Manifest file can list your
library dependencies library features
version constraints and other relevant
inputs since this is a basic text file
you can check it into your Source
control repository so your whole team
can make use of it furthermore it is
very useful for achieving reproducible
builds VC package will strictly follow
the instructions in the Manifest file
and will never change the libraries
versions or features it installs
afterward if you want to make a change
to your dependencies in the future you
must edit the Manifest file accordingly
to give VC package new
instructions VC package versions
packages differently than most package
managers as I mentioned earlier you can
list out your desired packages and point
to a baseline which provides you with a
reasonable set of default package
versions
but you can also Define a minimum
version constraint or an override a
minimum version constraint lets you set
a particular package to a version
greater than the Baseline there's no
such thing as a maximum version
constraint in VC package as it will
always choose the minimum one that
agrees with your manifest file if you
set a minimum version constraint it will
only attempt to download a higher
version if VC package detects that the
minimum version won't build successfully
with your other
dependencies but given a particular
manifest file as input VC package will
always build the exact same set of
dependencies every time whether you do
it today or five years in the
future lastly VC package supports
overrides overrides let you ignore VC
package's normal version resolution and
opt for more traditional package
management experience where you can pick
and choose exactly which versions of a
package you want to install however this
does leave it up to you to resolve any
version conflicts that may arise we
recommend using overrides only when
absolutely
necessary I me mentioned earlier that VC
package comes with a large open source
registry of libraries but you can also
Define your own custom Registries for
other libraries this works fundamentally
the same way as the open source registry
for instance you can set up a registry
as a git repo and take advantage of the
versioning and manifest features that VC
package provides a registry can also be
configured as a basic file system a
common application of Registries popular
with professional teams is to Fork the
open source registry so you have your
own private copy this lets you tight
control everything that goes into the
registry and what your developers can
access you can run your own custom scans
and ensure you are meeting any
compliance or security requirements for
your organization and since it's a fork
you can pull from the VC package public
registry anytime you want to get updates
you may also want to set up a registry
for your own private libraries you can
organize these as you see fit and give
your team the same user interface to
install these libraries as they would be
using for open source
ones now I mentioned earlier that VC
packages build system agnostic you can
configure it with your preferred
environment with that said VC package
has some additional support for Ms build
and cmake projects that is worth calling
out in manifest mode you can configure
your project system to automatically run
VC package so that it can restore any
dependencies that are needed on the fly
at build time in Ms build this is done
by setting some project properties in
cmake this is done by pointing to the VC
package cic tool chain file another
benefit of doing this configuration step
is that these build systems will become
aware of the locations where VC package
is installing libraries so you don't
have to manually point to where your
library headers and binaries will be
located next let's talk about IDE and
editor support as a VC package has grown
in popularity it has been adopted by
several different coding environments
the visual studio IDE actually SS
actually ships with VC package if you
choose to include C++ components during
the installation process but you can
also use an external copy of VC package
which is necessary if you want to use
classic mode and install libraries to
location of your choosing outside of
your project in Visual Studio
installation directory VC package is
also supported in Visual Studio code you
will need to use an external copy of VC
package and install the Microsoft CN C++
extension and if you are a cmake user we
recommend also installing the cmake
tools extension lastly the jetbrain cine
IDE also added VC package integration
you can find documentation about this
experience on their website another VC
package feature useful for professional
development teams in particular is asset
caching asset caching allows VC package
to work in an offline build environment
which some organizations prefer for
security reasons it is also useful if
you have continuity of business rules to
comply with it uses download mirrors to
upload and restore assets like source
code and build tools needed to install
packages and that's it this video
covered all the major features currently
available in VC package keep in mind
that VC package is an active open source
project and we are continuing to add to
it over time if you want to learn more

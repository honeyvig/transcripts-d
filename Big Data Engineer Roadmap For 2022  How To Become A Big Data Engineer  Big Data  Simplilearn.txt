what is required to become big data
engineer
a big data engineer doesn't require to
have a particular degree or anything in
sort of that so there is no much
requirement for a big data engineer
the big data market size is projected to
grow from
162.6 billion us dollars in 2021 to 273
billion us dollars in 2026.
so now you can estimate what will be the
future of big data
according to the dystec job report
conducted in 2020 data engineering is
the fastest growing hub in the field of
technology so glassdoor predicts that an
average big data engineer in india will
open up his job with 7 lakh 97201
rupees per year
these bugs will increase with your
experience level on top of that big data
engineering is a pretty interesting
field to opt as it is compiled with many
interesting tasks and challenges so what
are you waiting for if you are good at
numbers and analytics this is the thing
for you by the end of this video you
will find out the role played by a big
data engineer
before pursuing the big data kinder role
it is important to know who is a big
data engineer
who is a big data engineer before that
let us see if can answer this question
so
select the role played by a big data
engineer
a data engineer
b analyst engineer
c i t engineer
and d generalist
leave your answer in the comment section
below stay tuned to find out the answer
now let us know who is a big data
engineer
a data engineer is basically an idf
professional whose job is to analyze the
data data engineers main job is to
collect the data from different source
systems and use them for operational
purposes
to use only the most useful data they
gather the data and filter
depending on the size
of the data their operation may vary
the complexity of
engineers work increases with the size
of the organization larger data sets are
available from large businesses today
data drive every sector they identify
their target market gather data and put
it into good use do you know what a data
scientist do together these data
scientists and data engineers do their
business the data must be gathered by a
data engineer for usage by data
scientist when it comes to gathering and
analyzing data for later use a data
engineer is a company pioneer
future marketing and company development
efforts are what
they are intended to do data engineers
deal with all the types of data
it may be structured as well as
unstructured so structured data is
nothing but data that is organized in a
specific way unstructured data
is audio or video files in your phone
data engineers must know about the
architecture of working of such datasets
data engineers should handle all these
datasets there are many tools to handle
them also for this you can go for the
best big data tools video on our channel
now let us talk about
role play by big data engineers in any
organization
data engineers focus on collecting and
preparing data for use by data scientist
and analyst
they take on three main roles they are
as
follows database centric engineers
these data engineers are tasked with
implementing maintaining and populating
analytics databases
the role is typically exist at larger
companies where data is distributed
across several databases the engineers
work with pipelines tune databases for
efficient analysis and create table
schemas using extract transform node
methods
a database centric project at a large
multi-sets or national food delivery
service would be designed an analytics
database in addition to creating the
database the data engineer would write
the code to get from where it is
collected in the main application
database into the analytics database for
all these you are required to have a
basic skill set
next is pipeline centric engineer
these data engineers typically work on
mid-size data analytics
and more complicated data science
project across distributed systems a
regional food delivery company might
undertake a pipeline centric project to
create a tool for data scientist and
analyst to search for information about
deliveries in order to determine
what it signifies for the company's
future business they can look at the
distance traveled and the amount of time
needed for the deliveries
so what do a generalist do
working in small teams data engineers
with a general emphasis often collect
process and analyze data from beginning
to end
they may have more skill than a big data
or most big data engineers but
less knowledge of system architecture a
project a generalist data engineers
might undertake for a small metro area
food delivery service would be to create
a dashboard that displays the number of
deliveries made each day for the past
month and forecast the delivery volume
for all this you are required to have a
basic skill set in the coming slide we
are going to discuss it in detail
so what are the skill set required to
become a big data engineer
so the important skill set is the
programming language
python r and sql are the three most
important languages data engineers use
next
etl tools and risk oriented apis
engineers need a good understanding of
etl tools and rest oriented apis for
creating and managing data integration
jobs these skills also help in providing
data analysts and business users with
simplified access to prepare data sets
data engineers must also understand no
sql databases and apache spark system
business intelligent platforms and the
ability to configure them are another
important focus for data engineers
next
comes
machine learning
and unix
although machine learning is more in the
data scientist or machine learning data
engineer skill set data engineers must
also understand it
they should know how to deploy machine
learning algorithms and gain insights
from them
lastly knowledge of unix-based operating
system is more important unix scalar is
and linux provide functionality and root
access that other os such as mac os and
windows cannot provide they give the
user more control over the operating
system which is useful for data
engineers
and lastly
they should have understanding about big
data tools
like hadoop table cassandra mongodb etc
so
why to adopt big data engineering as a
career what makes big data engineers
stand up
so this slide gives answer to all these
questions
data engineering is the most important
thing that every data analyst will
prefer everyone is aspiring to become
one due to scope and value
there are many job vacancies across the
world
pertaining to data engineering
the amount of data produced is
increasing day by day as every company
relies on data
data engineering is difficult to define
precisely it is basically about
designing
and building the data infrastructure
needed to collect clean and format data
making it accessible and useful for end
users it is sometimes considered an
extension of software engineering or as
a kissing of data science
is also a crucial step in the hierarchy
of data science needs without the
architecture built by data engineers the
analysts and scientists would be able to
access data and work with data and that
risk leaving organizations unable to
leverage on their most valuable
resources
next comes
certifications needed for a data
engineer
simply learn provides very interesting
courses for a data engineer or aspiring
to become a data engineer
so
initially the course will have
introduction to big data engineering
next
it will have introduction to hadoop
and
after that
pi sparks training
pi sparking is nothing but a tool
and afterwards the course will have
apache kafka
and after that
mongodb
and develop mongod i repeat and after
that mongodb developer and administrator
and you will also learn about aws
analytics certification
and
big data capstone
and finally you will receive a master
certificate on big data engineering
i will give the link for this course in
the description
moving on we will know about what are
the companies
hiring big data engineers and salaries
offered
i will list the important companies
hiring big data engineer
google google will provide 1 27 000 us
dollars as annual income
the famous companies like facebook will
provide
175
881
u.s dollars as annual income for a big
data engineer
and salesforce is another big company
that will provide
152 000
average salary for a big data engineers
and well-known company like microsoft
will provide
165 000 us dollars
and very famous company like amazon will
provide 109 000 us dollars for a big
data engineers isn't this data is
amazing
this is all about the companies or big
tech companies hiring big data engineers
and salaries offered by them

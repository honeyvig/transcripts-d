youtube channel today we will learn
about c plus plus basics
in this tutorial we will be learning
about all the important fundamentals of
c plus plus programming
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
so in this c
basics tutorial first we will be
learning about the basics of c plus plus
programming that is types variables and
if else etc
then we will understand how to download
and install c plus in windows 10.
after that we will cover topics like
loops in c plus plus arrays and
functions in c plus plus
then we will go through object oriented
programming in c plus plus and concepts
of oops like inheritance and
polymorphism
we'll also learn about pointers
constructors and destructors in c plus
and at last we will cover c plus plus
enumeration
so without further ado let's get started
and welcome to this tutorial on c plus
plus basics so let's jump in and see
what's in it for us
so we will be covering today the basics
of c plus that is we will learn how to
write your first program in c plus plus
then types and variables in c plus after
that topics like arrays strings if else
statements for loop while loop and
functions
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's start with the introduction to
c plus plus programming
c plus plus is a popular programming
language introduced by john strawstrom
in the year 1979. the aim was to make a
dynamic language that is efficient and
has some additional features to see
initially it was called c with classes
as it was an extension to c language but
later renamed as c plus plus
it is general purpose case sensitive
language and it is called pre-compiled
language because it converts the source
code directly to the machine
understandable code
it is an intermediate level language
because it contains both features of
high level and low level language
c plus plus supports the features of
object oriented language like
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
etc it also supports procedural
programming and functional programming
as well
now as we have understood about c plus
plus programming
let's move on to our first program in c
plus
so the first program for beginners is
hello world program
in this program hello world is printed
it is very basic program and in the
first part of the program we are
including a header file hash include
iostream
header files are generally used to
import features into the program
functions like c in which is used to
take the input from the user and c out
which is used to display the output are
defined in this ifc header file
here using namespace standard means
we are using all the things which are
within the standard library
the second part of the program is main
function
this is a special function from where
the execution of program starts
inside the main function we are printing
hello world using the c out which is
used to print the output
return 0 on the next line will indicate
the program that nothing will return and
program executed successfully
so let's try this hello world program on
our code editor that is vs code
so let's first of all name the file
hello dot cpp
so first of all we'll include the header
files
hash include iostream
and then namespace standard we'll write
using namespace
std
now we'll write the main function that
is int main
now inside this function
we will print using
see out
and
we'll write
hello
world
after that we will write return zero
all right now let's try to run this
as you can see
hello world is getting printed over here
so this is how it's done
so now let's move to our next topic
that is types and variables
coming to types and variables
in c plus there are different types of
data type that acts as a keyword which
is responsible to define a variable
first is boolean data type
this keyword is used when we have two
values either true or false and these
values are used when there are
conditions for example if the condition
is satisfied then it's true otherwise it
will return false
next is character data type
this character data type is used when we
are dealing with alphabets and symbols
and it is used to hold a single
character within the variable
integer data type
this data type is used for integer
values they can be both positive and
negative
next is flow data type
float is used when we want to store
values that are in decimal form
now variables
variables are used with these data types
it is generally used to store values
and this is the syntax to define a
variable
first we will mention the data type and
then the variable name of our choice
for example int is the data type and
data is the variable name
moving to arrays
arrays are one of the most important and
widely used concepts in c plus plus it
can be defined as a collection of
similar kind of elements the elements of
array are stored in contiguous memory
locations that is one after the other
arrays make it possible to store
multiple values of the same data type
into a single variable
the syntax to declare an array is first
we will mention the data type then the
array name and after that number of
elements inside the brackets
our next topic is strings
we can define strings as a collection or
group of characters
it is basically used to represent text
in the program
and we can perform many operations on
strings in order to manipulate it
the syntax of string contains a
collection of characters surrounded by
double quotes for example here string is
the type
str is the name of the string and coffee
is the value that is assigned to the
string
in c plus there are two ways to create a
string
first is c style strings
in c style strings collection of
characters are stored in the form of
arrays they are basically areas of type
character
the second way is using string objects
we can create string object to hold a
string
they are implemented in the standard
library which we must include in the
program using hash include
next is if fell statements
if else are two conditional statements
that are generally used when we want to
run the code based on some conditions
we run a block of code which is inside
if statement only if the condition is
true for example
if the number variable here is equal to
10
then only the block of code will execute
and will print the message you got it
otherwise it will run the else block and
display the message written inside that
block which is not this one
now coming to loops
first is for loop
for loop is the repetition control
structure
that allows us to repeat a block of code
for a fixed number of times
instead of repeating the same code again
and again
the syntax of for loop has three parts
first is initialization it is used to
initialize the loop
next is condition
which is used to determine when to end
the loop and last is updation which is
used to update the loop variables
for example inside the loop i equal to 0
means we have initialized the loop from
0 and i less than 10 means the loop will
keep on repeating until i becomes less
than 10
that is it will repeat for 10 times in
total
from 0 to 9 and i plus plus denotes that
we are incrementing the loop after each
iteration by one
another type of loop is while loop
while loop are used in c plus plus when
we don't know the exact number of times
the loop should repeat
it repeats the statements till the given
condition is true
the syntax for while loop is while
keyword and condition in the brackets
and the loop will iterate till that
condition is true
and once the condition becomes false
then the control passes outside the loop
for example in this while loop the
condition is number less than 10
that means the loop will keep nitrating
till the number is less than 10
that is till when it becomes equal to 9
and inside the loop after printing the
variable number we are incrementing the
variable because we want to increment
the variable number after each iteration
now
moving on to functions
functions in c plus are group of
statements that are designed to perform
a specific task
it allows us to write a code inside the
function and then we can use that code
every time when we need it
by simply mocking the function
we can also pass arguments to the
function
the syntax of function is
type function name
and then the parameters
inside the function brackets we can
write the code and we can invoke the
function by calling it from the main
function
so as we have understood these concepts
so let's move on to our code editor that
is vs code to do some examples on these
concepts
so here we will do an example
in which we will find the number of even
elements and odd elements using array
for loop and if else statements
so let's first of all
make a new file
let's name this file as
basic dot cpp
okay so first of all we'll include the
header files
now we will write using namespace
standard
now we will include int main
and
int main
and here we will declare an array
arr
and we'll write
and we'll mention the elements
2
7 let's say 12 and
9.
okay
now
first of all we'll initialize the
variables let's say
int even
zero and we'll initialize
odd variable
with 0 as well
now
we'll write
int length
because we want to find
size of the array and for that we will
write
size of
array name
then
divide size of
array of
zero
so now i'll explain this part
here we have an array which has five
integers and since size of an integer is
four bytes therefore size of error is 5
into 4 that is 20 bytes
now int length we have written int
length equals size of array divided by
size of array of 0 that is 20 divided by
4
that is equal to 5
so 5 is the size
here size of array of 0
is the size of element at index 0.
we can take any index here like arrow 1
array of two or array of three
so now we know the length of the array
so
here we will include the for loop
and
we'll start with int i equals zero
we have initialized i with 0
now i less than
length
this one
here i have written i less than length
that is i less than 5
okay
now i plus plus we are incrementing it
now we have to
use if condition because we want to find
the even elements and the odd elements
and for that we have to include if
condition
so we'll write if
array
of i
mod 2
that is
if
an element on
dividing by 2 gives 0 as a remainder
gives 0 as a remainder then it will it
is even element
so
we'll increment the even variable this
which we have initialized 0 will
increment over here
okay
so now
in else block
we'll write
odd
plus plus
it means that if this condition is not
true then the odd variable will
increment
all right
now
we will
print the variables
so
we'll write
even numbers
and we are printing these outside the
follow so that they
don't repeat
with the for loop so that is why we have
printed these outside the for loop okay
now
we'll write the variable even
and l for the new line
similarly we'll write odd number
or numbers
the variable odd
and after that we'll write
return zero
okay so this is the code
so now let's try to run this one
there is some error
okay
yeah the spelling is wrong
okay let's try again
yeah here it is
as we can see
even numbers 2 or numbers 3
we can
check it
like even numbers 2 12.
there are two even numbers and 1 7 9
there are three odd numbers
so in this question we have
used array for loop and if
else so now let's try
some other example
okay
let's name this as
basic two
dot cpp
all right first of all we'll include the
header file
hash include i stream
now using namespace standard
okay now we will do an example in which
we will print the elements from 1 to 20
using while loop and with the help of
function
so first of all
we'll start with intermittent
and inside into main we'll simply
call or invoke the function
by writing the name of the function this
is the name of the function print
function
okay so here we are calling this
function and after that return 0 will
write
okay now
we have to make this function
let's create
void
what is the data type print function
is the name
and inside this function
will first of all initialize i
the variable i with 1.
now we'll use while loop
and
we'll write the condition
i less than equal to 20. this means that
the loop will keep on
repeating until i becomes less than
equal to 20.
so basically it will
move from 1 to 20 times
in total the loop will repeat for 20
times
so now
all we have to do is
we'll just print the i variable
and
in order to give some space
between each element
while printing so that is why we have
used double quotes with the space
between them
now will
increment
i plus plus
so that i will increment after each
iteration
all right now
here we have called this function and it
is getting printed inside the function
itself so let's try to run this one
here we can see this is the output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
up to 20
as i have told you
as you have put the condition less than
equal to 20 so that is why 20 is also
getting printed because we have used
equal to over here
so
we have called the function print
function and inside that function we
have initialized the variable i with 1
and we have put the condition i less
than equal to 20 so that is where the
loop is getting repeated for 20 times
and i is getting printed inside the loop
and after that we have used increment
operator so that the value of i gets
updated everything after every single
iteration
so this is the output so now let's move
on to the next example
so
let's make a new file
and name it as basic three dot cpv
so here we will do an example of string
and we'll do some push back and pop back
operation on it
so first of all we'll include the header
file
hash include iostream
then using namespace standard
namespace standard
okay now
we'll start with int main
all right first of all we'll write
string
data type
then the name of the string
s
eras is the name of the string
all right now
first of all we will display a message
to enter a string
so
okay enter a string
now
get line
this is the syntax when you want to take
the input
of a string
so
get line c in is used to take the input
and s is the name of the string
so this is how we take the input
and
now we will print another message saying
that
you have entered
now here we will print the string s
next line
and l
okay
now
we'll do some operations like s dot
pushback
this will add an element at the end of
the string
so
let's say we want to add
y so we'll write y inside the bracket
s dot push back and inside the bracket
with single quotes we'll try it
y
now will display a message saying
after
after using
pushback function
will print the string
that is after using the function
pushback the string would look like this
and
now
we'll use another function s dot pop
back
it will delete the element from the end
so
we'll write c out
and we'll display the message
after using pop back function
let's write pop back only
and we'll print the
string
okay
now after that we'll write return 0
and i think it's done only the spelling
is wrong over here
okay
yeah now let's try to run this
you can see the message enter a string
so let's say i have entered
barcelona
so you have entered barcelona after
using pushback barcelona y
because we have used y
over here we want to add y at the end of
the string
so after using pushback barcelona y and
pop back function after that we have
used and we know that it will delete the
element from the end so
here we can see there is no y
power back function have deleted the
element
so this is our output
and
these were some basic examples of c plus
plus basics it includes the
examples of array for loop if else and
functions strings we have covered
and there are some more examples on each
of these topics so i suggest you to
please practice them all and that is how
you will get a good understanding on all
of these topics
so
you can try some more examples on it how
you can install c plus plus on vs code
and dev c plus
after we are done with installation
we'll also learn how to run a program on
both of these code editors
so we'll start with visual studio code
to download vs code let's go to google
and search for visual studio code
or vs code
we'll click on this first link this is
the official web page for downloading
the visual studio code
and we'll now click on this download for
windows blue button
and now we'll click on download now
here it is getting download and
as you can see
thanks for downloading visual studio
code for windows
once we are done with the download we
can click on this open folder
here it is
now we need to install this file so
we'll double click on this file
and this is the setup wizard
we'll click on this i accept the
agreement
and we'll click on next
as we have accepted the licensing
agreement now
we can select our destination folder or
we can leave it as it is but make sure
there must be 293.2 mb of free space on
that particular disk space
now
we'll click on next
here we can again click on x there is no
need to change over here
and now
you can click on this create a desktop
icon button or anyone else as per your
choice
now we'll click on next
and now we'll click finally on install
it is getting installed it will take
some time
now we can click on this finish button
launch visual studio we have marked it
it is already marked so when we click on
this finish button it will launch the
visual studio code
so as we can see this is the visual
studio code
so as we have installed vs code now we
have to configure it so that the c plus
plus programs can run in this code
editor
so in order to do that we need to add
some extensions so we'll click on this
extensions button
now here we will write code runner
extension
write code runner
and this is extension
when click on this install
and it is getting installed
there are some instructions we can click
on control plus alt plus n
or press f1 and then select type run
code
but we'll deal with that later
now
[Music]
we'll add another extension that is
c
slash c plus
plus here it is
we'll click on this install
here we can see downloading visual
studio windows debugger
it is getting installed and i think it
is installed now
so as we have added both the extensions
so let's move on and do a program of cps
plus in this code editor
okay
so first of all we'll create a new file
we'll go to file and click on this new
file
now in order to save this one we can
click on control s or we can go over
here and click on this save as
now we can select the location
like
let's keep it over here only
let's name it as
visual
dot cpp
dot cpp is the extension which is used
when we want to do a program in c plus
plus
now we'll click on this save button
now let's do a simple program to check
whether the program is running on this
code editor or not
so we'll include the header files
let's include iostream
now we'll write namespace standard
now we'll write int main
now inside intman will display a message
welcome to this video
okay now return zero
make sure to
save this after making changes or you
can click on control s
or you can go to file
and click on this save
so once you have saved the program now
you can run it
we can click on this play button it will
run the code
as we can see in the output
welcome to this video we can see
here it is so
it means our program is working it is
running fine
now let's do another example in which we
will take the inputs from the user
so let's make a new file
we'll go to file and click on this new
file
now
we'll save as
and we'll write
visual
2 dot cpp
all right in this program we'll take the
input from the user
so start with
header files hash include iostream
our spelling is wrong
hash include iostream after that
using namespace standard
now inside int main
will take the inputs from the user
will display the message
enter the
first
number
now using c in
we'll take the input
we forgot to mention this
declare this n1 variable so
write int n1
and n2
and int
sum equals 0.
all right here we have taken the input
of n1 the first number
now we'll take the input of another
number
by displaying the message
enter the second number
we'll write n2
now we'll
add both of these
and 1 plus
n2
and will display the result
we'll write n line
so that it looks good
all right now we need to save it
we'll go to file
and click on this save
now it is saved now we can run this
program
we will click on this run code
now in order to write the first number
over here that is in order to write in
the terminal we have to configure the
visual studio code and to do that
we'll go to file
and we'll now go to preference
and in the settings we'll click on the
settings
and here we will type run in terminal
all right now we can scroll down
and here we can see code runner run in
terminal in my via studio it is already
marked but you have to mark this if you
want to
write in terminal or enter the inputs in
the terminal
all right once you have marked this you
can
close it and
then you can control s that is save
and then you can
close the va studio and then open it
again
once you are done
now
let's try to run this
so now you will be able to write the
inputs
like let's say
4
the first number is 4
now the second number let's say
9
on addition it becomes 13 which is the
right answer
so these were some configurations that
you need to do if you want to run a
program of c plus in visual studio code
so as we have understood how to download
and configure visual studio code for c
plus programs so let's move on to learn
how we can download dev c plus plus and
run c plus programs in
that so let's go to google
and type dev c plus plus
this is the first link
we'll click on that now this is the
green button
saying download will click on that to
download devc plus
as you can see it is getting downloaded
your download will start shortly
so now we'll click on download now
now it is getting downloaded
it will take a while the size of this
file is 48.1 mb
so as you can see the downloading is
almost done
so the downloading is complete now we'll
click on open folder
here it is dev c plus plus setup
now we'll click on this
setup
we'll click on yes
the setup is loading
now here we will select the preferred
language it is english we'll click on ok
now
we'll click on this is the license
agreement we'll click on i agree
now
we'll click on next
we don't need to change this i think the
space required is
346.8 mb
and we'll click on next
now if you want to change the
destination folder you can
but i don't want to change it so i'll
click on install
now it is getting installed
it will take a while
it's done and now we'll click on finish
and it is marked
so when we click on finish it will
launch the dev c plus
so here we have to select the language
it is english so we'll click on next
here again we'll click on next and now
we'll click on ok
so this is our code editor that is dev c
plus plus
so let's write a code
first of all let's create a file
we'll go to file and go to new and we'll
click on source file
all right now we need to save this one
and in order to save this we'll click on
file then we'll go to save as
and now we'll select the destination
and name it as
dev dot cpp
all right now let's start
with the header file
hash include iostream
we'll do a simple program over here
using namespace
std
because we want to check
that whether the program is running in
this editor or not
name space std
now we'll write int main
inside into main will
display a message
welcome
to
dev
c plus
all right after that we'll write return
zero
now let's try to run this
and in order to run this program we'll
go to execute
and now we'll click on compile and run
here this is the pop-up welcome to dev c
plus plus as we can see this is the
output
now press any key to continue it will
close this window
so our output is correct welcome to dev
c plus plus so this is how you can run a
program in dev c plus
and
our program was also working fine in the
visual studio code
so this is how you can download both of
these code editors to run the c plus
programs loops in c
so let's begin and see what's in it for
you
so we are gonna be learning today about
why loops
what is a loop
then different types of loops like for
loop while loop do while loop then there
is nested loop
after that there are control flow
statements like break and continue
but before we begin if you are new here
and haven't subscribed already make sure
to hit the subscribe button and the bell
icon for interesting tech videos
so let's start with the first topic that
is while loops
in order to perform a particular task or
operation many number of times we need
loops
these are used when we want to execute a
block of statement repeatedly rather
than just writing those statements again
and again
for example imagine you want to display
your name on the screen 50 times
now to do that there are two methods
method 1 is writing your name 50 times
by doing the hard code
and method 2 is writing your name once
with the loop condition and your name
will be automatically displayed 50 times
now it is pretty obvious that you would
prefer the second approach
because you don't have to put effort in
writing your name 50 times plus it is
easy to write code in few lines
so method two is the functionality of
loop
it reduces time in writing the code plus
it increases the simplicity
now let's understand what is a loop
loops in computer programming is a
series of tasks that are used to run
some particular code repeatedly until a
specific condition is met
loops tells the computer when to start
the condition and when to stop it
now this is a basic flow of a loop
after the initialization the condition
is checked if it's true then the blog of
statement will get executed as long as
the condition is true and if the
condition is false the loop will
terminate
depending on the program different types
of loops are used in different times
so let's first see different types of
loops
first is for loop
then while loop then there is do while
loop after that there is nested loop
these are four types of loops in c plus
plus so let's discuss these loops
first is for loop it is a repetition
control structure that is used to
iterate a piece of code based on the
condition is true or false if the
condition is true the statement inside
the loop body is executed and once if it
returns false the execution of statement
will get terminated
and after every execution of for loop
the increment on decrement parts will
update the loop counter
now let's move on to the while loop
in this loop the condition is evaluated
first if it's true then the set of
instructions inside the loop body will
execute and this will happen repeatedly
until the condition becomes false
and when it becomes false the loop will
end
now the main difference is we use for
loops when we know the number of times
the body of the loop needs to run
whereas we use while loops when we don't
know the accurate number of times the
body of loop needs to run
now moving to the next loop that is do
while loop
this loop is quite similar to the while
loop in this the loop will execute the
set of instructions once before checking
if the condition is true
after that it will repeat the loop as
long as the condition is true
that means
in do while loop body will execute at
least once irrespective of the test
condition now coming to the nested loop
when one loop is defined inside the body
of another loop then it is known as
nested loop
in c plus plus there are at least 256
levels of nesting
and the flow of execution for nested
loop is first it includes initialization
of variable followed by condition one if
it gets satisfied then it will search
for the second condition if that also
gets satisfied then it will get
increment and when the condition gets
satisfied it will search for the new set
of statements
and follows the same flow of execution
now coming to the control flow
statements
first is break statement it is basically
used to come out of the loop instantly
whenever a break statement is
encountered inside the loop the control
directly comes out from the loop by
terminating it
basically break statements are used when
we are not sure about the number of
iterations or we want the loop to end on
some condition
now we will discuss about continue
statement
continue is also a loop control
statement it is used to skip the current
iteration of the loop and control of
program goes to the next iteration
in other words if continue is mentioned
inside the loop it skips the current
statement and transfer the control to
execute the next citation of the loop
now as we have discussed these topics
let's do some examples to understand
them better in our code editor that is

now we'll make a new file
and we'll name that file as
loops dot cpp
okay
oops1.cpp
now here we will do a program in which
we have to print the digits from 0 to 10
using for loops
it will be a basic program just to
understand it
write the header file
hash include iostream
now i will write using namespace
standard
now here is the int name
now we will write the for loop with a
for keyword
inside the for loop
we'll initialize i with 0
now we'll put a condition i less than
equal to 10
which means
the loop will keep on executing until i
is less than 10.
now
we'll put increment i plus plus
now inside the loop brackets all we have
to do is to print i
so that all the digits
get printed
so now let me tell you here what we are
doing is
we are just making the loop to run from
0 to 10 as we can see that i have made i
0
to i less than equal to 10 that means
loop will move from i 0 to 10.
now let's try to run it
here we can see
all the digits zero one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten
here is our answer and
let me tell you one thing more to put
return 0
after the loop it's a good practice
now i'll again run it
the output will be the same but it's a
good practice to write return zero in
the end
zero one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten
so instead of writing the hard code we
can just use the for loop in this case
it's a basic example of for loop but you
can try some more examples in order to
understand it better
now let's do one example of while loop
to understand it better
we'll be doing a basic example of while
loop in which all we have to do is to
print happy new year 11 times
let's start
first of all let's name this file
loops2.cpp
now let's start with the header file
that is hash include iostream
now we will write using namespace
standard
now here is the main
now first of all we'll declare n equals
zero we'll take a variable n and
initialize it with zero
now we'll put the while condition with
the while keyword writing while
n
not equal to 11.
here what it means is
the loop will keep on executing until n
becomes
equal to 11
now here all we have to do is to print
happy new year so that it will get
printed along with the loop 11 times
and
now we'll write n plus
we have written n plus plus so that the
loop will keep on incrementing every
single time
after that now we'll write return 0
outside the loop
now we'll try to run this
so here's our output
happy new year 11 times so this is how
it's done
this is again a basic example of while
loop but to understand it better one
must practice some more examples on it
now let's do one example of do while
loop also
let's make a new file
first of all let's name that file
loops three dot cpp
i think the name is already taken
then we'll write loops for dot cpp
okay now so we'll write the header file
first of all
we'll write
hash include iostream
after that using namespace standard
now in this program all we have to do is
we have to print the sum of all the
digits from zero to nine
so let's start
we'll write in
so now let's first of all declare a
counting variable sum and initialize it
with zero
now we will initialize another variable
i
with 0.
now the syntax of do while loop is
do keyword
and now we will add some code inside the
body
we'll write
sum equals sum plus i
here what we are doing is we are simply
adding some variable
and i variable and storing it to some
variable itself
we are doing this because we want to
find the sum
that is why we have to store it in a
single variable
now we will need to increment i or else
loop is going to run forever
now we will write file
i less than 10 we have
written i less than 10 because we want
to find the sum from 0 to 9
and make sure to put a semicolon in the
end in case of do while loop
now we will print
some
in this while loop
will write sum is
some variable
now this loop will keep on executing
till i is less than 10.
now in the do while loop sum is
calculated by repeated addition and
increment in each repetition it is
checked whether the number i is smaller
or equal to the inputted number
if it is smaller then the loop continues
but exits the loop if it isn't
after the control exits from the loop
sum is printed
now let's try to run this code
here it is
sum is 45
which is the right answer this is our
output
so
this is how
it is done in two while loop
so now let's do one example of our last
loop that is nested loop
first of all we'll name the file
loops
pipe dot cpp
now we'll start with the header files
now using namespace standard
now in this program all we have to do is
to print a star pattern of half pyramid
form
using nested loop
so let's try
we'll write in
now let's initialize two variables that
is i
and j
now let's say we want to make a half
ramid of 10 rows
then it means we need to run a loop
which runs for 10 times
so let's write
or
initialize it to 0
i less than
10
i plus plus
now here we have written i less than 10.
instead of this we will write i less
than equal to 10 because we want this
tenth row to be printed also
now we will print slash n
in order to insert a new line
now we'll write another for loop
which will decide
number of stars in a particular row
so we'll write j equal to 1
because
this for loop is for the column section
then j less than equal to i
which is a row
then g plus plus
now we'll print
star
now one more thing instead of 0 we'll
write i equals to 1
because we want to print stars from 1 to
10
so now let's discuss it's working
initially we have i equals to 1 that is
the outer loop value
now for this value a complete run of jth
loop is happening
that is j equal to 1 validated by j less
than equal to i
now this condition is used because the
pattern which we are going to build is
having increment of star as the number
of rows increments
so for i equals to 1
j equals to 1 is executed
then j plus plus is done
which increments the value of j to 2
now j equals to 2 failed to execute as 2
is less than equal to 1 is false
therefore only 1 star is printed
[Music]
again we go to ith loop now for i equal
to 2 we'll check every value of j which
can be executed that is 1 and 2
since only two values can be true
therefore 2 star are printed
similarly we check for i equal to 3 4 5
and so on till 9 as we have the
condition i is less than 10
so now we'll try to run this
and check
whether the pattern is printing or not
here it is
half pyramid form using stars with the
help of
nested loops
so this is our star pattern
we can make some more different types of
patterns using nested loops
but we have done only one example in
order to understand the concept
so now let's move to our control flow
statements
and let's do some examples of them
okay now
make a new file
and let's name this file as
control 1
dot cpp
now we'll write the header file and the
name space standard as we have done
previously
so let's do it
dash include
live stream
using namespace std
now here
we will write a program in which we have
to print the numbers from 100 to 200
like 110 120 130 with a gap of 10
but after 150 we will terminate the
ongoing loop
now how can it be done with the help of
break statement
so let's start
first of all we'll write intermittent
now we'll take a variable num
and initialize it with hundred
now we'll write a while condition
and we'll write num is less than equal
to 200 because we want the loop to run
from 100 to 200.
num less than equal to 200
now we'll simply display those numbers
now we'll write an if condition that if
num equals 150
then we'll terminate the loop and for
that we have to write the break
statement inside the if statement
so let's write
if num equals equals 150
then we have to break
the loop
write the break statement
now after that we'll increment this
by 10
we're incrementing this by 10 because we
want
the numbers to be printed like 100 110
120 like this
that is why we are incrementing it with
10 and not with one
now we'll write out of the loop
just to be informed that we are finally
out of the loop
return 0
now we'll try to run this
here we can see yeah here we can see 110
120
up to 150 after that we are out of the
loop
this means
the code works fine
so this is the example of a break
statement
now after this we'll do another example
of
continue
so let's start
let's make a new file
and name it
ctrl 2 dot cpv
now we'll write the header files
[Music]
using namespace standard
now in this program all we have to do is
to print the numbers from 100 to 90
only excluding 96 from them
now how do we do it with the help of
continue statement
so let's start first of all we'll write
into main
now we'll declare a variable
num and initialize it with hundred
now we'll write a while condition
while loop in which we write the
condition
num greater than equal to
90 because we want the loop to run till
it is equal to 90
that is why we have wrote greater than
equal to 90 basically we want the loop
to run from 100 till it becomes equal to
90.
now inside the loop we'll write the if
condition
in order to skip 96
so we'll write
if
num equals 96 num
quilts equals 96.
now we'll use a decrement operator
because our starting point is 100 our
ending point is 90 that is why we have
to use the decrement operator
now continue statement
after that
write
value is
and we'll write the variable number
now we'll write num minus minus
here we are writing minus minus because
we want it to get decrement after
printing also
that is why we have written num minus
minus after printing num
now let's try to run this also hope it
works
okay i think there are some errors
so
[Music]
some brackets were missing
and we'll write return zero
now we'll try to run it
here it is
as you can see
199.98 97
but 96 is missing
so this is all we have to do in this
program and this is the basic example of
continue statement
in order to understand these examples
better you must try more examples on
each of these loops and control flow
statements so that it will be easier for
you all c plus plus array so without
further ado let's get started
so what's in it for you
we will start by understanding why do we
need arrays then what is an array
after that types of array like one
dimension array two dimension array
multi-dimensional array and then memory
representation and lastly we'll go
through our initialization
so first is need of arrays
we use arrays because it allows us to
store similar type of data within
contagious block of memory
and it allows us to iterate through
those variables conveniently using
indexing
usually an array is used to store
similar kind of data like marks code by
all the students of a class and record
of attendance of all the employees in an
organization
now moving to what is an array
an array can be defined as a collection
of similar kind of elements these are
always stored in contiguous memory
locations that is one after the other
the total number of elements in an array
is called the length of the array
now this is the way you can visualize
the n array
here each block is capable of storing
data values of some type in sequential
manner
and each element can uniquely identify
by its index in the array
and this is the syntax of array
int is the data type
array is the array name and 5 is the
size of array
now there are few types of variant c
plus plus
those are
one dimensional array two dimensional
array and multi-dimensional array so
let's first of all discuss one d array
this is the simplest form of an array in
this array data items are arranged
linearly in one dimension having single
index value to represent data elements
now this is the syntax of 1d array type
is the data type then there is array
name and after that size of array
and this is example of one dimensional
array
now coming to its memory representation
here we can see 2 7 4 8 1 6 are the
elements inside the memory blocks
and 0 1 2 3 4 5 are the indexes
so by using index we can easily access
the elements and once the array elements
are accessed a number of operations can
be performed
here area of 0 means 2 and array 1 means
7 and so on
as each element is of type int
that is 2 byte
that means the array occupies 12
contiguous bytes because each block
contain two byte and there are total six
blocks
now coming to the two dimensional array
in this array each element is referred
by two indexes that is rows and columns
and they are stored in the form of
matrices
the first index shows a row of the
matrix and the second index shows the
column of the matrix
now moving to its memory representation
as you can see this is a 2d array with
three rows and three columns
and we can also say that these are
basically three 1d array containing
three blocks each
combined to form a 2d array in the form
of a matrix with size of three cross
three
the horizontal lines step its rows and
the vertical lines tap its columns
and we know that index starts from zero
so first elements get stored at array
zero zero that is zeroth row and zero
column
then second element is stored at array
zero one that is zeroth row and column
one and likewise all the elements are
stored in the array
now coming to the multi-dimensional
array
these are defined as area of arrays that
means each element of multi-dimension
array is an array itself
they can have any number of dimensions
and it stores the data in tabular form
a two-dimensional array is also a
multi-dimensional array
and this is the syntax for a
multi-dimensional array
here type is the data type of array then
array name is the name of the array and
size 1 size 2 up to so on size n are the
dimension of sizes
after that this is the basic example of
a multi-dimensional array
now coming to the next topic that is air
initialization
so there are two ways to initialize an
array in c plus plus
first is you can initialize an array
when you declare it by including the
initial values in braces after the
declaration
while declaring we could use curly
braces to set the values inside it
for example in this array of size 6 the
element 2 is at 0 index
5 is at 1 index 1 is at 2 index and so
on
if we don't mention the size of array
then the array will only be large enough
to hold the elements added within the
curly braces
other than this we can set the value
after the declaration by assigning the
element to the array using its index
like array of 0 equal to 5
here we are assigning 5 to index 0 and
array of 1 equal to 7 here we are
assigning 7 to index 1 and same goes for
the array of 2.
now let's do some examples on array to
understand them better we'll do these
examples on our code editor that is vs
code
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
now we'll make a new file
and let's name that file as
array.cpp
array1.cpp
now we'll do a basic example in which we
have to print
the elements of array
so let's start first of all we'll write
the header file
[Music]
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
[Music]
i will write into main
now we'll start by writing the data type
int
now we'll write the array name that is
let's say coupon
and
now the size of array
let's say 6
now
curly braces now inside these curly
braces will write those elements
let's say 5
8
7
3
9
[Music]
1.
so these are those elements and this is
a
array declaration
now
here int means the data type coupon is
the array name 6 is the size of array
and 5 8 7 3 9 1 are the elements of
array
now after that
we'll write the for loop with 4 keyword
now we'll initialize i
with 0.
i less than 6 because it is the size of
array
now we'll increment i
now in this loop all we have to do is to
print this array
so how do we do that
so let's do
c out
and inside the bracket we'll write i
so here we have printed the array inside
the loop and we have put i inside the
array bracket
now the loop will run from i 0 to 6 and
likewise all the elements from 5 to 1
will get printed so let's see
let's try to learn this code
so this is our output
5 8 7 3 9 1
so this is how we can print the elements
of an array
and if we want to print a particular
element from the array all we have to do
is to write the index number of that
element inside the bracket
let's say if we want to print 7
[Music]
all we have to do is to print its index
number that is 2.
now let's run this
see
777 it is because of the loop
that from i 0 to i 6 that is why it is
getting printed six times
now if we remove the loop and try to
print it then it will get print only one
time
let's see
here 7
and this is what we want to print
now let's do another example
let's name this file
array2 dot cbd
now in this example all we have to do is
to do the sum of all the elements of the
error
so let's start by writing our header
file
dash include iostream
[Music]
now using namespace std
now we'll write into main
now here first of all we'll declare a
variable sum and initialize it with zero
[Music]
now we'll declare another variable n
and n will depict the size of the array
so first of all in order to scan array
first of all we have to scan the size of
it
so we'll scan n
[Music]
now we'll declare the error
[Music]
and inside the bracket we will mention n
because it is the size
[Music]
now we'll write for loop
and we will initialize with i equals 0
i less than n which is the size of array
and will increment i plus plus
we are writing for loop here because we
want to scan the array and as in this
array there are more than one element so
that is why we need
for loops
so now we will scan the error
we'll write c in
the name of array
and inside the bracket we'll write i
now here we have written i inside the
brackets because we want to take input
of elements from i equal to 0 to n which
is the size of error
now
we'll take another for loop
now here we will write another for loop
in which we are initializing i from 0 to
n
and inside that for loop we will do the
sum of the array
so we'll write
equals to 0
[Music]
i less than n which is the size
now we will implement i plus plus
now inside this for loop
we'll do the code we'll do the logic of
adding the elements of the array
we'll write sum
as we know that we have already
initialized sum with 0 we'll write sum
equals to sum
plus
array of 5
now for this statement sum equals to sum
plus area of i we are adding each value
in the array one by one into the sum
which is initially zero
when i equals to zero then the sum will
be equal to zero plus array of zero
and this sum will keep on getting stored
inside the variable sum
as our i increments our sum keeps on
storing the addition value
now
we'll print this sum
outside the loop
we'll write c out
and we'll write sum is
[Music]
now we'll write the sum variable
return
zero
let me tell you return zero is optional
in c plus
basically return value is exit status of
the program and 0 is considered as ok
in c plus compiler includes it
automatically but it's a good practice
here we forget to write the data type
now we'll try to run it
[Music]
so first of all we'll write the size
like
let's say six
now the elements of the array
let's say one
two
three
four
5
and 6.
now we want to find the sum of these
elements
sum is 21 let's recheck
1 plus 2 equals to 3 3 plus 3 equals 6
6 plus 4 10
10 plus 5 15 15 and 6 is 21 so this is
our right answer
so this is another basic example of
array
so after this we'll do one example of
two dimensionary also
so let's make a new file
and we'll write the header file
let's name this file as
array3.cpp
now namespace standard
now we'll write into main
now we will declare a 2d array of three
rows and three columns with elements
inside it
three rows
and second bracket will write three
columns
now we'll write the curly braces
and
another curly braces
this is the way to declare
a 2d array
now two
seven
nine let's say
now again curly braces
one
three
eight because we are creating a
matrix of 3 cross 3
that is why there are total 9 elements
inside the array
so now we will create a nested for loop
where the outer loop i which is for the
rows of matrix is initialized from zero
to two
we'll write
in i equal to zero
now i less than three
i
plus plus increment
now we will write inner for loop j which
is for the column and we will initialize
it from 0 to 2 as well
we'll write 4
and j 0
j less than three
j plus plus
now we will print the array
in the first bracket we will mention i
that is the number of rows and in the
second bracket we will mention j that is
number of columns
and in order to add space
we will add
space in the output
now
outside the bracket we will mention
handle
shift the elements to the next line
after that we'll write it in 0.
so this is our output 541279138
in the matrix form that is why i have
used this space to make the output look
good and this handle
so this is our output five four one two
seven nine one three eight
so this is how we can print the elements
of a multi-dimensional array for
two-dimensional array
these were some basic examples of array
and in order to understand these
programs you must practice more examples
on it c plus plus functions so let's go
ahead and look what's in it for us
first we will discuss what is a function
then we will understand why we use
functions
then types of functions like built-in
function and user defined function
then function declaration
after that function calling
then function call methods and at last
we have recursion
also don't forget to subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update
moving on to the first topic that is
what is a function
functions are blocks of code that are
designed to perform a specific task
it basically divides the complex problem
into smaller portions and make the
program easy to understand and reusable
and by reusable it means we can define
the code once and we can use it many
times
we can also pass data into the functions
in the form of parameters
and this is the syntax
first is return type of the function
then we will write function name
then inside the bracket
these are the parameters
now let's discuss why we use functions
functions make the program less
complicated because once function is
defined in the program then it can be
used over and over again
which reduces the complexity of code
and it helps in avoiding the duplicity
of code and it reduces the amount of
code
due to this we can easily debug and
maintain the code
now coming to the types of functions
there are two types of functions in c
plus plus
that is built in functions and user
defined function
now let's discuss these functions
first is built-in function
these are also known as predefined
functions or library functions
we don't need to define these functions
because these are already present in c
plus plus libraries and the
implementation of these functions are
also available in library file
and to use these functions we don't have
to write them separately we simply call
them
now coming to the user defined functions
c plus plus allows us to define our own
functions these functions are created by
programmers according to their
requirement
this allows a way to wrap a set of
statements to perform a specific task
and that group of statement is given a
name so that it can be invoked later
from any part of the program
following is the example of user defined
function
here club is a user defined function
with the return type wired and it is
being called from the main function
now
let's learn about function declaration
function declaration basically acts as
an identification for the function
it informs the compiler about the
existence of function
function's name
the number of parameters in the function
and its return type
these things acts as an identifier for a
function
and this is the syntax for a function
declaration
first we will write the return type then
we will write the name of the function
after that inside the bracket we will
write the number of parameters
for example in this chess function int
is the return type chess is the name of
the function
and inside the brackets these are the
number of parameters
although we can write the names of
parameters but names of parameters are
not important in the function
declaration only their type is required
now let's learn about function calling
in order to use a function we'll have to
invoke or call a function
when a program calls a function the
control of the program is transferred to
the called function and when the call
function completes its task then the
control is returned back to the main
program
so the functions are called by writing
the name of function and after that
writing the required parameters inside
the brackets
and this is the syntax
first we will write the function name
and after that we will write the
arguments which you want to pass
for example sum is the function name and
a and b are the arguments
now coming to the function call methods
now if the function is without any
arguments then it can be called directly
but if there are arguments within a
function then there are basically two
ways to call a function
one is call by value and another one is
call by reference
in call by value we pass the copies of
values of arguments into the formal
parameters of the function
hence the original value of arguments
remains unchanged and only the
parameters inside the function changes
and in call by reference we pass the
reference or address as arguments inside
the formal parameters inside the
function
so any change inside the function will
be reflected to the original arguments
because here we are not sending any
copies of arguments but we are sending
the address of the variable as arguments
so these were the two methods
now coming to the last topic that is
recursion when a function calls itself
again and again until a specific
condition is met then it is known as
recursive function
and the technique is known as recursion
this enables the function to repeat
itself several times and it gives out
the result at the end of each iteration
and this is the basic syntax example in
which the function name recursion is
being called by itself
now let's do some examples on it to
understand functions in a better way
we'll do the examples on our code editor
that is vs code
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
now here we will do a program in which
we have to do the sum of two integers
with the help of function
so let's first of all
make a new file
function dot cpp
okay so let's start first of all we'll
declare the header files
that is hash include iostream
now the name space standard
now we will write int main
now inside end main we will declare a
variable named s
here we have declared this variable
because we want to store the sum of
those two integers in this variable
so
[Music]
we'll call the function let's say let's
name the function as sum
and let's
assume the variables to be 5 and
5
here sum is the name of the function and
5 comma 5 are the arguments
now we'll make the function sum
here end
is the return type
sum is the name
and
paint a
comment b
are the parameters
so in this function we'll write the code
to do the sum of these two integers and
for that we have to store the sum in a
variable
for that we will now declare a variable
c
now we will write
c equals
a plus b
here we are storing the sum of a plus b
into the variable c
now as we know that the return type
isn't so we have to return the variable
instead of printing it
will write
return
c
now in the main function
we'll print that variable
we will print the variable s
because after the function completes its
task of addition the output will come
back to the calling function which is
getting stored in the variable
s so
we'll write
the result is
now we will write the variable s
let's see
hope it runs
the result is 10
5 plus 5 on addition we'll get 10
let's write
3
and again
try to run this
the result is 8
5 plus 3 equals to 8 so this is the
right answer
now we will do another example
of c plus function
in which we have to find the larger
number or greater number among two
elements
so let's do that
let's create a new file
function1.cpp
now we will include the header files
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
now first of all we'll write the intent
now the variable n1
now we will declare another variable n2
these are the two variables among which
we have to find the greater number
so
we'll display a message saying that
enter
the first number
now we'll take the input
and one
now we'll do the same for the other one
we'll write
enter the second number
we'll input the second number
now
we have to make a call to the function
named let's say
maxi
and we will pass these arguments
n1 comma n2
now let's make this function maxi
the return type is void
maxi
is the name
we'll write the variables n1
and 2.
now we'll write the if condition because
we have to find the greater number among
both these elements so we'll write the
if condition
if
n1 is greater than n2
then it must print the unwanted
will also display a message saying that
the larger number is
n1
if n1 is greater than n2 then we'll
display the n1
and
if n2 is greater
then we'll display the n2
we'll write the variable n2
so let's see if that runs or not
i think we have to write the first
number here we can see enter the first
number
enter the first number
so
we'll write let's say
56
and
the second number would be
78
the larger number is 78
so
among both the numbers as we know that
70's is greater than 56 so this is how
we can show it with the help of
functions
so these were some basic examples of c
plus plus functions in order to
understand it better you must practice
more examples on it
why we need oops then what is object
oriented programming
then we will discuss the difference
between oops and procedural programming
then we'll go through basic concepts of
oops and at last we will learn about the
benefits of hoops
but before moving forward make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
now let's move on to our first topic
that is why oops
well there were some limitations in
earlier approaches to programming
and oops help to fill those gaps
in object oriented programming it is
easy to maintain the code with the help
of classes and objects
and with the help of inheritance there
is code reusability that is we don't
have to write the same code again and
again which increases the simplicity of
the program
now let's understand what is object
oriented programming
object oriented programming is a
programming pattern where the programs
are structured around objects rather
than logic and functions
in other words we basically focus on
objects that are required to be
manipulated instead of logic
for example let us suppose we have made
blueprint of a mall then that blueprint
will be a plan that explains what
properties the mall should have and how
it should look like etc
but it is just a blueprint of them all
we cannot go inside it physically as of
now
now the constructors will go through the
blueprint and they will construct them
all and they can make as many malls as
they want with the help of that
blueprint and each mall can have its own
different shops and showrooms
in this case blueprint is the class
the mall is the object and the show ups
and showrooms inside the malls are data
stored in the object's properties
and these are some basic concepts of
oops
first is classes then objects then data
abstraction and encapsulation then there
is inheritance polymorphism dynamic
binding and message passing we will
learn about these concepts later first
we will discuss the difference between
oops versus procedural programming
procedural programming follows top down
approach here tope down approach means
fragmenting a bigger complication into
smaller chunks
oops follows bottom-up approach and
bottom-up approach means
piecing together smaller tasks to give
rise to complex tasks
in procedural programming overloading is
not possible
in oops overloading can be done
in procedural oriented programming there
are no access specifiers in oop
they have access specifiers like private
protected public
procedural oriented programming is less
secure
oops is more secure because of the
concepts like abstraction and
encapsulation which are used for data
hiding
now
let's learn the basic concepts of oops
first is class
class can be defined as collection of
objects it is a logical entity
then there is object
it is defined as an entity that has
state and behavior or in other words
anything that exists physically in the
world is called an object
inheritance can be defined as when one
object acquires properties and behavior
from its parent class
it provides code usability
polymorphism polymorphism is a
combination of two words poly which
means many and morphs which means forms
it is basically an ability to exist in
more than one form
next is abstraction
hiding the internal details and showing
the functionality to the user is called
abstraction
then encapsulation encapsulation is the
binding of code and data together into a
single unit
in dynamic binding dynamic binding is
the method called at runtime that means
which code will execute is unknown until
the program runs
then there is message passing
it is basically a communication that
exists between the objects
as we have gone through some concepts of
oops
now let's discuss some benefits of oops
in oops code can easily be reused with
the help of inheritance and object
we don't need to write the same code
over and over
second is with the help of abstraction
and encapsulation certain parts of
program can be hidden and it helps to
make a secure system
third is
maintaining and modification of code is
easy in object oriented programming
now to do some examples on concepts of
oops let's move on to our code editor
that is vs code
now here we will do a program of
inheritance in which we will make a
parent class and a child class and we
will call the attributes using object of
child class
so let's get started first of all
let's name the file
oop
dot cpp
okay so first of all we'll add the
header files
hash include
iostream
now adding namespace standard
now we will write int main
we want to create the object of side
class so first of all we'll write the
name of class child that is child
let's put c capital
child and now the name of the object ch
so now we will call the attributes using
this object
so we'll write first of all
display it so we'll write c out
ch
dot
name
1
which is the attribute
we will declare it later
so basically we want to write both the
names of both the classes together so
that is why
we are doing like this we'll write name
two
name one will be the attribute of the
parent class and name two will be the
attribute of child class
so after that we'll write
return zero
now
we'll make the parent class and the
child class so first of all let's write
class
parent we'll name it as parent
then we'll write public access specifier
string
is the data type
name
one
let's write
harley
okay now
it is mandatory to write the semicolon
at the end of the class
now
we'll write the derived class that is
child
we will write the column symbol
then we will write public
name of the parent class that is parent
so here we are writing
the child class is derived from the
parent class
now
within the bracket we'll
write public
then string the data type
name
to
will write ha davidson
it's a popular bike brand harley
davidson
so
now we'll write the semicolon over here
now we'll try to run this
[Music]
as you can see harley davidson
here harley is from the parent class and
davidson is from the child class
so as we can see that we are calling
from the object of child class and still
we are able to access the attribute of
parent class
so this shows that the child class
inherits attributes or properties from
the parent class
now as we have done one example of
inheritance
so now let's do one example of
polymorphism also
let's name it oop
one dot cpp
first of all we'll include the header
files
flash include iostream
stream
now we'll write using namespace standard
after that we'll write int main
now here we will do an example of
polymorphism in which we will make a
base class and its derived classes and
inside these classes we will override a
function which is common in all of these
classes
so let's start
first of all we'll write the name of the
parent class or base class
animal
and we'll make an object a
after that we'll write the name of the
child class jeeta
and its
object name is c let's say
now
another derived class dolphin
and we'll name the object as d
now while making these classes we'll
write a function name speed
in all of these classes inside all of
these classes and now in order to
override that function we'll call them
so
first of all we'll call it by the object
of animal that is a
a dot
speed
now c dot
speed
this is the object of cheetah class now
d dot
speed
after that we'll write return 0
now let's make these classes
first of all we will make the animal
class that is the base class
animal
now we'll write the access specifier
public
now we'll write the function
void that is the data type speed
now we will
display a message inside this function
let's say
it displays who is more faster
who
is
more
faster
okay
now
we'll put a semicolon in the end
now we will make a derived class that is
dolphin
we'll write class
dolphin
child of
animal
class
okay so now inside this class
we'll write public
and we'll make the same function speed
and we'll display a message
saying
as this class is of dolphin so
we'll write
i'm faster
in
water
we'll put semicolon
now we'll make
another child class
class
cheetah
okay c is capital cheetah
public
animal
now here we will write
public access specifier
and we'll write the same function wide
speed
and over here will display a message
saying that
i am
faster on the ground
semicolon
so now as we can see that a dot speed is
calling this speed function
in animal class
c dot speed is calling this
cheetah function
in cheetah class
and d dot speed
d dot speed is calling the dolphin
speed function in dolphin class
okay so now let's try to run this
[Music]
okay the output is here but it is not
in very good form so
let's put slash n in the end
okay
slash and
slash and
okay
here it is
so first who is faster is displayed then
i'm faster on the ground
then i'm faster in water
is displayed
so as we know that first of all we have
called the animal class so that is why
who is more faster is displayed after
that we have called the cheetah class
and cheetah says that i'm faster on the
ground then dolphin class then dolphin
says i am faster in water
so
here we can see that each of the class
have its different implementation for
the same function that is speed
and this is how polymorphism allows us
to do a single action in variety of ways
okay now let's do one example of
abstraction
let's name it as
oop
three dot cpp
first of all we'll include the header
files we'll write hash
include iostream
now we'll write the namespace standard
using namespace std
now as we know abstraction helps in data
hiding so in this program we will make a
variable named coupon as private and
with the help of set coupon function we
will try to assign some value to the
coupon variable
and after that we will display it
so let's start
first of all we'll write int main
now we'll write the name of the class
that is trade fair
trade
fair
and now the name of the object t
now with the help of this object we will
call a function named
set
coupon
i would say coupons
and we'll pass 50 as an argument to this
function
now
we'll display
a message
coupon
and after that
we will call getcoupon method in order
to display the number of coupons
so we'll write t dot
get
coupons
and
brackets
done
after that we'll write return zero
now let's make the class and the
functions
so let's start first of all
we'll write
class
trade fair
now we'll write an access specifier
private
and
i private
now
we will declare a variable coupon
and
as i've already told you we will make
this variable as private so that is why
we have used this access specifier as
private
now
after that we will
write public access specifier
to write a function
that is set coupons
set
coupons
and the parameter is c
as we know that we have passed 50 to
this
parameter
so
[Music]
now
we will write
the private variable coupon
equals c
so here we are basically assigning
the value of c to the coupon that is we
are assigning 50 to coupon
variable
now
after that
we will make another function
and
we'll put its data type as int because
it is returning something
so
we'll write and get coupon
and we will return
variable
coupon
now as the class ends we'll write
semicolon
now let's try to run this code
there is some error
okay we haven't write s over here
now let's again try to run it
coupon
50
as i have told you
so here we have assigned 50 to
this function and
the variable c is assigning
50 to the variable coupon
now after that we have used getcoupon
function to return the value of coupon
and that is why it is getting displayed
over here
so
we got our answer that is coupon 50.
and as you can see that in this example
we are not
allowed to access the variable coupon
but still somehow we have managed to do
that with the help of some functions
so this is an example of abstraction
and
it helps to increase the security of the
program
so this
these were some basic examples
of oops in c plus plus
in order to understand it better we must
practice some more examples on it
c plus plus inheritance so without
further ado let's get started so in this
session we will learn about what is c
plus plus inheritance why do we use
inheritance in c plus then we will
understand different modes of
inheritance and after that we will learn
about types of inheritance that is
single inheritance multiple inheritance
multilevel inheritance and hybrid
inheritance in c plus but before we
begin make sure to subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update so what is inheritance in
c plus just like a child inherits the
behavior and characteristics from his or
her parents similarly inheritance in c
plus plus is a process in which the
derived class acquires all the
properties and characteristics from the
parent class that is the base class
derived class is also known as child
class and base class is also known as
parent class
inheritance is one of the most important
feature of c plus plus hoops that is
object oriented programming in
inheritance there are two types of
classes the class which inherits the
properties and behavior from the base
class is known as derived class and the
class whose properties or
characteristics are inherited is called
a base class
now let's understand why we use
inheritance in c plus plus inheritance
is used in c plus plus because it
increases the reusability of the code
and it helps in removing the redundancy
to understand it let's suppose there are
two classes two wheeler and four wheeler
both of the classes contain similar
functions like color brand and mileage
now if we create these classes we have
to create all the three functions in
both of the classes or in other words we
have to write the same code two times in
both of the classes so instead of
writing that code again and again we can
use inheritance and create a parent
class named class michael and both of
the two wheeler and the four wheeler
classes will be inherited from this
parent or base class
now with inheritance we have inherited
both the classes from one base class
that is class cycle now we no longer
have to write the code again and again
and we can simply write the functions
once in the base class as both of these
classes are inherited from the base
class vehicle so as we have understood
about inheritance in c plus plus and why
we use inheritance in c plus plus so now
let's go ahead and learn about modes of
inheritance there are three modes of
inheritance in c plus plus that is
public mode protected mode and private
mode of inheritance so let's start with
the public mode in this mode of
inheritance the public members of base
class remains public in derived class
and same goes for the protected members
that means inside the base class the
class members that are public will
remain public in the derived class and
similarly protected class members will
remain protected in derived class
now protected mode in the protected mode
the public and protected members of the
base class will become protected in the
derived class that means the class
members which are public or protected in
the base class will all become protected
in the derived class in the private mode
of inheritance protected and public
members of class will become private in
the derived class so now let's go ahead
to the types of inheritance so there are
various types of inheritance in c plus
plus that is single inheritance multiple
inheritance multi-level inheritance
hierarchical inheritance and hybrid
inheritance so let's start with the
single inheritance in this type of
inheritance a single derived class is
inherited from the single base class it
allows the derived class to inherit
properties and behavior from the parent
class the derived class objects can
access the members of the base class but
the base class objects cannot access the
members of the derived class so now
let's have a look at the syntax as we
know this is single inheritance so there
will be only a single derived class and
a single base class and this is how we
derive a child class from a parent class
class keyword then the name of the
derived class then the colon operator
after that there is an access modifier
with the base class now as we have
understood about single inheritance and
its syntax now let's move on to multiple
inheritance multiple inheritance when a
class inherits from more than one base
class or multiple base classes then it
is known as multiple inheritance it
allows us to inherit properties and
characteristics from more than one base
class
syntax for multiple inheritance is class
keyword with the name of derived class
then the colon operator and access
modifier with the name of the base class
separated with comma and the name of
another base class here we have shown
only two base classes but we can make
more than two base classes depending
upon our requirement now coming to
multi-level inheritance in this type of
inheritance the derived class is
inherited from another derived class
that means when a class extends a class
that further extends another class is
known as multi-level inheritance for
example if there are three classes a b c
and class c is inherited from class b
and class b is inherited from class a
then it can be called as a multi-level
inheritance syntax of multi-level
inheritance is as follows base class 2
is derived from base class 1 and the
derived class is derived from base class
2. these base class 1 base class 2 and
derived class are just the names not a
syntax you can write whichever name you
want with the class now let's learn
about hierarchical inheritance in this
type of inheritance more than one class
is inherited from a single base class
that is there would be a single base
class and multiple derived classes
which have the properties and features
same as that of the base class as we can
see in the figure and in the syntax the
derived class 1 is derived from base
class and similarly derived class 2 and
derived class 3 are also derived from
the base class
so this was hierarchical inheritance and
our next type of inheritance would be
hybrid inheritance the hybrid
inheritance is the combination of more
than one type of inheritance and it can
be said that it is a combination of
multi-level and hierarchical inheritance
in the figure we can see the base class
1 is the parent class of derived class 1
and derived class 1 is the parent class
of derived class 3 which makes it
multi-level inheritance but if you look
at it in this way that the base class 1
is the parent class of derived class 1
derived class 2 and derived class 3 then
it is hierarchical inheritance as
multiple classes are inherited from a
common base class so we can say it is a
combination of more than one type of
inheritance or a hybrid inheritance so
as we have understood about inheritance
in c plus so now let's go to its
practical aspect and do some examples on
our code editor that is vs code so this
is our visual studio code and now we
will do an example of inheritance we'll
start by doing the single inheritance
example in which we will make a parent
class and a child class and let's start
first of all we'll create a file and
let's name this file as
let's name it inherit
dot cpp
so here we'll do an example in which you
will create two classes a base class and
a derived class and will create
functions in those classes like we will
create one function in base class and
one function in derived class and using
the object of derived class we will
access the member of
parent class or base class so let's
start first of all we will include the
header files
hash include iostream
now the name space standard using name
space
std
now we'll create a base class first then
afterwards we'll create the main
function
all right so
let's create the base class
let's say the name of the base class or
the parent class would be beverage
and inside this class let's make the
scope public and
now let's create a function
as we have said
drinks
so this is a function and we will print
something inside this function so let's
say we are printing
uh all rings are available
all drinks
are available
now i will write endl now
we will use semicolon in the end of the
class so this is our base class and we
have created a function drinks and we
have printed a message all drinks are
available
all right now we will create another
class which is derived class or child
class
we will write
class
coffee is the
name of the derived class and use the
column operator public access specifier
and the name of
the base class that is beverage
all right now we'll write
public access specifier inside this
class and we will create a function in
this class also like let's say the name
of the function would be mocha
it is a kind of a coffee so mocha and
we will print
that
mokka tastes good
tastes the best i would say
okay
now
let's use the corn operator in the end
of the class
so here we have created the parent class
or base class and this derived class of
child class
so now we will create the main function
we will do the calling
so now we will create the object of
child class
so our child class is coffee
and
now we will create the object that is c
the name of the class and the object
okay now we will use the object with dot
operator and call this function that is
drinks
and now using the same object we will
call the
mocha the spelling is wrong yeah now it
is right
mocha
so using the object of child class here
we are calling the drinks function which
is of the parent class
so
let's see if it works or not
let's save it and now run it
as you can see all drinks are available
and mocha taste the best
both of these are getting printed that
means the
object of child class is able to access
the member of the parent class
so this is inheritance when the child
class
acquires or inherits the behavior or
characteristics from a parent class or
access the members of the parent class
this is an example of single inheritance
so now let's do another example of
multiple inheritance
so let's create a new file
and name it as inherit 2 dot cpp
all right now here we will do an example
of multiple inheritance in which we will
create two base classes and a derived
class as we know that in multiple
inheritance there are more than one base
classes to a single derived class
so let's start first of all we'll
include the header file
now we'll use the namespace standard
and now we will create a class that is
the base class
and we'll name it as party so class
party inside this base class we will
first of all declare the public scope
and now we will declare a variable let's
say meals
so now we will create a function and in
this function we will take the input
from the user about the number of meals
to enter the number of mails
so
let's start void
food this is the function name and first
of all we'll display the message
saying that
enter
number of meals
all right now
we will take the input
and meals
is the variable
now we will use the semicolon at the end
of this class
so in this
function we are taking the input of the
number of meals now in this in the other
class that is another base class
we will take the input of number of
drinks from the
users
and then in the derived class we figure
out the total bill of the party
all right now
we'll create another base class that is
drinks
not drinks
drinks
all right
now we'll write the public scope
and similarly we'll create
or declare another variable drink
and
then now we will create a function let's
say the name of the function is
liquor
all right now inside this function we
will take the input from the user
regarding the number of drinks
so
we'll display the message
enter
the number of
drinks so the user will enter the total
number of drinks used in the party or
consumed in the party similarly goes for
the meals now we will take the
input
and we'll write
drink
drink all right
now we have created this liquor function
now we will use the semicolon at the end
of the class here we have created both
the base classes that is class party and
class strings
now we have to create the derived class
so this is example of multiple
inheritance so
we will create
the derived class
and use the
column operator now we will write the
public specifier and the name of the
base class first base class would be
party
separated with comma the second base
class would be drinks
all right so this is how we can do that
now inside this class we will first of
all create three variables
let's say
hint
total
meals
in
total
drinks
and int
total
bill because in the end we have to find
out the total bill all right
now
inside the public scope
we will create a function
name as total
now inside this total function we'll
write the logic to calculate the total
bill
so what we'll do is first of all write
the total meal
total meals
equals
meals
into the price of a single meal let's
say the price of a single meal is 90.
so the total product would be stored in
total meals
all right now
we will do
same for total drinks total drinks not
frank's equals
drink
into
let's say the price of a single drink is
60
yes all right
now after that we have to compute or
calculate the total bill
total bill would be
the addition of both of these total
meals plus total rings so we'll simply
do the addition over here
total drinks
so once it's calculated we'll simply
display a message saying that the total
bill for the party
total
bill for the party is
and we'll write the variable that is
total bill
where the total
bill is actually getting stored all
right after this we will use the
semicolon so this is the derived class
here we have calculated the total money
spent in the party
so now we have to write the main
function where it all started
inside the main function
first of all we will create the
object of child class so we know that
our child class or the derived class is
bill
so bill is the derived class and b would
be the object so using this b we will
first of all call a function
that is
food function
so by calling this we will take the
input of number of meals now we will
call another function
named liquor
all right using this function calling
this function will take the number of
drinks from the user
now we will call
this total function
so this will calculate the total money
spent in the party
and after that let's say return 0.
we are calling all of these functions
using the object of derived class and
this is where multiple inheritance is
going on so let's see whether it works
or not we will save it and we'll try to
run this
enter number of meals as you can see
enter number of meals let's say the
number of meals would be 20 it was a
short party then enter number of drinks
17 would be so our total bill for the
party is three two seven zero which is
the correct answer so this is how we can
do multiple inheritance and this is a
fine example of multiple inheritance now
let's do another example so let's name
this one as
inherit three dot cpp
all right so here we will do an example
of multi-level inheritance and we know
that in multi-level inheritance a single
derived class is inherited from another
derived class
or in other words we can say a class
extends a class which further extends
another class then it is called a
multi-level inheritance as the name
suggests
so
we will do example of that in this
example we will calculate the marks of a
student scored by him in three subjects
we will calculate the total marks scored
by him uh using multi-level inheritance
so let's do this
so first of all we will
include the header file hash include i
stream then we will write the name space
standard
now we will create the class
base class
chemistry
all right in this class
first of all we will make the public
scope
and
marks one so here we will take the input
of marks code by that particular child
in this chemistry subject so we'll
create the chemistry function white
chemistry this is of same name as that
of class so let's take mystery marks
all right now we will display the marks
code in chemistry
enter the marks
scored in chemistry
spelling is wrong okay now we'll take
the input
marks one so the student will enter the
marks after that
let's put semicolon in the end now we'll
create another class named physics
which is inherited from chemistry class
that is chemistry class is its base
class
chemistry
all right so
in this class
we will do the same public
and
marks 2 print marks 2
now we'll write void
physics marks
we'll do the same as we have done in the
previous class
so now we will
display a message saying that enter the
marks
code in
physics
all right
now we will take the input c in
max2 all right so now we will put
semicolon in the end of this class as
well so now we know that this physics
class is is inherited from this
chemistry class that is the mystery
class is the base class of physics class
now
we'll do same for maths like class
maths
which is in
inherited
from the
physics class
we will write physics
inside this class as well we'll do the
same and as you can see this physics
class is the base class of maths and the
base class of physics class is chemistry
so this is a multi-level inheritance
so in this class we'll do the same
public scope and now after public scope
hint marks three is the variable we have
declared
and we will declare another variable in
this one like total because we have to
find out the total marks
now
function maths
marks
inside this one we will display the
message
that enter
the marks yeah enter
the
marks scored in
maths all right now we'll take the input
marks three and we'll write the
semicolon in the end
so here we have created all of these
three classes which is of multi-level
inheritance as you can see
we have taken the input from the
user of its maths physics and chemistry
marks
now
we'll do the total so
we have to do the total inside this
class only so the name would be
result function
so
the total
func variable that we have declared
is equal to marks one
marks two plus
marks three so physics commission maths
marks we will add all of them
and then we will display the total
all right
now this is done now we have to go to
the main function
now first of all we will create the
object of child class maths
once this object is created now we can
call the functions as it can access
the base classes
so
chemistry marks first of all
then m dot
physics
marks
m dot maths marks
and then the total that is result result
function m dot result
then we'll write return zero
so
return zero so here first of all m dot
chemistry marks will call this function
in the chemistry class so the user will
enter the marks code by him in chemistry
then this will call physics marks so the
user will enter the marks code by him in
physics subject then similarly we will
match marks they will enter the marks of
max then we will call the result
function we will do the total of all the
marks scored by the student
we will do the total and then we will
display that total so pretty much it's
done now we can save it and now let's
try to run this one there are some
errors
all right that's a silly one
by mistake we have done this
all right now let's save it and run it
again hope it works now yeah another
error
marks
now let's try again now it's working
fine enter the marks code in chemistry
let's say 80
physics
80
or math is weak let's say
75
235 which is the right answer 80 plus 80
plus 75 is equal to 235 and using the
object of child class we have all the
functions of all of these base classes
like we have called this chemistry marks
function and this physics marks function
which is of base class and this was a
fine example of multi-level inheritance
and this is how we can
do multi-level inheritance so these were
some examples of c plus plus inheritance
you can try some more examples on it and
these were some decent examples
to understand it better you can start
with some basic level examples then go
to the intermediate level c plus plus
polymorphism
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering
today so we'll start with what is
polymorphism in c plus plus then types
of polymorphism in c plus plus that is
compile time and runtime
we'll also study function overloading
and operator overloading under compile
time polymorphism
and under runtime polymorphism we will
learn about
function overriding and virtual function
in c plus
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
so what is polymorphism in c plus plus
polymorphism is an important topic of c
plus plus oops concept
the word polymorphism is derived from
two words that is poly which means many
and morphs which means forms so
basically it means many forms
polymorphism in c plus plus can be
defined as when the member function or
the object behaves differently in
different
situations or circumstances
then it can be called as polymorphism
for example
a mother has different relationships
with different family member inside the
house for example she is a parent to her
child
she is a wife to her husband she is a
sister to her brother and she is also a
daughter to her parents
so we can say a mother as a single
entity has different behavior among
different members
and same goes for polymorphism where
functions behave differently in
different situations
now
let's understand the types of
polymorphism
there are two types of polymorphism in c
plus plus that is compile time
polymorphism and runtime polymorphism
so let's start with compile time
polymorphism
as the name suggests
this type of polymorphism occurs during
the compile time and it is achieved by
overloading the function or overloading
the operator
that is by function overloading or
operator overloading
so what is this function overloading
function overloading is a feature in c
plus
where the functions having the same name
but different in terms of parameters or
type of parameters can be overloaded
for example as you can see two functions
with same name func
differ in the type of arguments
one data type is double another data
type is integer
so when we make a call to the function
with arguments of type double it will
invoke the suitable function and the
same goes for the other one
in example 2 there is a difference in
number of parameters
among functions
so while calling the function if we pass
two arguments it will invoke the first
function and if we will pass three
arguments then it will invoke the second
function
then
next is operator overloading
like functions operators can also be
overloaded
in operator overloading we can redefine
the functionality of the operator
it helps us in redefining the already
existing operator
for example
instead of writing sum equals
s1 dot add
s2 we can easily write
sum equals s1 plus s2
that is we can redefine the plus
operator and use it to add the numbers
in the operator function
and we will discuss the syntax of
operator overloading in the examples
now
coming to runtime polymorphism
in this type of polymorphism the
functions are invoked during the
execution of program
that is during runtime
this runtime polymorphism can be
achieved through function overriding
so let's understand this function
overriding
in function overriding the function of
the base class gets a new definition in
the derived class
in this more than one function has the
same name and same type of parameters
the only difference is in the definition
of both the functions
that is functions have different
definitions in the parent class and the
child class
as you can see in the example
void message function has a different
definition in the parent class and in
the child class
both have the same name
but in parent class it is printing hello
there and in child class it is printing
nice to meet you
by using the object of the base class or
derived class we can invoke the suitable
function
so let's move on to our next topic that
is virtual function
virtual function is also used to achieve
runtime polymorphism
it is a function that is defined in the
base class and then is redefined in the
derived class
the function is defined using the word
virtual in the base class and the name
of the function is same as that of the
derived class having different
definitions as shown
it tells the compiler to perform the
late binding on the function in derived
class
the function call is resolved at runtime
and in late binding
and the compiler determines the object
type at runtime
with the help of virtual function we can
invoke the derived version of the
function in the derived class
so as we have covered the theoretical
aspect of c plus polymorphism so let's
go ahead and cover the practical aspect
of this topic in our code editor that is
vs code if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so here we will make a new file
and let's name it as
poly1 dot cpp all right
poly1 dot cpp
let's save it so here we will do an
example of function overloading which is
used to achieve compile time
polymorphism
and we know function overloading is a
feature in c plus first in which two
functions have saved name
but differ in terms of parameters or
number of parameters or the type of
parameters can be overloaded so let's
start
first of all we'll write
the header file
hash include iostream
now using namespace standard
all right
so now we will create a class king and
inside that class we'll do the
overloading
so
the class name is king
and inside the class first of all
let's make public scope
now we'll create a function
return type is void
and the name of the function would be
pro
inside this function let's say we are
passing two arguments
hint a and b
all right now
we'll print both of these arguments
or variables inside this function
all right and we'll use ndl in the end
okay
after that we'll create another function
and the name of the function is same
that is pro
and but in this case we'll make the
arguments like int a
and b
and c
into d
and int e
so there are five arguments in this
function second function pro
as we know that the name of the function
is same
and now inside this function
will simply add all of these
so a plus b plus c plus d
plus
e
all right once we are done with this we
will use semicolon in the end of the
class
all right now we will start with the
main function inside the main function
all right inside the main function
we will create the object of king class
king and the object would be k
with the help of this object k
we will call these
functions
as we know the name of the functions are
same the only difference is in the
number of arguments
so
so i'll call the pro function
which accepts only two arguments
so the first pro
function
will be invoked
so i'll pass 10
and 20
so these two arguments will be passed
over here
all right
similarly
now we'll call the pro function again
but
now we'll pass five arguments
so that the second pro function would be
invoked
so let's say i'm passing
12
23
20
and
62
6
these are some random numbers
all right now return 0
in the end
now let's try to run this i think we are
done with this
first of all let's save it and now let's
right run this
so this is our output 10 20 let's make
it
let's multiply both of them
it will look good let's save it and run
it again
as you can see 200 and 123 so this is
our output
10 into 20 would become 200 and if we
add all of these we'll get 123 so this
is our correct output so this was the
example of function overloading and
let's start with another example
so now let's create a new file
and name this file as
only 2 dot cpp
all right we have saved it
now here we will do an example of
operator overloading as we know that in
operator of loading we give definition
to already existing operators
or we can say we can redefine the
functionality of already existing
operators
so let's start
first of all we'll include the header
files as we have done previously
hash include iostream
then the name space standard
so first of all we'll start with the
main function
and inside the main function
we will
write the name of the class that we will
create
and
the object let's say the name of the
object is one
and
will pass
the arguments to the constructor
let's say the argument is six and eight
all right
then i think we can write return zero
and we'll do the rest
afterwards first of all we will
create the class
so as we know that the name of the class
is overload so let's create it
class
overload
and inside this class
inside the private scope
we'll start with
the variables let's say the first
variable is n1
and
let's declare another variable n2
then we will create the public scope
inside this we will create the
parameterized constructor
so
it is of same name as that of the class
that is overload
and now as the constructor is
parameterized
so into num1 and
num2 are the parameters
so when will create this object oven and
we'll pass these arguments so it will go
here
and
all right inside this in the definition
of this constructor
we will create a we will declare the
variable res and we will assign
num to n1
will assign
num2 to n2
and let's say we'll do the subtraction
all right
n1 minus n2
all right now we will
display
the result that is res
so
res
and then the variable res
after that we'll use zendell
all right
so
once we are done with this parameterized
constructor then
we will create a operator function
so void is the return type then we will
write
operator keyword
this is the syntax of operator function
then after writing the keyword we'll
write the symbol let's say minus is the
symbol
then the arguments if there are any
arguments then we can put those
then inside the function that is in the
definition
we can perform whatever the
functionality we want to perform
so let's say in this case we'll just
make the numbers negative
so we'll do that
all right
now we'll do the calling part of this
we will simply use the symbol and the
operator
and this is how we'll call the operator
function
this is very simple and after that we
have to display the
digits as well as we have made them
negative in this part
so we'll
create a function display
inside this function we will display
those
digits or numbers
so we will write
n1
all right after this we'll write
we'll do same for n2
so we'll write n2
and 2 then
there is handle in the end
all right so here we are displaying this
so once we are done with this the class
is finished so we can use the semicolon
in the end
and we have to call this void function
as well so
we will write
one dot display
o1 dot
display
all right we are done
let's
see whether it works or not
let's save it
and check it
so as you can see the result is minus 2
that is 6 minus 8 equals minus 2
that is correct and n 1 is minus 6 and n
2 is minus 8 because we have made them
negative inside this operator function
we forgot to add some space in n2 and n1
so that is where it is looking like this
but the answer is correct
and this is how we can do the operator
overloading
in this part we have use the return type
then the operator keyword then the
symbol and if there are any elements
then we can pass those arguments
and if there are not we can put it like
this
so this is our example of operator
overloading let's do another example so
now we'll do an example of function
overriding
so let's name this
poly3.cpp
so in function of writing the function
of base class gets a new definition in
the child class and when we call the
function of the child class using the
object of child class
then the function of base class gets
overridden
so now let's do the example of this
function overriding
i think we have named it wrong
poly3 dot cpp
all right
let's name it four
only four dot cpp all right now let's
save it
now include the header files
using namespace standard
now
we'll start with the class parent
so this is
the base class
and we have named it parent
inside the parent class we will create a
function
for that we will create the public scope
inside
inside the public school we will create
the function print
and
we will display the message
this is the function of parent class or
base class what server
all right
so this is class parent and semicolon in
the end of the class
now we'll clear the child class
child
derived from
parent class
name of the class is parent
similarly we'll do the public scope and
create the function
void print
so it is same function as that of the
above class
and
inside this function we will display
this is
the function of
child class
derived class let's say
all right once we are done with this
semicolon in the end and semicolon in
the end of the class as well
then we can create a main function
and inside the main function
we will create the
object of child class
child obj
so as we have created the object of
child class or derived class so with the
help of this we will override the
function of the base class
so we'll write obj
dot
print
which is the name of the function so as
we have created the object of child
class so it will call the
derived class or child class function
and in the end let's say return 0
now save it
and try to run this
this is the function of derived class
so as we have expected so it is calling
the child class function
so this function of the parent class
gets overwritten as we have used the
object of child class and call this
function print which is of same name
so this function which is in the child
class gets to print
derived class
so this is our output
so now let's do an example of virtual
function in c plus
virtual functions are defined in the
base class to ensure that
the functions gets overwritten
and
when we use the base class pointer to
hold the derived class object or the
child class object the base class
pointer will always call the base
version of the function and not the
derived version
so to solve this problem we use the
virtual keyword in z plus plus so now
let's start with it
first of all we'll write hash include
iostream
now the name space standard
now we will create the base class class
base
and then we'll use the public scope
inside the public scope we will create
the virtual
function
use the
virtual
the return type
then the name of the function that is
print
and we have created this virtual
function inside the base class now we'll
print
this is the function inside the base
class as we have done previously in the
previous question
this function
this is the functional base class here
it could be right
all right once we are done with this
we'll close the class by using semicolon
now we'll create the derived class and
we'll name it derived
from the base class whose name is base
itself
now
here we will use the public scope
and we will create the function
of derived class
print function
and will print
this is the function of derived class
all right
now we'll use the semicolon
to end the class
now inside the int function into main
function
first of all we will create the pointer
of base class
base
d reference operator b
so we have created the pointer of base
class now we will create the object of
derived class
derived d
so now we will store the address of
derived class object to the pointer of
base class
so let's do that
b which is a pointer of base class
address of operator
the object of derived class
so now we will call the print function
using the pointer of base class and it
will print the derived class function
because
the pointer of base class which we are
using to call the functions points to
the derived class object
so now let's do the calling part
all we need to do is
the pointer and the arrow operator
and the name of the function
that is print
after that we can write return 0
now everything is done let's save this
and
run it
as we can see this is the function of
derived class here we can see
so the derived class function is getting
called which we wanted
so this is an example of virtual
function in c plus
we have used this virtual keyword over
here and
using the
base class pointer
we have code this function
and
and these were some examples of
different topics in polymorphism in c
plus plus you can try some more examples
on these topics it will help you in
understanding this topic in a better way
pointers in c plus and in today's
session we will learn about
what is a pointer
reference and d reference operator
then declaration and initialization of a
pointer
then there is pointer arithmetic
and after that we'll go through pointers
and functions pointers and arrays and at
last we have areas of pointers
so hello everyone
this is hajj bhardwaj and welcome to the
video on pointers in c plus plus
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go to our first topic that is
what is a pointer pointer can be defined
as a variable that contains the address
of another variable
it basically stores the memory address
which means
it points to an address of a particular
value
and like a regular variable pointers
have a data type also
now coming to reference and dereference
operators
reference operator or address of
operator is defined as that operator
which is used to get the address of the
variable
it can be easily obtained by preceding
the name of the variable with an
ampersand sign
now dereference operator the reference
operator basically returns the content
stored in the variable pointed by the
specified pointer
for example if we write asterisk a
then it will return the value of
variable pointed by a
now let's see how to declare and
initialize a pointer to declare a
pointer first of all we will write the
data type
after that we will write the name of the
variable with an asterisk sign
for example
int asterisk sign a
float asterisk b
care asterisk c
suppose if we want to store the address
into a pointer
then we will write int that is the data
type
then ptr that is the name of the pointer
with an asterisk sign
equals to a variable a with ampersand
sign
which means
ptr will contain the address of the
variable a
now moving to a pointer arithmetic
c plus plus allows us to perform
addition and subtraction operations on
pointers
a pointer is basically an address that
is it's a numeric value therefore
operations like addition subtraction can
easily be done on pointers
there are four types of arithmetic
operations that can be used in pointers
that is increment operator decrement
operator addition and subtraction
each time a pointer is incremented by 1
it points to the memory location of the
next element
but if the pointer is an integer pointer
its value on ptr plus plus would
increment by 4 bytes because of the size
of in data type
for example assume an integer pointer
with current value of 10.
now after the increment its value would
be 14 instead of 11 because int is of 4
bytes
now let's learn about pointers and
functions
like a normal variable has an address
similarly every function has an address
also and we can easily access the
function using its reference or address
only if we know the address of the
function
function pointers are similar to that of
normal pointers
when pointers are passed to the function
the address of actual arguments in the
calling function is copied into the
formal arguments of the called function
and this is the syntax for a declaration
of function pointer
here ent is the return type and
parenthesis around function pointer
tells the compiler that it is a pointer
to function
and after this
they are argument lists now
let's discuss pointers and arrays
arrays and pointers are very closely
related to each other and both of them
are objects
when an array gets declared the compiler
assigns a continuous block of memory so
that all the elements of an array can be
stored in the memory
and c plus treats the name of the array
as a pointer that contains the address
of first element
which is known as base address
so basically array name is the base
address of the array
and if we have to assign the address or
first element of array in a variable x
then instead of writing x equal to
ampersand array of 0
we can simply write the name of the
array only
now
moving to the last topic that is array
of pointers
like in array we can store similar type
of elements it is same in case of area
of pointers
but the only difference is instead of
storing the elements the address of
similar type of element is stored
in other words it stores the pointers
which point to the similar data type
and this is the syntax first is data
type then name of array with an asterisk
sign
then in the brackets it is the size of
array now
let's do some examples in our code
editor that is vs code if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
here we will do one example of pointer
to understand reference and dereference
operator
we will print the values of variable
and the address of that variable also
and it will give us an idea about
reference and reference operator
let's start first of all we'll make a
new file
and name this file as
pointer1.cpp
so first of all we will import the
header file
cash include iostream
now we will include namespace standard
after that we'll make int
main and now we will declare a variable
val
and assign it a value let's say 105.
now we will declare a pointer variable
ptr
now we will store the address of the
variable val
into the pointer variable
so we will write ptr equals
ampersand well
now
[Music]
we'll display a message
before
printing val variable will display a
message saying
value is
value of
val is
now
let's see what is the value of ptr
for that we will have to print ptr also
and we'll write
value of
ptr
is
now we will print the pointer variable
ptr also
although the value of val and ptr would
be same but in order to check we will
print that also
so we'll write
see out
value of
specific ptr
is
now as we have printed variable val
ptr and asterisk ptr
so now let's check
all these values
let's
write return 0
now let's check all these values
here we can see value of variable val is
105
and the value of ptr is this this is
actually the address
and
the value of pointer variable ptr is
105. as we know that the value of vl and
the pointer variable is same because we
have assigned this value
the address of variable val to ptr
and then the dereference operator
as we know returns the actual content of
the variable so that is why the value of
variable val
gets printed when we print the pointer
variable ptr
and the address over here
is the address of the val variable which
we are assigning to the ptr so that is
why this address is getting printed
now we will do another example
let's name it
pointer two dot cpp
now we'll include the header files
dash include iostream
after that
using namespace standard
so here we have an example of arithmetic
operations in c plus plus
so
first of all we'll write intent
now here we will take four variables and
two pointers
so let's do it
and
num1
command num2
and
sum equals
0
and in
sub
equals 0 will initialize it with 0.
now i will declare the pointers
ptr1
ptr2
so let's take input of the required
variables num1 and num2 and after that
we'll do some mathematic operations on
them
so let's just write
first we'll display a message
enter two numbers
enter
two numbers
now we'll take the input
after this we will store the address of
num1 and num2 into ptr1 and pdr2
respectively let's do it
ptr1 ampersand
num1
ptr2
ampersand num2
now we will increment pointer ptr1 and
ptr2
we'll do in a bracket
and we'll use the reference operator
also
ptr1 plus
the reference operator dtr2
plus plus
here we are using dereference operator
because we want to increment the value
only
and as we can see
we have used increment operator so by
incrementing ptr1 and ptr2
the values of num1 and num2 will
increment and after that we will print
those values so let's do it
before printing we'll just print a
message
after increment
now we will print
ptr1
and line
now ptr2
now we will do the sum of these
incremented values so we will write sum
equals
the reference operator ptr
1
plus
the reference operator ptr2
now we will simply print it
we'll write addition
and we'll print some variable
which we have already initialized as
zero earlier
and we'll write and line
so this will give us the sum of the
incremented values of
num1 and m2
now let's talk about decrementing the
value of pointers using decrement
operator
here by using this operator the value of
the ptr1 and pta2 gets decremented so
let's start
and write
decrement ptr
1
minus minus
that is the decrement operator
now
ptr2
and s minus
now we will write
after decrement
the values of ptr1 and ptr2 so we'll
display a message saying
after decrement
now we will print ptr1 and ptr2
this will display the values of ptr1 and
pdr2 after decrement
and at last we will find the subtraction
of two
so we'll write sub
decrement operator ptr1 minus decrement
operator ptr2
and
c out
will display first subtraction we'll
write subtraction
then we'll write the variable sub
let's see how it
before that i think we forgot to mention
the dereference operator
while printing
we have to mention this because we want
to print the values
the reference operator
and
let's put some space over here
now let's try
enter two numbers so let's say we'll
enter four
and five
as you can see we have entered four and
five after increment it becomes five and
six
and on addition it becomes eleven
after decrement it becomes four and five
again
then
4 minus 5 that is equal to minus 1 so
this is the right answer
and this is how it's done
this was the basic example of arithmetic
operations and pointers
now let's do another example
name this file as pointer 3 dot cpp
now we will include the header files
hash include
iostream
using namespace standard
now we'll write endman
now we will do an example of pointer and
arrays in which all we have to do is to
print an array with the help of pointers
so let's start
first of all we will declare a pointer
now we'll declare an array
named a rrey
and let's add some elements inside it
5
17
[Music]
sorry 20
7
9
4
6.
i think these are seven elements
now we will assign array arr to pointer
ptr so we'll write ptr
equals arr
after that we'll run a loop from i equal
to 0 to i
less than 7 because we won't white rate
our elements
so
let's write for loop
and i equals 0 i less than
7 i plus plus
now we will display
using the reference operator with
pointer
we want to display the values that is
why we have used the reference operator
now we will do
ptr
plus plus
we have used ptr plus plus because we
want the pointer to move to the next
position after each iteration
and ndl will help to print the output in
the next line after each iteration
so after this we'll write
return 0
and let's try to run it
i think there is some error
yeah
namespace
now let's again try to run it
instead of ferry we have used arr
hope it works now
here it is
twenty seven nine four six
five seventeen twenty seven nine four
six
so these are
our array elements which we want to
print
so this is how we can print the array
elements with the help of pointer
so these were some basic examples of
pointers in c plus constructor and
destructor in c plus plus
in this session we will understand
what is a constructor in c plus its
declaration and how a constructor is
different from the function
then we will cover
types of constructors that is default
constructor parameterized constructor
and a copy constructor
and then we will discuss constructor
overloading and destructor in c plus
but before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
so first is what is a constructor in c
plus plus
in c plus constructors are special
functions that are different from normal
functions
they are used to initialize objects of a
class
whenever an object is created the
constructor is invoked or called
automatically even if we do not create a
constructor the compiler automatically
creates a default constructor
now let's move to the declaration of the
constructor
constructors are the member functions of
a class that has the same name as that
of the class and it doesn't have any
return type
a constructor can be defined inside the
class and outside the class as well
using the scope resolution operator
the syntax of a constructor is as
mentioned
inside the class cons we can see there
is a constructor which has the same name
as that of class
that is cons and we can initialize
variables inside it
this constructor will be invoked
automatically when the object is created
now let's understand how the constructor
is different from functions
there are some differences between
constructors and functions
so the first is constructor doesn't have
a return type unlike function which has
a return type
next is the name of the constructor must
be the same as that of the class and it
is not so in case of function
third is whenever an object is created
then a constructor is invoked
and the last one is
function can be a virtual function but
it is not so in case of constructors
so these are some differences between
constructor and a function
now coming to types of constructors
there are actually three types of
constructors in c plus that is default
constructor parameterized constructor
and a copy constructor
so let's start with the default
constructor
a default constructor is a constructor
that doesn't have any arguments inside
it it can either be declared explicitly
or can be generated automatically which
means even if we do not define the
constructor
then also it is generated by the
compiler
for example here
cons is the default constructor
in this case the name of the class would
have been cons that is why the name of
the constructor is cons
now coming to the parameterized
constructor
a parameterized constructor is similar
to that of the default constructor the
only difference is we can pass the
arguments to the parameterized
constructor
the constructor can be overload and also
be used to initialize elements
here is an example of the parameterized
constructor
cons is the name of the constructor and
n1 and 2 are the parameters of the
constructor
now
coming to the copy constructor a copy
constructor is a type of constructor
which initializes an object using
another object of the class
in this constructor properties of one
object is copied to another object
this copy constructor is invoked when an
object is passed as a parameter
if a class has pointers or there is some
dynamic memory allocation then it is
necessary to have a copy constructor
its syntax is as follows
here cons is the name of the constructor
and ampersand obj is the reference of
the object as we have understood all of
these three constructors so let's go
ahead to our next topic that is
constructor overloading
like functions constructor can also be
overloaded
and it is pretty much the same as
function overloading
the constructor must have the same names
and the difference in the number or the
type of arguments will decide
which constructor should be called
here in the example we can see two
constructors with the same names as that
of the class are being overloaded
here the difference in the number of
parameters will determine which
constructor will be called
now coming to the last topic that is
destructors in c plus
just like the constructor the destructor
is also a special function
which deletes or destructs the object as
soon as the object goes out of scope
it basically delocates the memory that
has been assigned to the variables
the name of the destructor is same as
that of the class name with a tilt sign
the destructor doesn't have a return
type and it also doesn't take any
arguments
and here is the syntax of the destructor
so as we have covered the theoretical
aspect of this topic so let's go ahead
to our code editor and cover the
practical examples on this topic as well
so this is visual studio code and here
we will do some examples
of constructors and destructors in c
plus plus so let's start with default
constructor example first of all we'll
create a new file
and we'll name it
cons
one dot cpp
all right so now first of all we'll
write the header files
hash include iostream
now i'll write the using namespace
standard
now we will start with the main function
and inside the main function
we will create an object
so now we will create an object of a
class let's say the name of the class is
book
and object is b
all right
let's write this
now
we have to create the class
so let's create the class
class book which is the name of the
class
and inside the class we'll declare a
variable
which is private
so let's start
pages
is the name of the variable
and
we'll make this variable as private
all right
after this
we'll write the public access specifier
and
now we will create a constructor and
inside the constructor we will
initialize this variable pages
so all right
and make sure to
make the constructor inside the public
access specifier
all right now
we'll assign
let's say 250 to
this variable pages that is the number
of pages is 250 let's say
now
we will display a message
like let's say
the name
of the book
is
the compound effect
it's a famous book
and
after that we'll write endl
for the next line
now again
you will display a message which will
display number of pages so we'll write
number of
pages
and now we will write the variable pages
all right
and after the class we'll put semicolon
and
let's try to understand it again
when we create this object b
this constructor will be called and this
variable that is pages will be
initialized
with the value 250
then this message will be displayed and
then
the value of this variable pages will be
displayed
as we can see we haven't passed any
arguments to this constructor it is a
default constructor
we have created an object of the class
book and
that's how the constructor is
getting called and let's try to run this
hope it works firstly we have to save it
by pressing ctrl and s
now let's try to run it
as you can see the name of the book is
the compound effect
and number of pages is 250 is that we
have initialized it
250
so this is the example of a default
constructor
now let's do another example
now we'll do an example of parameterized
constructor
so let's name this first
cons 2 dot
cpp
all right now
we'll include the header file
hash include iostream
using namespace standard
now
we'll start with the main function so
we'll write int main
and inside the main function
we will create an object of a class
let's say bar
the object of this class would be b
and will pass the arguments let's say
40 and
35
all right
by mistake we have wrote this
all right now after that we'll write
return 0
now let's create this class bar
so we'll write
class
bar
and inside the class we will
here we will declare two variables which
will be private so
let's say
private
and
and the name of the variable is drink
and
another variable would be people
all right
now we have to create the constructor
so we'll write the public access
specifier
and now we'll create the constructor
which is of the same name as that of
class that is bar
and
now
the
parameters would be d
and
b
so we are passing these parameters that
is 40 and 35 to this constructor as this
is a parameterized constructor
so now we will assign
these parameters to the to the private
values
that is drink and people that is the two
variables so we'll write
drink
equal
d
that is we are assigning the value of d
to the variable drink
so and we will do the same for
p variable
we'll sign the value of p to the people
variable
once we are done with this
then we have to compute it or do
something about it so let's say
we have to
multiply it so
it would be
total
cash like the number of drinks into
number of people that how many cash is
collected by selling those drinks so
we'll create this variable
int total cash
this is a function
inside this function
we will multiply the cost of a single
drink with the number of people
so let's say
as the
return type is end so
we have to return
we can't display over here
so
drink
into
people
drink into people
all right
now
semicolon in the end
and
we have to call this function as well
so let's do that
we'll write c out
and
then we will display a message let's say
total cash
collected
then
now we will call this
function
total cash
b dot total cash
b is the object and total cash is the
function
all right
after that we have already mentioned
return zero
so now save it by pressing control and s
and let's try to run this
as you can see total cash collected 1400
and we know 40 into 35
will get 1400 that is the right answer
so as we can see here we have created
this object b and pass these arguments
40 and 35
and this is the parameterized
constructor bar
these values are then assigned to these
variables drink and people
and then we have called this function b
total cash this function over here
and the value
by multiplying drink into people
is 1400 that is 14 to 35 equals to 1400
so this is the example of a
parameterized constructor
now
let's create a new file
and we'll do an example of constructor
overloading
so let's name it
first cons three dot cpp
so here we will do an example of
constructor overloading so first of all
we'll create
we'll write the header files
cash include iostream
then namespace standard
then again we will start with the main
function
and inside the main function we will
write the name of the class let's say
the name of the class would be overload
and
the name of the object is one
so here we will
create a parameterized constructor
so that is why we will send
two arguments let's say 20 and four
and we will create another object
overload
o2
because we want to do constructor
overloading so we have created o2 object
and here we will pass let's say three
arguments
so we'll pass let's say 50
comma 65
comma 30
in the first object
in the first constructor we are passing
two
arguments that is twenty and four in the
second constructor will pass three
arguments fifty sixty five and thirty
all right now let's write return zero
and now we can create the class
let's say
class
overload
now inside this class
first of all we will
create this variable
result res
all right
inside
this after this we will declare
public access specifier and we will
create the constructors
the constructor would be a parameterized
constructor because we are passing the
arguments
so
overload is the name of the constructor
within capital o
and we are passing two arguments in the
first constructor
so
and x comma into y
now in this we will multiply
and we will store it in this
res variable
so x into y
all right after this
the second
constructor and in this constructor we
are passing three arguments
and as you can see the name of both the
constructors are same as that of the
class but the only difference is the
number of arguments
in this constructor we're passing three
arguments
and
now
we will store
the sum of all of these three variables
x plus y
plus
z
once it is done we will put a semicolon
in the end
and now
we have to somehow display the result
so we will create
a function
into the data type
result is the name of the function
and
we will simply
return
the variable res
and now we will
call this function
inside the main class
so before that
we will display a message let's say
result
of
multiplication
is
right one
one dot res
one dot result sorry
because the result is the name of the
function and we are calling the function
after that and line
then we'll write
result
of
addition
is
then we'll write o2
dot
result
and
semicolon
and we have already mentioned return
zero so
let's save it by pressing ctrl s
and
let's try to run this
there is some error
okay this is scope error
we have to include this function inside
this class
so
let's say
now let's try to run this by
after saving this let's
run it
all right
uh by mistake we
write this wrong all right now let's
save it
and now let's try again
here it is result of multiplication is
80 and result of addition is 145
as you can see
and 20 into 4
is 80 and when we add 50 plus 30 80 80
plus
65 would be for 145
so our result is
right and we have successfully compiled
the program and run it
so in this example we have
we are doing the constructor overloading
as we are passing these two
arguments to this constructor with same
name as that of this constructor and we
are passing three arguments to this
constructor
and
we are not actually calling them we are
just creating the object and passing the
arguments
okay now let's do an example in which we
will use destructor as well
so let's create a new file and name this
as
cons4.cpp
all right now let's include the header
files
now name space standard
all right now
we'll write into main
inside int main we will
write the name of the function let's say
the name of the function is formula one
and f is the object
and now we will pass the parameters
let's say 370
and four
here we are passing the speed and the
pickup of a particular car and let's
make it
f instead of d
so f is the object and formula one is
the name of the class
after that for now let's say return 0
and now
we will create a class
class formula
1.
we'll declare
two variables
which are private
int
speed
and end
pickup
now we will create a constructor
which is parameterized before that we
will
use
public access specifier and
now we will create this constructor
formula one
and the parameters are int as comma int
p
now inside it
first of all we will display a message
saying that this is a constructor
all right after that we'll write endl
now we will assign
the parameters to these variables we
will assign the value of s to speed
and the value of p to pick up
all right
after that
we'll
make a function
display
and we can display inside this function
as the data type is void
and so we'll write
speed
is
then we'll
write the speed variable
and end l as well
then you will write
pick up is
pickup variable
then handle
all right
now we can create a destructor
we'll use tilt sign then
formula 1 which is the name of the
constructor
then
here we'll write a message
so that we get to know that we are
inside the
destructor so right
formula one inside it will write this is
a
destructor
and the sign is
here it is
now
write semicolon
after the class and
so first of all as the object is created
the parameterized constructor is called
370 and 4 would be assigned to these
variables speed and pickup
and then
using the function
here we will call this function display
so we'll write f which is the object dot
display
which is the name of the function
and that's it
then once the values are assigned then
these values
will be displayed when this function is
called
using the object f
and then this is a destructor is called
as
the destructor is called in the end of
the function when the scope ends
so when the scope of class object is
ended then this is a destructor is
displayed that is why we have
displayed this message
so
after
saving it
let's try to run this
you can see this is a constructor
first this is getting printed
then speed is 370 speed is 370. pickup
is 4
and this is a destructor as we can see
is getting printed in the last
and if we just
cut it over here and just paint it here
and we can just paste it over here
and
save it and let's try to run this again
this variable by mistake we have
all right now save it and run it again
as you can see this is a constructor
speed is 370 pickup is four
this is a destructor it is again getting
printed in the last
so this shows that the destructor
deletes
the object as soon as the object goes
out of scope
that is in the last
so these were some examples of
constructors and destructors in c plus
plus you can try some more examples on
it it will help you in understanding
this topic in a better way c plus plus
enumeration
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
first is why enumerations are used in c
plus then we'll understand what is
enumeration and its syntax and after
that we will learn how to use enums with
flags
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so first is why enums are used in c plus
enums are short for enumerations
these are basically used when we have
some set of possible values and we have
to select one out of it
for example suppose you are the shop
owner and you have four types of coffee
in your coffee machine
that is cold coffee hot coffee black
coffee and mocha
and you don't want the trouble of
customer putting any other coffee name
in the machine
which is not there
then in situations like these
enumerations are used
because in enumerations we have to
choose from predefined values
and it is also helpful for documentation
and readability purpose
now let's understand what is enumeration
enum or enumeration is a user defined
data type in which a set of values are
specified for the variable and the
variable can take out any value from the
set of values
and it is also a way to use integers to
represent values
we can assign values to enum but if we
do not assign any value
then the compiler assigns value to them
starting from 0.
coming to its syntax
which is enum that is the keyword for
enumerated type then enumerated type
name is written then under brackets
possible values of type enum are written
for example here enumeration name is
player and values are ronaldo
messi neymar which are the names of
players
in this example by default ronald is
zero salah is one messy is two neymar is
three
because we know by default compiler
assigns them value which start from zero
and so on
but we can change these default values
by assigning values to them
like here ronaldo's value is now 4
salaha's value is 2
messi's value is 8 neymar's value is 1.
now let's have a look at an example in
which we will print the default value of
months
so in this example we have enum name as
months and enumerated values as january
february march and so on
and in order to access these values we
have written enumeration name and after
that the variable
as we can see inside main function m is
the variable and its type is months
now here we have assigned the month
march to the variable m
and then we are printing the variable m
plus one
here plus one will print the value next
to the month march that is three and
similarly if we write plus two then it
will print then one next to it that is
four
these values are default integer values
after printing the output value is 3
because we have printed m plus 1 where m
is 2 and plus 1 makes it 3.
now
let's understand how to use enum with
flags
in this example we will choose a mobile
having any of the two features among
three
here the name of enumeration is mobile
and its enumerated values are battery
capacity camera quality large storage
and we have assigned values to them
1 2 and 4 respectively
and because we are doing this example of
enums with flags that is why we are
using integer values of power 2
because it avoids the overlapping
inside the main function we are using
bitwise or operator because we want to
choose the mobile having both camera
quality and large storage capacity and
we know that bitwise operator adds the
binary of two integers
so the value of camera quality is 2 and
value of large storage is 4.
when we use a bitwise or operator in
between these two features so it will
add up their binary giving the decimal
number as 6
so the output 6 is showing both the
camera quality and large storage are
used
now let's do some examples of
enumeration in our code editor that is
vs code
okay now let's make a new file
and name the file as
enum.cpp
in this example the enumeration name
will be captain and the enumerated
values will be the team members out of
which we will select one member as
captain
and with if condition we will verify if
he is the selected captain or not
it will be a basic example so first of
all let's write hash include iostream
now we'll add the namespace standard
okay now we'll write
enumeration enum
captain which is the name of the
enumeration type
and now we will write the enumerated
values
which is
let's say
avi
said
robbie
sammy
and jake
these are the team members
now we'll write int main
now here we will first of all write
captain which is the name of the
numerator type
then we'll make the
variable out of it cap
and let's say avi is the captain so
we'll write a v
now here we will write if condition
will write
if
equal to av
then we'll display
our captain is away and its value is
whatever the value is avi's value here
is zero so we'll display that
so we'll write
our captain
is a v
and its value
is
then we'll write av
as we know that av is at first position
then its value would be default value
would be zero
okay so
here we will write endl
now in else
here if we put said robbie sammy jake as
captain or we if we declare them as
captain then this message would be
declared which will be writing in
else so the message would be
he is not our captain
then over here we will write return 0
ok now let's try to run this
our captain is away and its value is
zero
because here
captain we have declared av so that is
why this is printing if we write
let's say
sammy over here
then it will print the else part
he is not a captain
and if we write jake or said
then also it will print the same
he's not a captain only in case of a v
it will print our captain is away and
its value is
avi's value
so this was the basic example of
enumeration now let's move on to one
another example
now
let's make a new file
and name it as enum2
dot cpp
okay
now we will add the header files hash
include iostream
and using namespace standard
so here we will do an example in which
enumeration name will be supercars and
to the values we will assign some
integers to them
which will be the speed of those cars
and then we will compare them using
comparison operator in terms of speed
so
we will write enum
the name of enumeration that is let's
say supercars
okay
now inside the bracket
we'll write the name of the cars which
are the values
and we will assign
some integers
these integers are actually speed of
these cars
268
then
valkyrie
speed is 240
now
roadster
250
okay now
as you have created the enum now we will
start within main
so we will write the numerator type name
supercars
now the variable speed
one because we want to create two
variables in order to compare them so
first we will create speed one
now again
speed two
now we will assign the two cars that we
want to compare to these variables
so
speed one will be
valkyrie
and speed 2 would be
roadster
okay
now we will write the if condition
and inside the f condition we will
compare the speed of these two cars
so we will write speed 1
if speed 1 is less than
speed 2
okay
then we will print
that it's a win for roadster
because speed 2 is roadster and speed
one is valkyrie so we'll write it's a
win for roadster
with the speed we'll also write the
speed with the speed
of
this speed 2 will display the speed of
roadster that is 250
okay now
else condition
so here we will write
it's a win for
valkyrie
with the speed
of here we will write speed one
okay
now we have to write into main but
before that we will write the bracket
which we forgot to mention
return zero
okay i think it's done
now let's try to run this
here we can see it's a win for roadster
with the speed of 250 as we know that
the speed of roadster here is 250 and
the valkyrie speed is 240
so when we compare it
speed 2 that is roadster wins because
roadster is 250
so this was the second example now let's
do one last example
let's name this
okay
enum3.cpp
we'll write hash include iostream
now name space standard
now in this example we will see how to
use switch statement with the
enumeration okay so
first of all
inside int main
we will write
enum
color is the name of the enumeration
type
then we'll write the values
red
blue
green
and yellow
these are the values
now
here we will use swiss statement
but before doing that we have to assign
one color to a variable
so first of all we have to create that
variable
and in order to create the variable we
will write the numeration type name
color
and then
the variable name select
now we will assign
one color from the above colors
let's say
yellow
now in switch statement we will write
first of all we will write switch
statement
switch
and
we will pass here the variable that is
select
basically we are passing yellow
because yellow is assigned to the
variable select and that is why it is
getting passed
so now
case one that is case
red
first of all we'll write the case red
with a colon in the end
now we will
print that it is red
now we'll write the break statement
break statement basically ends the case
or terminates the case
so after that
the second case that is case blue
colon
now here we will print
it is blue
and similarly
break statement
we will do same for all of these colors
green and yellow also
and switch statement will help us to
find which color is passed and will
display the message of that color
so here we will write
green
it is
green
break statement
now case yellow
now we'll write it is yellow
now he will write break
okay now at last we have to write return
zero
now as we know that we have we have
passed a particular color
to the variable select and select
is the expression and switch statement
will help us
in comparing the variable select value
to the value of different blocks and one
which matches that particular block will
execute
okay now let's try to run this one
here we can see
it is yellow is being printed
which is the right answer because we
have passed the color yellow to the
select
and that is why only the case yellow
output is being printed
so
this is how you can use switch statement
with the enumeration
so these are some basic examples of c
plus plus enumeration you can try some
more examples on it in order to practice
it
so these were some important topics of c
plus programming

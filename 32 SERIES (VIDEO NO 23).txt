hello everyone this is dr. Amiya from
team MDS conquer in this video we are
going to discuss 32 important points
regarding calcification and occlusion
point number one Pulido gingival grew
most commonly seen in maxillary lateral
incisors
point number two molars are called as
cornerstones räikkönen's are called as
corner tip number four cannons are also
known as I picked number five longest
teeth in dental arches cannon number six
means real development and groom is seen
in maxillary first premolars number
seven smallest premolar is mandibular
first premolar number eight Primula with
maximum occlusion modifications is
mandibular second premolar number nine
hard shepherd occlusal surface is seen
in maxillary third molar number ten
enigma of endodontist is mandibular
first premolar because of the
trifurcation sand bifurcations it had
number eleven cusps of caramely is
present in maxillary second primary
molar number twelve fist has been
deciduous mandibular second molar is
buck Calchas number thirteen fifty cusp
in permanent mandibular first molar is
this Delta's number fourteen stepchild
of oral cavity is third molars number
fifteen primary teeth which doesn't
resemble any other teeth in oral cavity
is mandibular first molar member sixteen
shovel-shaped incisors are most commonly
seen in desert individuals
number seventeen chronology of mental
development riven by crone fill and
logan
number eighteen it is modified later by
Skylar and Maslow number nineteen first
tooth to show evidence of calcification
in primary Tati's maxillary and
mandibular central incisors member
twenty
last tooth to show evidence of
calcification in primary Tati's
maxillary second molar number twenty-one
active eruption is
moment of teeth in the direction of
occlusal plane while passive eruption is
pathological process occurs due to
gingival recession number 23 atopic
eruption is due to left one gene number
24 teeth present at the time of birth or
Carla's natal teeth number 25 teeth
erupt within one month of the birth are
called as neonatal tip number 26 most
common natal and neonatal death
our primary mandibular central incisors
number 27 flush terminal plane is the
most common type of occlusion in mixer
dentition number 28 when the teeth are
present in maximum in Turkish patient it
is called centric occlusion number 29
the functional occlusion that is seen in
children with unborn dentition is can I
am guided occlusion number 30 the
binocular chords are structures that
help in guiding these succeed in ears
teeth in the process of eruption number
31 mandibular lingual cusps are called
as guiding cuff sharing cusps and on
supporting cusps number 32 palatal cusp
of maxillary molars are called as stand
cusps supporting us and centric holding
cusps that's it for today's session guys
hope you all devices points well thank
you

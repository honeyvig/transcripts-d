- [Brad] It's lunch time,
and this is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Whenever I can, I try to take advantage
of both of these things and grab lunch
with some of the tech
industry's best and brightest.
This week, I'm meeting up
with one of the planet's
foremost cloud experts, Ben Kepes.
He's also an ultra-marathoner
and part-time firefighter.
- Hey man, so I ordered an Uber Deluxe.
You send me a shuttle?
- You know, this is
like the top of the line
shuttle here at Microsoft.
- So you know I come from New Zealand,
and not only do we get
slow internet speeds,
but we get the dodgy car as well.
- [Brad] In addition to owning your own
industry consulting analyst firm,
you write for Computer World,
you're one of the leading
experts on the cloud,
but you also run ultra-marathons
and you're a volunteer firefighter?
If there's ever a forest
fire a hundred miles away,
you're the man to call.
- You're fun.
I was actually a paramedic,
- Oh, so you dialed it
down a little, you said.
- If we have an accident
while we're driving,
I've got you sorted.
(laughing)
- [Brad] Okay, so when you
consult with businesses
that are in the process of modernizing,
what are the characteristics
of the companies
that really are able to make
that transition successfully?
- Yeah, so like I've already said
it's about culture.
So the culture being adept
probably would change.
- I think so many of us overlook that.
- Yeah, and it's pretty interesting.
I mean, if you look at an organization
I find, 'cause I do a lot of consulting
with these large organizations.
I can walk into an organization
and pretty much I can get
a sense of what it's like.
I look at the torques they use,
I look around, I look at simple things
like what it's like to
get into the building,
what it's like, you know, if they've got
a receptionist there who's kind of about
blocking access to people,
you know, those things.
- That's old school.
- Yeah, it's really those things.
And those things, you
know, people would say
that has nothing to do with
my technology adoption.
- [Brad] Your company
invested in a lot of startups.
Okay, so we're gonna play a game
that I call Startup Game.
Okay, so I'm gonna give you some names
some are real startups and some are fake.
Okay, so the first one is Thundera.
Thunder with an A.
Real
or make believe?
- Fake.
- That is a fake one, you got it right.
Okay, the next one is Foodler.
F-O-O-D-L-E-R.
- Yeah, that's gotta be a Sunken Valley
true company.
- That is a true company.
Okay, the next one, WubbaLubDub.
- See, that's too many letters for a URL,
so that's fake.
(laughing)
- You are a hundred percent right,
and I think your logic is
probably right as well.
Flingr.
- Yeah, now that works, that's true.
- That's a fake one.
But it could've been a legit name, right?
- Yeah.
- BlaBlaCar.
- I'm pretty sure that's
actually a real company.
- That is a real company.
- But it's a bad URL.
- Man, you did, by far, the best
anyone's ever done on that game.
- There you go.
- [Brad] If you were
talking to an organization
that really is kind of
a little bit hesitant
to enter into the cloud,
start using the cloud,
what would be your biggest
piece of advice to them?
- So I think the first piece of advice
is that this is happening.
This change is there, you
don't have any option.
It's kind of this carrot and stick.
So the stick is you have no option,
you have to change.
The carrot is, there's ways that you can
damper with this,
there's ways that you can
do some other little things,
and just showing people what you can do
with things like, you know, Help EI,
when it's in the cloud, for example.
Just showing people the
value that that unlocks.
In a small way, in a discreet
part of their business,
we'll get them to kind of
develop the muscle memory,
like it's getting to feel a
little bit more comfortable,
until they can start moving
more or mass into the cloud.
- [Brad] You know, one interesting thing
I was thinking about as you were talking,
you know, we made the decision
as we were building what I oversee
in Enterprise Mobility and Security,
back in 2012 they were going to do it
entirely from the cloud.
And I remember in 2014, you know,
about one out of two
customers would tell us,
"Hey, I'm not comfortable
doing this from the cloud."
2015 it was maybe 20 percent.
Now, it's rare that I ever hear
an organization say, "Hey,
I'm not totally comfortable
with my management security
coming from the cloud."
- You know, it's totally funny.
I mean, just the awareness.
I've been doing this
for, I guess, ten years
since the cloud's been around.
And four or five years
ago, I was at a function,
I was introduced to an elected
member of parliament in New Zealand,
and someone introduced me
as this global cloud expert,
and this dude said,
without a word of light,
"You study the weather, do you?"
Fast forward to today,
only a few years later,
and there's no one that doesn't have
at least a vague notion
about what the cloud is.
And it translates into organizations
who understand it, are starting to use it,
to some extent.
And it's the ridge, right?
We're kind of midway up
the angle of the ridge,
and it's only getting lighter.
It's the reality.
- And there's literally no limit
on where this can go.
- And it's cool for those of us
who have been kind of, you know,
saying, "this is the
future," for ten years.
It's so cool to kind of be vindicated.
- [Brad] Next time, on Brad
Anderson's Lunch Break:
- I think it's really disrespectful
for the pandets who say,
"Public cloud is the only way
and private cloud isn't real."
Because at the end of the day,
that doesn't respect the reality
for a number of organizations.

hello everyone today we are here to
discuss a project on
python and how python can be used to
invoke
and send messages
in
whatsapp
so what we're gonna today do is we're
gonna demonstrate you
how to use pi what kit it's a python
utility which is available
in order for you to interact directly
with the
python and whatsapp
so we will show you certain examples
using which you can directly interface
with your whatsapp now in order to
perform this activity
first you need to go to your python
installation folder
now in my case i have my python
installed in my app data local programs
python python 310
so your first task is to go and open a
command prompt from this folder
and then
you need to install
pip install pi what kit
so under python 310 there is a folder
script
and you paste this command
and you should get
this particular message if you have
already installed pi what kit if not
then python will install the relevant
library in your computer
after you have done this then
go back
to your python root folder
go to the python terminal
and then run the command import
pi what kit
okay so after you have installed the pi
vodkit library then you need to import
the pi what kit and this message should
be successfully imported
now
i want to send a whatsapp message
to
a phone number
and i want to send it at a particular
time so right now i'll just set the time
as
20 38
and please make sure that you are
already logged in to your
web.whatsapp.com
and so that
you know uh the when python tries to
send a message you are already
pre-logged in okay
okay so now if you see with this message
with this api i'm going to send the
message at 8 39 so this will go and open
the whatsapp window in next 46 seconds
and after 20 seconds the message will be
delivered so 8 39 so when the timer in
my system clock will reach to this
particular time
python will open a whatsapp window
log into that
reach to this phone number which is
there in my whatsapp contacts and then
after 20 seconds this message will be
delivered
so let's just wait for a few seconds and
wait for python to perform that activity
yes now
python has opened the web.whatsapp.com
in which i'm already logged in it has
reached out to that number
and typed the message welcome to simply
learn world
and i can send this message
now
let's move on to the another example
if i want to send a message to a
whatsapp group
then you need a whatsapp group chat id
and the message you want to send so now
in order to send a message to the
whatsapp group
you can pick any
whatsapp group in which you are
administrator
go to the
group info
and
click invite to group via a link
and in this link
copy
copy this part
copy link
go to notepad
just copy this part this is the group id
okay and paste it over here
okay
so now
you can
send message to a group
copy paste this
in your command prompt
set the timing
in 16 seconds whatsapp will open a
window and after 30 seconds the message
will be delivered
okay so whatsapp window is open
it will reach out to that particular
group
it will type the message
and submit it
and even it will close the window
automatically now okay
so this particular
command has typed the message submitted
it and closed the window
now if you want to send the whatsapp
message instantly
you just
use the api send what's message
instantly
and it will send it instantly to the
user
now another utility is that if you want
to
find a keyword
on youtube
so we'll just play
on youtube simply learn on youtube
so
it will automatically play the youtube
channel which you have put in that
particular keyword
on the youtube so
python can also directly open a youtube
url
or if you want to do a google search
here we go so as soon as you put that
command on the python
console it will open google.com and
search it
so with these utilities you can
directly interact
create your program to interface
python with whatsapp
i hope you had a great learning session
and i look forward to connecting with
you in my next session thank you

[Music]
hello everybody and uh welcome to this
last session of the day the last session
before the big celebration is happening
somewhere
behind us here
in a big room and
um I'm very very happy that you have
chosen to share this time here with us
today
because we're going to talk about some
cool tips and tricks for visual studio
right productive developers are happy
developers and this is very important
stuff so we want to make sure you have a
good time
I know you kind of want to get to that
celebration get some food get a drink
maybe
so let's have a good time let's have
some fun
and if you have any questions
please post them to the usual place
online
we got the Jim and Vera sitting over
here and Matt and Andy sitting remotely
helping to answer the questions as we go
along and if we have time at the end we
can take some of the uh the bigger
questions at the end of the session here
so
um
let's just get to it
all right so
here I have a project oh
look at this
hang on oh you know what it is look at
all my tool Windows it all looks like a
mess here what happened was that before
I plugged in up here I had my laptop
plugged into like a large monitor
that's really wide so I had all this
room for Tool windows but now it looks
kind of
all crammed in so let me just uh fix
that real quick
there we go
or
as I like this here fresh car smell this
is my favorite uh way to start Visual
Studio in the day
Windows minimized oh very very nice and
I can just go between all these layouts
here
all right here's my wider screen layout
here's my web layout
and here's my fresh car smell
so
this is not a new feature I'm showing
you here I'm doing this with a single
keyboard shortcut to move between all
these it's called saved Windows layouts
the reason I want to show you this is
because I know we got data on this that
you don't use it
so
what you do is that you create all your
tool Windows you drag them around you
put them in the location you want maybe
multiple monitors you have solution
Explorer on one side and test Explorer
on the other whatever it might be
and then
you go to window
and just hit save window layout
when you do that that gives you a bunch
of all your saved layouts you can give
them any name you want and very easily
you can change between them so that's
what I did with all the keyboard
shortcuts here Ctrl alt and then you
know one two three four five however
many you've got
so a little tip to get started
all right so
this project I Got Loaded here
it's a web API project asp.net
and it has swagger so it renders this UI
when I run it in the browser that's what
it looks like
so I can see all my endpoints
but Visual Studio has never really had
that ability for me to really quickly
get a glance of what are the different
endpoints that I have in my app
so if I do my saved window layout for my
web workload see I don't just have a
window layout for each monitor
configuration I have one for the
different types of apps I'm building
so when I'm in web mode here
I want to show the new
um
endpoint
explore
shows up here so this looks pretty much
what we saw on the Swagger UI I get to
see all my endpoints here
can take this let me just drag it up
here
there we go
so that's kind of nice and I can even
open all these different
um
these are basically routes right my
endpoints I can see what file they
belong to the methods I can navigate
through them by clicking on them and so
on
but what if I want to make an HTTP
request to any of these
so let's go down
and look at
the contact endpoint here I'm going to
right click
and I can also generate requests
click that and it's going to create
an HTTP file dot http
This Is A New Concept in Visual Studio
it's not the new a new concepts of the
world an extension for vs code and a few
other
editors support this format
but what it does it allows me in plain
text
to send requests
let me just zoom in here a little bit
so check this out
it creates a variable at the top
to point to my local host
and I can just hit the play button
and it will now send an HTTP request and
return it right here
so
because this is an HTTP file it's just a
text file on disk I can check this into
my source control
so my team members can see how to use my
API or our API
but also I can use it as documentation
let's say I have an open source project
or something like that this file can now
act as documentation on how to use the
API
and um
oh
let me get my
explore I think back here let's do
another get request here I'll just right
click another one of the end points here
this is one that returns for certain ID
let's do ID number two
and hit the
execute here and now we can see we get
just that one request or sorry that one
record back
um but I can also make a post I can make
anything here and you see these green
pound signs or hashes
those are the delimiters between the
different requests I'm sending
but I can go in here and see now I want
to do a post request
so I'm going to say well oh
content type
application
Json all right
and then I just need to give it some
Jason I got something right here
copy that in
oh I just want to make sure you can see
it here we go so I'm going to make a
post request to this particular endpoint
and I'm going to pass it in a HTTP
header and a request body
and executing that super simply gives me
this just a confirmation pack and if I
now get all my records again
we can see that I now have oh did I not
send it correctly maybe not
ah
is that right
all right it's here
there we go thank you everybody
so now as I'm building up my HTTP file
here I'm documenting my API and I'm
making something that
my whole team can use to test new things
you know to test the API that we're
building
so really really handy and what's really
cool is if some of you are using vs code
some of you are using visual studio and
whatnot this file works on all the
different editors
they all understand this format
all right but
speaking of testing
what if I want to test something that or
I have a mobile app talking to my API
and it might be a colleague of mine that
builds that mobile app and that
colleague wants to test something that
I'm doing on my laptop here on the API
how do we take a mobile app from one
person's
desktop and connect it over to my API on
my localhost
well typically that's not really been
that easy there are some products out
there that can help with that
you have to pay for them
but now you probably have heard this we
have Dev tunnels
and so
I can go up here on my play button and
go to Dev tunnels
and I can create a new tunnel
let's give it a name how about build
we can then say should this be temporary
or persistent like how long should we
keep this Dev tunnel alive let's just do
a temporary
and what about the security of this
should be
just private organizational or public
let's do public
so now I've created a tunnel and I'm
gonna here's a confirmation you've
created a tunnel yes thank you
so now if I run the app again Ctrl F5
it's going to spin up that same
swaggering as before
but this time
it's going to show me a confirmation you
are about to connect to a developer
tunnel and then some sort of URL
and we can see I get the exact same
UI here but
it's no longer a local host
it's this other thing
and just to prove that I'm not cheating
here
if you want to
you can point your camera that you're at
that QR code right there and see if you
can hit this because remember we did a
public endpoint
uh
so you should see the exact same thing
on your mobile device okay
I'm gonna just grab this
URL
and I can go back to my HTTP file
and
paste it in right here
okay so now I changed my URL
and if I hit the button here
I'm now creating a request toward the
public
API and it works just fine right because
I have a death tunnel that basically
connects the public internet with my
Local Host right here so if I build web
hooks or viable apis for mobile apps
or if I have any other scenario where I
need someone else or some other system
to connect to my machine
do I want to test maybe I want to test
whatever website I'm working on on my
phone to see if it renders correctly on
a mobile device
I can now do that super easily
and not only is it easy
it's free
so that's very very nice
[Applause]
all right
so
so that was the
endpoints the the web server endpoints
but what about the code that generated
them
so here they are this is what it looks
like
um
web API this is what web API looks like
nowadays and you know I don't
necessarily know how this works I
remember back in you know.net framework
with MVC
and so this looks a little bit different
to me than I'm used to
and you probably know this when you're
working with apis that you're not you
don't know if you're using a new nougat
package
that you haven't used before you don't
know how to use that API that it
provides or if you're new to a team you
don't know how that team writes their
code right
so if we look at this code here there's
something called group dot map post
right here I don't
I'm not sure what that means
so check this out
if I just hover over
this API
okay I got to be faster look at the
bottom I'm sorry I can't scroll this but
at the bottom it says GitHub examples
and documentation I'm holding the mouse
over
the method called map post okay this is
an API method
so I'm not going to click this and it
opens up
a new window right here
assuming just check the scroll bar this
is a long list
of examples of other apps using this API
in all sorts of different kinds of ways
there's really a lot here I can learn a
lot by doing this
like what did I have to do before I had
to go read documentation right well if
there was documentation
but now I get to see how people are
actually using it right here and it's so
clever
that it even knows about the different
overloads for this particular
method and it can give me all these
examples
what's really helpful to me here what I
really think is really cool about this
direction is first of all in order to
provide relevant
examples
the AI engine in Visual Studio
understands the context that my code is
in so when I hover over something it
understands
what that code is there for and can
therefore give me relevant
examples
but last year a survey came out I think
this is even more interesting a survey
came out that found that the average
developer
codes
for 52 minutes per day
the rest of the time goes with
reading code
reading documentation
code reviews
you know email meetings and so on
so all the time we spent reading
documentation wouldn't that be nice if
we can kind of get that back
and we can code some more so instead of
52 minutes we can get 50.
eight or even more
and that's what this helps me with this
has saved me several times already I've
used this for a couple of months now in
our internal bills and it's now all
available here
to everybody so
I'm very excited for that one
all right let's um
let's add a new folder to this project
so you know how you add a folder you
right click oh
go down to add new folder right that's
how we do it
so recently we added a new thing that
instead of doing that I can do add new
item
but you know add new item let's do the
keyboard shortcut what's the shortcut
for add new item
shift F2 okay there's someone here that
knows what I'm about to show it's Ctrl
shift a add new item
and we get this little thing up now
this doesn't look like that add new item
thing
the add new item thing looks like this
that's what I'm looking for normally
right
but it now has this compact View
and so if I want to do a folder
let's call it folder I'm just going to
end it with a slash
and hit enter and immediately that was
created there
okay
so some oh all right I'll take it thank
you
so
what's this Ctrl shift a does it always
gets you back to the view used before
did you use the compact view or the full
View
but if you're like me I always want the
compact view first regardless of whether
or not I use the full view earlier and
so what someone was saying shift F2
always gets you to the compact view
regardless
and from here
oh I can
do some other cool things
I can create a
what if I create two files foo.cs
followed by I bar.cs
now
I got two phones
super easy
well what if I want to create a
subfolder or a file inside a subfolder
that doesn't exist I can do SUB folder
slash
.cs
and now I have that file
so I can comma separate I can create
subfolders I can create folders
super easily here
I'm very excited for this feature
um
this was one of the highest voted for
extensions that existed that you voted
for us to put in the box
so it's finally here and um
I love it
but
how smart is this thing
so this was the bass class here's the
foo class it's a class how does it know
it's a class I just gave it a file name
well because it maps to the templates
that was in that big view the old add
new item dialogue you know we have all
those templates it is clever enough
to map file extensions to what is
probably the most likely template that
you want in this case a class
but what about that I bar file that we
did
it's an interface
yes exactly
because naming convention right all
right bar makes sense
so this thing is pretty clever and um
and that's cool
I want to show you something else that's
really clever this is another thing that
um
I think it was until we added this no
more than I think two weeks ago
the second highest voted feature
that we add and it goes like this
what is the difference between
enthusiasts and I bars yes
or in another way how do I find out what
the difference is
well now I can right click one
and I can compare with any file on disk
or I can select this for compare
so now I take I bar right click that and
can say compare with food.cs because
that was the one I just selected
and doing that gives me the diff View
[Applause]
yeah finally
sorry for the wait it's now here and
this is just the first
um the first feature we have of this uh
we're going to look at much more
comparison between files and clipboards
and all sorts of things that have to do
with file comparison and different going
forward this is the first one that
landed uh and it's in the the latest
preview release
all right
I'm going to shift over here to a
different
project different instance of Visual
Studio
here I have
a bigger project loader I think it's two
projects actually in this solution
and I got a bunch of stuff open here you
know I'm gonna
I don't even know how many files I got
open so I'm just going to start by
clicking up here
next to the tabs and say show tabs in
multiple rows
oh yeah thank you so now I can actually
see all the tabs that are open
[Applause]
um but I just opened this project or
this solution rather
and
you know if I'm working on something if
I'm working on a solution I'm working on
a task
and I'm not finished with the task but I
have to go home
you know in the afternoon
I'm not closing Visual Studio I'm going
to I leave it in the
that stated it's in so that when I come
in the next morning I can continue where
I left off
but for all the times when I don't need
to continue where I left off let's say
I'm done with the task of the day I
probably closed Visual Studio
and then when I start Visual Studio
again in the morning and I open my
solution
I don't want this I don't want it to
open to the state I was in yesterday
so this might not be true for you this
is me okay
I don't want this because
I want the fresh car smell
this is not fresh car smell it has
everything open and
notice solution Explorer everything is
expanded okay
so what happens is when I open this
solution in Visual Studio then says oh
let me hydrate the state
that this solution was in the last time
it was worked on from disk
into memory
and then on the UI thread expand all the
notes in solution explorer that means
nothing else can happen we can't paint
anything else on the screen at that
point while that runs
and then we're going to open some C
sharp files which means we have to load
all of Roslyn we have to load the
language Services the colorizers all
those things
who says I'm even going to open a C
sharp file
that might not be what I'm going to do
right now
so
I'm going to go to tools options
and under project and solutions there
are two check boxes that are there
unless we remove them
one of them is called reopened documents
on solution load and the next one is
restore solution Explorer project
hierarchy State on solution load that's
a mouthful
going to remove that too
and click ok
so let me close the solution
and I'm going to open it again
okay one two three click
and there it is
so
very very fast solution load here
because no state was hydrated by reading
a file on disk into memory onto the UI
thread okay and
fresh car
this is wonderful
foreign
I got two quick ones to go notice
the top it has like this orange Banner
if I go back to the other solution it
had a green Banner what's this about
well
I'm using an extension here and I want
to mention this not because this
extension is particularly awesome which
it happens to be particularly awesome
but
because
there's so many cool extensions out
there and I want to make sure that you
know about that we have extensions I
think you needed to be reminded
sometimes
that there's thousands literally
thousands of extensions that can help us
be more productive and this one is
called solution colors and it allows me
to give any color
to any solution
including if I'm working on the same
solution in two different instances of
Visual Studio but different branches
they can have different colors because I
can sometimes have a hard time
differentiating between the different
open instances of Visual Studio again
and check this out
it even puts that color down here in the
windows
jump list or taskbar
so I can very easily navigate between
the two
all right so the last thing I want to
show you
I gotta have to be fast here is
um code cleanup
and code cleanup profiles so
again
it is not the newest of features but I
know that you're not using it okay so I
want to draw your attention to this this
is cool
this little thing down here that looks
like a Duster or broom or something
it's called code cleanup and I can
configure code cleanup into two profiles
by default it just has a few fixes
included
but I can take all the available ones
and we got a lot now I'm going to hold
down shift so that I can select multiple
here
move that up click ok
so now what I'm doing is that I'm
applying all my coding standards that I
have configured either in my settings
under Tools options or if I'm a team I
probably have an editor config file
so whatever wherever I get my coding
standards and Coach styles from
I can have Visual Studio apply this
super easily so let's take this file as
an example
I can now hit Ctrl ke
and
my entire team's coding standards are
now applied
really really quickly
so about 20 of code reviews go to
talking about code standards and coding
Styles and so now we can get that time
back because I can do that very easily
here I can even set it up so it happens
automatically on Save okay I don't even
have to invoke this manually
and speaking of of getting ready for
code review
we have some brand new features in
Visual Studio 2022 for working with
git and to demo some of that I want to
invite my friend Jesse on stage to show
some of the really really cool and new
things that we have available Jesse
all right
awesome hi everyone my name is Jesse and
I'm the product manager for the Version
Control team in Visual Studio
we know that you care a lot about
productivity and we want to boost that
productivity while you're using git so
my goal is to show you how we've made
Version Control easy and efficient by
allowing you to do more in the IDE and
minimize distractions that take you out
so to set the stage for the demo
we've made some changes and I've already
opened the get changes window here
so let me make that a little bit bigger
I've got some changes in my resize file
and my enumclass
and I'm going to start preparing my
commit
so there are two GitHub issues that I
care about in this scenario
the first one is actually tracking the
work that I'm doing on this project and
the second one I was tagged in by a
colleague because they thought it was
relevant to my work
so as I start typing my commit I'm going
to use the closest keyword
when I complete this pull request it's
going to go ahead and close that issue
for me so I don't have to worry about it
that's nothing new
but then I want to reference my GitHub
issue
and what you would need to do is go out
into the browser copy paste that issue
ID or look up and find exactly what
you're looking for but if you had a good
idea
of the title or the name of that one you
can use our issue search so if I type
the hash button I get that list of all
of my recent issues that I've been
tagged on I can use keyword search to
narrow down my results and I can find
exactly what I'm looking for without
leaving Visual Studio
yeah it's pretty awesome
the other issue that I wanted to
reference
let me do that quickly and I'll use the
button here which does the same exact
thing let me narrow that down grab that
and you can see that both of these items
were added to my related item section
and if I wanted more context I can right
click and open these directly in the
browser
so
I'm realizing this is my last commit
that I want to make before completing my
pull request so just to avoid any
surprises happening in the pipeline I'm
going I'm going to go ahead and rebuild
my solution
now we've all been there where a build
starts and it might take a while to run
we might be tempted to leave Visual
Studio go check teams or catch up on
email
and we heard that it's a blocker to not
be able to do your git operations
so we've enabled staging
and then committing all while the build
is running so I can continue doing my
git flow while the build is still going
on and you can see that happening below
all right
let's look at my git repository window
I've got some updates in there that I
want to share
so I've clicked on the view all commits
button that's my preferred way easiest
way to get there
and I want to draw your attention the
graph here is nothing new but we did add
some UI enhancements to Aid and
readability
and what I want to show is the
multi-branch graph that we've created
so I mentioned that I'm creating a pull
request and I'm going to do that against
the develop branch
so let me just click on this eye icon
and visualize that and now I can see
exactly how my commits stack up between
my branches whereas before I'd have to
wait till I made my pull request and get
that view in the web so now I'm all
prepared to create my PR right away
awesome another great thing about the
multi-branch graph is that it makes me
really confident when I'm performing
complex git operations
now if I was asked to cherry pick a bug
fix for a branch that I worked on a
while ago I'd be fumbling between stack
Overflow trying to find the right
command and then the right commit ID so
that I didn't make a mistake and mess up
my reap up
so with the multi-branch graph I can
just visualize that bug fix Branch let
me scroll to it really quick
and then I can right click here
and then if I want to make doubly sure
that this is the right change I can
double check that in my commit details
and now that I'm confident I'll go ahead
and just click cherry pick
I've got the banner to let me know that
was successful then I can scroll back to
the top of my feature branch and just
ensure that that's exactly the right bug
fix I wanted to apply
that was so much easier than having to
go track down the right command to do
that
cool so you
figured out all of the commits that you
wanted to add to this PR the build ran
successfully and now you're ready for
that last step which is creating your
pull request
so I'm pushing my changes
and I'm greeted with that Banner that
lets me know that it was successful
and then you might be familiar with this
link
today if you tried it out and clicked on
that link it would take you out into
github.com or Azure devops or wherever
you were creating that floor quest in
the web
but we heard from you all that it's
pretty silly to be able to complete 90
of your workflow in visual studio and
then have to leave to do the last 10
percent
so I'm excited to share the new pull
request view in Visual Studio which
allows me to finish creating that right
in the IDE
so it's got everything that you might
want I'll go ahead and quickly create
my pull request it's not going to be
terribly descriptive or interesting but
you guys are going to do much better
than I am
and then
I've got that same issue search
available here
and I can go ahead and create that pull
request
and see it
by refresh available on GitHub right
there
so these are all the features that I
wanted to share in the time I had today
but they're only a fraction of the
updates that we've made make sure that
you're downloading the latest preview of
visual studio and engage with us on
developer Community these were all
different requests that came from you
all and it's what allows us to make such
awesome features so I'll give it back to
meds but enjoy the rest of your build
thanks
yeah that's some good stuff
um
and uh everything you saw here so far
has is currently available except for
the last PR the pull request thing it's
coming very soon so during the summer
here or winter if you're on the southern
hemisphere I guess but soon let's say
um other things we talked so we talked a
lot about like things that you're
requesting us to put into Visual Studio
new features all this stuff and the
thing that comes up all you know all the
time of course is performance
and um it's hard to demonstrate
performance in a setting like this so I
just want to make sure I had a slide to
let you know that it's something we
actively work on we have a lot of
Engineers that work on this it's their
full-time job and we have made some
great strides 17.5 came in um it's the
version of Visual Studio 2022 that we
shipped in February it had a bunch of
improvements if your.net developer
um check out the new build acceleration
if you haven't already you're going to
cut your build times uh by 80 it's like
a huge win
there's a whole lot of other things
solution load is eight times faster if
you have those some of those big
solutions that really need that extra
boost
um solution closed which is
interestingly enough is actually a thing
who thought that that would matter but
it does and it's now faster and so is
the profiler I want to I want to call
out the profiler uh for two reasons one
is
you're not using it
and it's fantastic
it lets you
find performance
issues hot paths reliability issues very
very easily in directly in Visual Studio
it instruments your running app and it
can give you all those answers and we've
been making so many updates to it that
it's better than ever and it's really
can answer those hard questions about
performance and reliability and
it now generates the results three and a
half times faster for me that has
actually meant I can make it part of my
inner loop so when I write Visual Studio
extensions for instance
I can run the profiler just that I would
like run my debugger because it's now so
fast it's not something I have to think
of doing later on it's just something
that's part of my inner loop and it
makes my code stronger
um
all right so
all this stuff is um of course we
continue work on performance so uh 17 6
we've released a week ago 17 7 preview
one has even more stuff
um so go check out the latest and
greatest uh 17.6 if you're on the
release Channel if you're on the preview
Channel
get 17.7
and the extension I showed you was
called solution colors if that has any
interest
all right
so
three weeks ago I think Dante something
like that we had a blog post coming out
about a topic that turned out to be
really interesting to all of you
and so we thought we can't do build
without
showing you and talking about this
particular subject and
for that I want to invite my friend
Dante on stage
to do exactly that Dante
thanks France so my name is Dante gagne
I'm one of the product managers of
visual studio and I'm in charge of the
UI refresh so as mads mentioned we
published a blog post about the UI
refresh that we've been working on and
yeah I want to come up here and show a
little bit about what we're doing so
I'll go ahead and show you what we're
looking at and basically if you've been
looking at visual studio and saying to
yourself you know this looks like a UI
that was designed uh like a decade ago
and the reason is is because for the
most part it has been it's been a while
since we've had a new refresh and we
decided it's time to do a new one and
this isn't something that we take on
light light mostly because the UI in
Visual Studio this is something that
affects every single one of us it's
something that we're going to be looking
at every second of every hour that we
work on visual studio and that's more
than the 52 minutes we spend coding it's
really all your time is going to be
spent time so we want to make sure we
get it right we want to spend the time
and make sure it's going to be the UI
that it's going to be more comfortable
and it's going to be something that
we're going to enjoy working in and our
guidance is we want to make it the most
accessible and approachable UI that
we've ever had now I'm not gonna go
through all the design principles I'm
going to encourage you go up to AKA dot
Ms slash vs fluent that's the blog post
that we put up there and it's got all of
the principles and everything
but what we're doing this time we really
want to work with our community we want
to work with you to make sure that this
is the UI that we're ready to work with
some folks who have been working with
visual studio for a while might remember
some of the UI that
wasn't necessarily accepted quite so
well and we want to make sure that this
time it is what we want and let me show
you what I'm talking about here
what I'm showing on the screen now the
top toolbar is the toolbar that you've
got right now in visual studio if you've
got 17 6 or any of the more recent ones
that's what you've gotten below that is
one of the toolbars that we showed in
that blog post this conforms with some
of the web content accessibility
guidelines of larger controls that make
it easier say for people with a motor
disability to be able to click on those
controls and make sure that they're not
misclicking larger controls reduce
cognitive load make it a little bit
easier for people to use it a lot of
things like that that adhere to the
fluent UI design guidelines a whole
bunch of other things like that
but the feedback we immediately got from
our developer Community is
it's a little bit too big
so we went back and said you know based
on the guidelines that we're working
with and based on the community
guidelines or the community feedback
that we're getting can we take all of
that into account and below that I'm
showing the next Generation mock-ups
that we're working with so we're
iterating on that feedback and we're
iterating on our design principles and
we're moving towards a UI design that we
feel is going to be more in line with
what we're trying to reach that
accessible and approachability and at
the same time taking into account what
our our community what our developers
folks like yourself what's more
important to you and that's how we're
approaching this UI refresh we want to
make something that is going to be what
we are going to be spending a lot of our
time doing in the days and years to come
here's another example the document tabs
these ones again the top one is the
document tabs that you're used to and
the one below that is the one that we
showed in the blog post and immediately
we heard people say don't take any room
from the coding window please don't take
any room from the coding window okay how
what can we do with that one how can we
change the things and the bottom one was
showing one that took quite a bit less
room from the coding window and in fact
one of my designers is showing me a new
mock-up that she was just working on
that actually gave one or two more
pixels to the coding window but still
adhere to those design principles that
we're working with and all of these
things that we're doing are coming from
feedback from the community
now I've already had a couple people
asking me when are we going to get a
chance to look at this and the answer is
I don't know right now because we don't
we're not ready to make this available
in the previews until we're making sure
that we're listening to the feedback
from the community and we're taking that
all into account we've got time we're
not in a rush to put this out because we
want to be very deliberate for this
refresh before we're rolling it out so
we don't have a timeline on it we want
to take our time and we want to get this
right and the way we get that right is
with engagement with y'all and getting
you all into the conversation so I do
want to encourage folks once again AKA
dot Ms slash vsfluent that's the blog
post and we're going to continue to
engage at vs fluent we're going to
continue to be working with developer
Community I know mads and uh Jesse both
mentioned that as well that we're
working with the community and we're
really serious about that with UI
refresh here please join in the
conversation and we're going to continue
to iterate on that with everybody there
so
um
with that I look forward to talking with
folks more about it and I'll hand it
back to men's
thank you thanks Dante
all right so we are at the end of uh
this session and I want to just take a
moment and say thank you so much
for coming here I know it's just before
the celebration and you're probably
thinking when does he shut up so I can
go stand in line
I understand but before I let you go uh
I just want to say
it's been a privilege to be here on
stage
with these two fine people representing
the visual studio team and show you
some.net things some some Visual Studio
things and as you know there's a bunch
of different sessions here at build
about Azure and all sorts of different
uh topics and if you want more visual
studio and net it is super important
that you tell us and the way you tell us
is to fill in one of these session
surveys like give us a good rating here
in the comments let us know you want
more visual studio and Dot net for
future conferences whether it's build
ignite or whatever it might be the
powers that be listen to that stuff so
please help us out and uh cast your vote
so to say
thank you so much and see you in
Celebration

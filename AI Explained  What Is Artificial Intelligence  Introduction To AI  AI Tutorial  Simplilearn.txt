in this era technology has become an
integral part of our daily lives from
the moment we wake up to the time we go
to bed we interact with AI in ways we
might not even realize many of us are
familiar with how artificial
intelligence seamlessly integrates into
our routines enhancing our experience
and making our lives easier in countless
ways think about it when you open
Spotify to listen to music the
personalized recommendation you receiv
are powered by AI algorithms analyzing
your listening habits and preferences
Google Maps to utilize AI to provide
realtime traffic updates and suggest
faster route for your morning commute
helping you navigate through the hustle
and the bustle of the city life with
these even your smart assistant like
Alexa plays a crucial role in your daily
routine reminding you of important
appointments and keep keeping you
organized throughout the day these
example are just tip of the iceberg when
it comes to an AI inaction but behind
the scenes AI is constantly at work
processing vast amount of data and
learning from our interaction to provide
us with past experience and solution
it's like having a helpful Friend by our
side anticipating our needs and guiding
us through the complexities of modern
life so join us as we Deep dive on the
journey to explore the world of AR
arcial intelligence we will dive into
the ways AI impact Our Lives uncover the
history of AI and perhaps even glimpse
into the future of technology but before

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your back
if you want to switch careers with AI
and ml then try giving simply runs
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning from P University in
collaboration with IBM this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP computer
vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat GPT and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box
below and the pin comments so now the
question arises why the current hype is
in the world around AI what's the
different now so let's get started why
AI matters AI processes the capability
to revolutionize various sector spanning
Finance education transportation and
healthare by automating repetive task
refining decision making process and
accelerating data analysis AI holds
immense potential for transformative
impact presently the creation of large
scale generative AI model remains within
the realm of select few technology
Giants the system demands substantial
computing power and data resources
consequently a handful individuals
leading these organization wield
considerable influence over the
direction of AI application with far
reaching implications for Society at
large so after learning why AI matter
let's see some history of AI and where
it comes from history of AI artificial
intelligence is not a re term or
technology for researcher it's actually
much older than you might think there
are even stories of mechanical begins in
ancient Greek and Egyptian myth alen
Turing a pioneer of AI proposed in 1950
that if a machine can engage in
conversation with human and the human
can't tell whether they are talking to
another human or machine then the
machine has shown humanik intelligence
the concept of machine learning became
widely known in the 1950s after view
were witness a demonstration of Arthur
Samuel's Checkers program defeating its
human opponent Robert nearly on
television however for many years AI was
mostly associated with expert in
technology and fans of science fness so
let's move forward and see what is AI
artificial intelligence so artificial
intelligence EI is the simulation of
human intelligence in machine that are
programmed to think and act like humans
learning reasoning problem solving
perception and language comprehension
are all examples of cognitive abilities
artificial intelligence is a method of
making computer a control robot or a
software think intelligently like the
human mind AI accomplished by studying
the patterns of the human brains and by
analyzing the cognitive process the
outcome of these studies develops
intelligence software and systems so now
moving forward let's see how does AI
work so let's take chat GPT example and
see how does AI work chat gbt operates
as an aid driven chatboard utilizing
natural language processing and machine
learning algorithms to engage with users
so what differentiates chity from other
chat boards in adeptness in grasping
context and Furnishing relevant
responses this proficiency enables it to
offers assistant tailor to users queries
and needs making it an invaluable tool
for diverse application unlike search
engine like Google which primarily
retrieve web pages and articles related
to search queries chity focuses on
understanding the intent behind the user
question and providing appropriate
responses while Google returns search
result based on keyword matches chat GP
generates responses based on the context
and the meaning of query offering more
personalized and conversational
interaction the acronym gbt and chat gbt
stand for generative pre-trained
Transformer highlighting its capability
to generate responses the model is
pre-trained using the amount of text
Data from sources like books web pages
news articles and scientific journals
developed by open AI the model employs a
neural network architecture known as the
Transformer to process input text and
generate coherent and natural sounding
responses to understand how chity works
it is essential to recognize its
training process initially human trainer
provide conversational data guiding the
model to produce humanlike responses
through supervised learning the model
learns to associate inputs with
appropriate outputs refining its
conversational abilities subsequently
reinforcement learning for the enhances
by the model performance by enabling it
to learn patterns and relationships in
tax data autonomously so chat gpt's
neural network takes in a string of text
as input and generates a response as
output however as with most AI models
neural network with essentially complex
mathematical function that require
numerical data as input so to achieve
this each word in chity vocabulary is
assigned a unique set of number to
create a sequence of number that can be
processed by the network with this
process sh gbt can understand and
respond to various inquiries with
varying degrees of success depending on
its training so moving forward now see
application of AI so AI is everywhere so
here are the top applications of AI
first one is virtual personal assistant
virtual personal assistant like Ci Alexa
and Google Assistant utilize AI to
understand and respond to user commands
shedules set reminders and answer
question the second one is
recommendation system AI poers
recommendation system used by companies
like Netflix Amazon and Spotify to
suggest personalized content to user
base on their past behavior and
preferences enhancing user experience
and increasing engagement the third one
is Healthcare AI is roling healthare by
enabling medical professionals to
analyze large amount of patient data
diagnosing diseases more accurately
predict patient outcomes and personalize
treatment plans application include
medical imaging analysis drug Discovery
and virtual Health assistance the last
one is autonomous vehicles AI plays a
crucial role in autonomous vehicles
enabling them to perceive their
surroundings make decisions and navigate
safely without human interven AI
algorithm process data from sensor such
as cameras ladar andro to detect
obstacle interpret traffic science and
plan routes so now let's see some
advantages and disadvantages of AI so

represent in the data they trained on
leading to discriminatory outcome and
decision making process the third one is
personalization AI enables personalized
experience for user by analyzing their
preferences and behavior leading to
tailor recommendation and services the
third
disadvantages privacy concern AI system
May collect and analyze vast amount of
personal data raising concern about
privacy and data security the fourth one
is accessibility AI technology can

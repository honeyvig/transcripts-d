hey guys sorry about that it was a
little bit of Internet connectivity
issues on our end apologize don't
but we're here with Rachel are you doing
I'm doing well
alright Rachel sees from jetbrains and
you're gonna actually save the best for
last I think personally yeah so you're
gonna talk about how to design and
develop like excessively yes s ability
wait yes yes okay oh that's good cool
very cool um so why don't you just take
it away all right sure
so this talk title is be an ally and
with Ally it is often abbreviated as a
11y for accessibility and you'll see
this in a few different areas so that's
a popular nomenclature in accessibility
design so what we're gonna do is talk
about a few things since we only have 30
minutes that you can do that are pretty
easy to be able to make your site
accessible for many many users out there
and I'll let you know why and how as we
go on so first off why should we care
about accessibility because it is much
more than a disabled parking spot right
and a little sticker in the car window
that's the first thing everyone thinks
about accessibility well we have a
parking spot out front aren't we good
nobody thinks about it on the web and it
is actually very very important think
about it on the web and in apps as well
a lot of this applies in both lands web
and in so it is the right thing to do
and you know it right don't pretend you
don't you do right it's the right thing
to do you are able to reach all the
people you need to reach even the people
that it might be difficult to reach if
you're not convinced about that you or a
loved one absolutely will in your life
have an accessible need
many people do now as staggering number
of people but at some point it's gonna
be you everybody dies and if you think
you're not going to you're probably
delusional enough that maybe software
also isn't for you right that's that's
we're going to die I hate to tell you
about that and end-of-life is going to
be a time when you really really really
need accessibility along with illness
accidents and lots of other things that
happen in life including aging as well
so if you live a nice long not life to
90 that's awesome but you're gonna need
a little help
still not convinced how's this alright
there's money in this so you're doing
the right thing and you could end up
with a pile of cash how's that because
over a billion people with 1.2 trillion
dollars of disposable income have
accessible needs and when you
incorporate in their loved ones that
goes up to 8 trillion so is that good
enough for you if you're all like hey
you're being all PC with this right
thing to do and blah blah blah well how
about the money then right do it for the
money at least alright so there's a good
reason and this is from Forrester in the
US there's 60 2.8 million Americans that
require assistive technology so even if
you're like well I don't do stuff
worldwide you only need to do stuff for
the USA well great but that's still a
lot of people right if that's a dollar a
person of revenue you have that's a lot
of money there's very many different
categories of things that people need
for accessibility needs 25% have a
vision difficulty order also have
dexterity difficulties and we have
hearing difficulties 35% of
entrepreneurs are dyslexic and 20 in the
UK so that's a few stats
mostly from the American side of things
that translates out to a lot of cash as
well and of course those baby boomers
right and then following them what is a
Gen X after that or something they have
over 65 they're rising medicines getting
better so even though we are still going
to die we're you know you're gonna get
pretty old and what happens when you get
old you're gonna have to face this you
may lose short-term memory vision
hearing fine motor function things that
today's technology rehire all right so
those things gets a little bit harder
when you get older and I can vouch for
this myself you know I'm up getting
there an old person territory and I
noticed it's harder to you know
fine-tune stop laughing at me better so
like I noticed it's harder to fine-tune
click on you know an exact pixel with
the mouse or even a trackpad and things
you know I I need to do the thing with
the glasses where you have to take them
off to read something in front of your
nose or you have to stretch your hand
out really to see something on
your phone so those guys you know I
actually had the talk about progressive
lenses with the ophthalmologist is like
that milestone that you're gonna get
there and it might not be vision but it
will be so so okay you say well you know
but that's that's the thing there's
better glasses out there and whatnot but
look at here's what customers want as
far as accessibility goes right what
they want is not better glasses per se
and have you looked at prices of glasses
in the US these things are expensive but
what they want isn't necessarily
newfangled
accessibility technology but they want
you to write better software imagine
this as software developers you may have
heard this before right people want
better saw
we're and accessibility is a big part of
what they want so and in this case the
last this might not be the most recent
poll but it's just you know going in
that direction still over 80 percent
wanted more accessible websites because
developers like flashy things are more
interested in clean code and that is a
great thing to do but then you do it at
the expense of people actually being
able to use your software and it's been
said shipping as a feature shipping for
everybody should also be a feature so
the types of accessible needs there's
four general categories visual auditory
motor and cognitive the bulk of your
work if you're a developer is going to
be in the visual area because the web is
very largely visual but there are a few
things you can consider maybe not so
much coding practices but consider for
the other three there will be some
coding practices
the first thing we'll take a look at is
that access assistive technology so
there is a picture of me on the Left
where somebody else took a picture of me
highlighting the menu with the phone
because the old person can't see it it
was dark
how many times did somebody do this out
at dinner right you have to highlight
the menu or even trackpads guess why
there even a thing oh sure it wasn't
just a cool thing it was for accessible
needs and of course glasses a lot of
people say but but I'm really young and
I don't need them and they're wearing
glasses and I'm like but you're actually
wearing the assistive technology now
right as I am glasses and all I still
can't see the menu so sometimes you're
already using the assistive technology
and you don't even know it did you use
an escalator today guess what that's
technically an assistive technology it's
not always high tech it's not always a
spaceship the ones that we tend to think
of and we think of like a disability or
something about accessibility or things
like the screen readers
Braille readers those kind of things
maybe a like a Braille reader sip and
puff switch single access switches eye
tracking eyeglasses or adaptive
keyboards so there's a few examples of
the technology that many people are
using to access your software and you
might not even know it all right we do
have these people and they may be
struggling to use your software and in
many many cases they end up being so
frustrated that they just abandoned
popular sites and I remember looking
into some data with mobile app
development a while back when
smartphones were becoming kind of a
thing and they said like look if the
page takes more than two seconds to load
like 70 some percent of the users just
dump it and they're like and they just
go somewhere else they won't download
the page they won't surf they're there
they're dumb even on a regular computer
how many times it takes more than two
seconds to load right so people get
frustrated quickly with technology
especially people who may not have
wanted to use it in the first place and
they have you and if you don't perform
well they're not going to use it right
so these are things we have to consider
these people are your users whether or
not you planned for it they are or at
least they're trying to be but you might
be losing them and with that a lot of
money
Xbox knows this so that's one of the
adaptive controllers for Xbox right for
accessibility needs and one of the
designers talking about it and there's
the tweet DEP that goes - let's take a
look specifically now at these
categories will start with visual which
there's four kind of areas inside of
their low vision so that would be me a
standard you know I'm getting all their
Gansey stuff then blindness color
blindness and color contrast sensitivity
now you could consider yourself
perfectly not disabled what so
but color contrast is something that
tends to hit everybody if you have bad
contrast nobody can read your stuff or
they can but it's it's literally painful
for some people so one thing that we
have is screen narrators so I have my
Mac here so I have voiceover which works
pretty well but also there's NVDA very
popular web anywhere also a couple of
browser specific ones voiceover not
browser specific that little point just
got tabbed in a bit so we do have these
various screen readers these are
generally free there's also some
experimental ones and some that you can
pay for as well but if you want to test
and just get a feel for what it's like I
highly suggest people do this download
like NVDA or web anywhere or if you have
a Mac use Apple voiceover go browse the
web with your eyes closed and see how
far you get see if you can understand
even a simple page that you use every
day and what's going on if you lost your
site tomorrow would you be able to use
their sites and you're gonna find out
that the answer to this is no in many
many instances so we will work with them
at some point or you should have people
that test with them at some point and if
possible visually impaired people so the
first thing that we can do to help
screen narrators is this thing called a
skip link now what could be more
annoying if you cannot see a page and
you know pages are full of things
nowadays they're not a tiny little page
with just four or five blinking elements
like they were decades ago there's just
all kind of content things popping up
ads here and there you know even if you
have an ad blocker sometimes things
squeak through and there's a lot of
links and what happens is when the user
enters a page the narrator not all
narrators they don't all work exactly
the same but many of
them will read off the top bar of links
or the side bar of links and when they
do that it'll read it off and then they
click on a link and go to that page and
then they have to read those links again
before it gets to the content and then
if they go somewhere else it rates the
links again and this gets to be annoying
pretty quickly so something you might
consider is skip links now some of the
assistive technologies getting a little
bit better in that they are able to
figure out with semantic hTML that there
is a section of links and they just skip
over it but just like with accessibility
you do have to support older browsers as
well so if you're still supporting IE 8
and some of those older browsers you
might need to have skip links for those
newer stuff and newer designs you know
using html5 semantic web that sort of
thing is generally a little bit better
in this category but we still got to
support the old stuff and it's easy
enough here's what you do the first
thing that shows up in a page is going
to be an anchor and it's gonna have its
href set to a named area or named link
then somewhere in the page where if
somebody would be able to skip over the
navigation bar and go to you have that
named area or link in the page so here
in the sample you know I just have a
class that's a skip to main content and
then the main content which is either a
named link or a semantic main tag either
one works so this when this happens then
the screen narrow reader can sit on the
skip link and then that person that is
not cited well can then hit the tab key
and then just skip down to the content
just go right past all of the links now
a few things you could do with this one
is if you have the links present and
visible fine that's great but sometimes
people have links not necessarily as the
first set of things in the page because
it does have to be right up there in the
beginning so what we might want to do is
a little bit of a small hack and that is
to put the links in the beginning but to
make them hidden now when you make them
hidden you just make them a one pixel
wide one pixel high and set the left way
out into left field so there it's like
minus ten thousand then this way it'll
just push the links out but still in the
Dom because if you set visibility to
hidden then it won't screen narrators
won't pick it up if you said you know
any kind of the visible properties it
won't if you set the width and height to
zero it won't pick it up so you want
screen narrators to pick it up so if you
set CSS for those links then you can
just shove them out in left field
they're out of sight but the screen
narrarator can read it and then people
could skip over it now if you're using
something like bootstrap and if you're
using if you're a dotnet person which
you probably are if you're here at
dotnet conf then with bootstrap they
have an SR - only class and with that
you could just set your nav portion like
the whole div that contains your links
to that and that will hide it if you
need to there's also some landmarks that
you can use if there's no semantic HTML
and you have a very very old site with
mostly old browsers to use so skip links
are pretty easy you can just do an SR
only in there so that's just a little
bit of HTML if I go and I take a look at
say a razor pages sample like a small
braid your razor pages website and they
go into the layout page here's where you
can actually put something like that
I might have my div with a couple of
links inside of it and I could class
that as s are only because this uses
bootstrap right so then that would pick
that up if I didn't want to do that
that's fine here we're using nav anyway
so nav is semantic HTML so that should
work just fine so here I have my
different links and bootstrap and pick
that up and decide if it needs to
display or skip or whatever so that'll
be good for the screen readers also you
notice things like main and other you
know footer header those semantic
elements having nose helps with the
screen narrators there's also an
accessibility plug-in for bootstrap so
that will help you along with that past
screen narrators there is much more you
could do but we only have 30 minutes so
we'll take a look at these other factors
here like color blindness here's a
really easy low-hanging fruit thing you
could do download this thing called
color Oracle and when you do that I
could come over and take whatever sample
webpage that I want and let me run this
and then what you could do with color
Oracle and I think I'm gonna have to go
maybe launch my color Oracle
and now I can't find it
oh here it is there it is so it should
show in windows in your tray and Mac
it'll show up in in the Little Mac area
here and what you could do is here I
have several colors right your classic
red blue green yellow right right out of
the rainbow and once I have that page up
I can just click on color Oracle and
then I could pick one of the different
color blindness ha's that are available
and it'll show me what it looks like to
those people so something we could see
here just by kind of scanning through
the different colorblindness --is that
we have right lacking red black and blue
lacking green etc is that a lot of
people on a lot of websites we use a
green button for okay and a red button
for cancel but if you do that they don't
look at all like this or maybe up to
five percent of the population and if
you take say the US has 330 million
people so that's a lot of people that's
several million people that don't see
hunter green and it looks like these
colors here so you might want to
consider not using color as the primary
indicator of what something does use you
can have color in your buttons or
whatever but also use text or something
else to denote what it does so you can
get this nice little tool and then you
can run this through any web page to see
what it's like as a matter of fact
Facebook is blue the color about it is
because Mark Zuckerberg has one of the
colorblindness is there's also a cool
accessibility color wheel tool so
designers and developers can work
together on this one and you just pick
out your foreground and background and
it'll tell you if it's good or not and
you can pick out different contrasts and
in it you know adheres to WCAG and all
that good stuff so that's a nice easy
tool to use and there's also a
colorblindness simulator so you can
go to the simulator and it does
something similar to what the color
Oracle does but here you can take a
sample photo and you can just click
around in it and see what it looks like
you could upload your own photos so if
you have a photo heavy site that will
give you the view of somebody who has a
color blindness so you can help design
much better now color contrast is
something that affects nearly everybody
so we want to consider what's good
contrast and bad usually nice and light
on dark or nice and dark on light but
also sometimes the colors themselves so
here's bad contrast a lot of people
won't even be able to see this that's
just crap
here's good contrast alright you can see
that here's like yeah it's not great
really that could be way better this is
very good right black on a nice light
blue now this is horrible actually
looking at the monitor I could see it on
my laptop but I literally cannot see any
text on the screen in this studio so
that's terrible contrast there were some
good contrast right and then again this
is just so bad your eyes are bleeding at
this point like this and I see this
everywhere if you do this you're a
terrible person I'm sorry that is just
awful
here's good contrast hmm and then just
another man that's it like light gray on
white I know that's popular it's not the
greatest though these red on white is
good but if you look at some of them
like that red on the green it actually
hurts your eyes when you look at it look
if your software is physically hurting
people
you're a jerk like stop it that is just
not cool alright so look at these things
and use say the color contrast contrast
tool from webaim
and that will help you sort out your
colors and if your designer did that go
give them a slap that's not right they
shouldn't be doing that
as far as screen readers go so you can
take any screen reader and kind of
practice with it
so if we are using things like semantic
HTML this helps
now if we're using dotnet also not only
do the templates for the asp net core
and asp net projects have semantic HTML
but when you use data annotations that
produces the correct HTML and javascript
so the screen that narrow readers can
pick that up so if I were to run
something like that and just launch my
site somewhere where I can maybe enter
some data and once I get to here if I go
ahead and open say voiceover okay so we
severed those cool things
oh I forgot to actually there we go
I keep forgetting now it doesn't it
these these are pretty robotic touch to
enter passion in this field
type so this one goes fast because if it
went slow people would be on the page
all day but as you tabbed enrollment age
dev RTD month enrollment to take stepper
hmmm so you'll see it does the oldest
ever inside added text to begin
interacting with the sever press control
option shift down arrow to exit this
date field press control option shift up
arrow okay so as you can see as I go
through and I tab through it starts to
tell you what you're doing and where
you're at and again if you're using like
scaffolding to scaffold your pages like
I did with this one and data annotations
this is gonna pick all of that up and
it's going to be able to effectively
read what's on the screen and as you can
see even though it's for folks with
sighted disabilities it does give you a
little blurb at the bottom in text as
well and so if I look at my data
annotations tell that's much wider
project system preferences except okay
we don't need it to narrate inside of
writer or anything
we're good so here right in my model all
right I can come in here and just set
the datatypes correctly so I have dates
and it knows it's just a date not the
time as well and the display name so it
the screen reader can pick that up and
in annotations that just gives us all of
the information when it produces the
rendered output screen narrators are
very happy about that so there I have
those so that works out really good for
accessible forms so you could see we'll
take a look at the form here if you have
things like the checkboxes and lists and
grouped items you could use the field
set and legend but in this case I didn't
have any I just had a just plain form
and a couple of divs that were grouped
here so there's one grouping for the
name one for the enrollment date one for
the expected graduation date for these
students and something that I did here
on purpose so we could see how it works
if you notice all of these except the
last one have the label right so that's
a semantic HTML element and the label
tells a screen narrator what this is
about
so previous days we would just use a
span or some other kind of little tag to
be able to kind of label our input
elements but now what we could do see
input and then use our s before and then
go ahead and say label ASP four and
point that to our input right we're
actually the same actual model item
right so a little object right out of
the model and then that's all gonna work
seamlessly together for us and I really
I didn't have to do anything this was
all created when I ran scaffolding
actually really you'd get free stuff
here it's a boatload of free stuff now I
came in here and I removed this label so
what would happen if I remove this label
and I get to that element so if I come
back here and turn on boom - voiceover
back on recipe voiced over us in Chrome
and attacks blank that's it we're
currently on a text field thank you and
you're touched in this field type thanks
yeah very a text field
what textfield I don't know it's not
labeled I took the label out so even if
there's some text ahead of there the
narrator might not pick that up or know
it might see the text but it won't know
that it belongs to this textbox so it
just goes at a text field you're on a
text field yeah thanks thanks for that
that's not helpful whatsoever so you
want to use the labels and appropriate
scaffolding yeah and you can see how
annoying this can get if you are
somebody with sighted needs right so
there we have the label again and also
some things that we tend to do people
tend to put a tiny little star and
that's all - Dino required and they'll
make it read which is to bad things
right the read Because are color blind
folks can't see it also it's tiny a tiny
star that sometimes looks like a speck
of dust on the screen so you know other
sighted needs can't see it so what we
might want to do if you're actually
gonna use the word required or if you're
gonna actually denote that something is
required instead of waiting for them to
get to the end and then popping up the
messages then you could actually just
put the word required or something
that's a little bit more clear than the
star so that tends to be much more
helpful there's also a little tool tip
that you can create and the O AAA
accessibility project has that available
so you could go there and they have some
sample HTML to pop up a tooltip and then
of course the folks in the accessibility
circles argue our tooltips really
accessible but these are built pretty
well so they don't get in the way
the other thing with accessible forms
you will see something called Aria now
area was more needed in the past you
will need it today once in a while when
semantic hTML is not really relevant for
what you're doing or if you have to
support some of the older browsers or
browsers that don't support html5 right
so if that happens you may need some of
these Aria tags as technology is
evolving these tend to be going away a
little bit so you can set an aria
required if you needed to do that and
that would give the screen narrator a
little assist and would say oh yeah yeah
I see that's required I can tell the
user that and there's a full set of Aria
attributes that you can apply to any
HTML tag and of course that also works
for any raiser markup as well and they
have roles States properties as well so
you can say if things are disabled or if
it's supposed to be navigation versus
content required etc so it just helps
the narrator's you will the narration so
you'll see a few of these in the
templates or asp net court projects with
Razer pages now there's more things you
can do for sighted people or people with
sighted issues that's just a few of the
big bangs for the buck it's not a lot of
coding to do but it helps tremendously
so we'll go into auditory and the next
three categories are a lot less coding
but just being aware of what's happening
out there and who is accessing your
software so auditory is mild hearing
loss to total deafness so that's
generally what that is now some things
just to take note of don't rely only on
sounds for feedback that does happen
sometimes it happens in games or more an
app development desktop kind of stuff
use transcripts and closed captioning
wherever possible because not everybody
could hear actually I'm seeing many many
more people who can hear perfectly well
and they say I actually prefer to just
not blast the TV and I like to have
closed captioning on or folks who are
learning languages just like to run
captions as well and it helps out a
little bit to hear it and to read it at
the same time know about Deaf culture
there it is such a thing right sign
language is there in snot sign language
it's sign languages there are dialects
and sign languages and people do have
accents in sign language so if you do
get interpreters that do signing that's
just something to consider right that it
that's out there so you might have a
signer for one of your videos or
something like that but they may have an
accent or something and if they're not
from your area and you're localized some
people might notice that so just so you
know it's available out there the motor
and dexterity issues all right so this
is generally illness injury disease
there's many if you think about it
things like epilepsy and seizure
disorders right a lot of websites have
like a loud you know pulsating weird
like psychedelic stuff going on and it
just like kind of goes all over the
place and people actually have seizures
I know the Simpsons did an episode and
they kind of like made a big joke about
it but it seriously actually happens
they're also motor dexterity as you get
older if you look at many of us have you
know very aging parents and they have
tremors essential tremor or something
anybody of any age can have plus actual
diseases like Parkinson's and whatnot
you can have dexterity issues and
something I see this drives me up the
wall and I'm not the only one you'll go
to a popular website and they'll pop up
an ad well first of all the fact that
it's an ad raise it just
right there it's so annoying but then
they'll make the close button like to a
two pixel by two pixel button and you
basically have to be a surgeon to be
able to click on that button and it is
really annoying and then people just go
forget this and they just don't come
back to your site so where you think
you're being clever and you're trapping
them in there they're just going like f
you and they're going to another site
because you've just made them very very
angry so so all these things can you all
these kind of people are using your
software arthritis how arthritis is
super common lots of people have
arthritis and it actually sometimes
painful to try to click on that little
square or to try to use just the mouse
so make sure there's always alternative
keyboard input right so that's something
and that the tab order is not ridiculous
that it goes in a logical fashion people
forget to check the tab borders on forms
also temporarily like I said in the
beginning you will at some point or a
loved one will have these needs you
break a bone that's very common people
that happens you break a bone that can
cause an impact on your technology use
also sprains and lots of other stuff
right people even just get you know
frozen shoulders or lots of joint
problems and it's just part of Aging or
injury and then from that just makes it
a little harder to use devices alright
so phones computers or anything so make
sure also alt right so alternate
keyboard and alt in images as well so
lots of things avoid pop-ups and modal
dialogs unless they're easy to get out
of nice big closed buttons or where
somebody can just click away or move
away and it easily goes away cognitive
impairments as well are very common
everything from just you know memories
not so good anymore it's you know also
an aging issue
remember the millions of people in the
u.s. autism seizures just comprehension
and learning disabilities dyslexia ad D
that's very very common so these are all
users all right so if you look at this
this is a significant portion of the
population between visual auditory
dexterity and cognitive right you're
talking like a quarter of the population
at any given time all the way up to
almost 40% in some areas so that was a
huge chunk that has something going on
or multiple things from these areas
going on so that's something so there's
no tools to help people with the
cognitive disability for you to write
code to make it easier for them what you
need to do though is just keep things
clear and simple right which as a
programmer you are supposed to be doing
right there is a kiss principle and
you're supposed to be doing it in your
code and it should be in your product as
well but also programmers tend to you
know poopoo the UX all right like it's
not my job and stuff like that but it
kind of is you're building the product
and people are using it and if they
can't you are partly responsible so you
need to make sure that comprehensive UX
testing gets done and not just with two
people who you think are the average
user you need to get a nice variety of
users in there because of these massive
percentages of people with various
disabilities right so no tools per se to
help just that you need to keep things
in order keep it clear and simple keep
it easy to use listen to your users when
they say this is not easy to use
something that's not usually categorized
as a disability but it is an interesting
thing that researchers have found as
part of the human spectrum of being and
living and that is the thing called
synesthesia so there are these number of
synesthetes out there with these various
ways that they experience the world that
is different from what you would use or
call in quotes normal one of them is the
grapheme-color synesthesia which is the
picture that colored picture and when
whenever somebody talks about numbers if
they said picture 1 to 100 that is what
would show up in their head the one also
to the right is the spatial signal
sequence synesthesia and I actually have
that right so when I see numbers I see
them in a certain knot with the cool
colors though but I do see them in
certain patterns or ladders and time
dates and times I see in like circular
patterns when that's how I experience
time so people experience things
differently other ones like when they
hear sounds they experience a color or
taste and often letters like I have the
word synesthesia somebody might see
every s is read every you know H is
purple and it'll be consistent right so
every time they will so you might be
reading black on white text somebody
else might see a pretty big rainbow
going through a page of a book so
there's all these different ways that
people just simply experience the world
not a disability is just a different way
to experience which is also how I see
autism just a different way to
experience the world right so a lot of
these things also when people sometimes
when they touch things different
textures they will feel a taste or feel
a taste they will taste something when
they feel a texture or you know when
they hear certain sounds they might have
a taste like so all kind of these weird
and different kind of crossed
perceptions so those are those four main
categories and some things you can do as
a programmer as far as some general
tools to help us out
web aim is where you want to go this is
a good one-stop place to go so if you go
to web aim they have this cool thing
called a wave scanner so you could go
plunk in a URL you can even download
this as a toolkit and it will just go
through and tell you all the things that
are you know that you can
change to make it more accessible looks
for alt tags and all kind of interesting
and cool stuff all right so you can just
pop in a website and see what it says so
I could even like pop in my own blog
here and then give it a second and it'll
parse it and then come up with some
ideas so here it'll actually give you
errors alerts tells you where you're
using Aria and not and some things that
you can do better
all rights that you have in here so
that's a very handy tool there's also
the web content accessibility guidelines
they have a checklist so when you go to
publish you can go through the checklist
see what's out there
also depending on where you live and
what sector you're in if you're in
government most certainly you have to do
this so it just depends
there's section 508 for the US and
Europe has some rules about this too and
also the wk2 checklist so there's two of
them is that you can use in there the
bottom one is a little bit newer but
these are checklists that just allow you
to go through and make sure that you
have everything that you shoe it and get
all your ducks in a row you can actually
say Oh make sure I have alternative text
make sure everything is clear I have my
alt attributes and here's inputs have
labels deform buttons have a descriptive
value so all these cool little things so
you don't forget right so that's very
very handy as well so I like that quite
a bit
so web aim in general is just a really
good place to go there's also the ally
project so if you just look for a 11y
project the first thing that pops up and
they have all kind of cool samples and
things like that and places you could go
to to do a little bit more coding and
much more than we could possibly talk
about here and a half an hour which I'm
probably
okay so some final thoughts on this also
right and this is right from web content
accessibility for the love of God and
all that is holy get over yourself
stop dragging your heels and make the
hit you create accessible bleep and
seriously actually freaking care about
it as well
yeah it's gonna get played okay so
really this is what WK finally got fed
up with all your BS developers because
you don't do any of this for any people
just let this you know to the last thing
if they even get around to it but a lot
of people simply can't even use your
software at all so like I said if you
don't care about the right thing to do
or that it might even affect you if you
think it won't how about the money go
after the money alright and W CAG wants
you to do it as well so it's right up
there on their on their check or on
their wish list and their actual traffic
specs which i think is kind of hilarious
but sad that it needed to be said right
in here I gave you just a few simple
things you can do that will really
enhance accessibility in your projects
and there's of course a lot more you can
do if you go to webaim you'll find that
out I think I'm pretty much done there
wait
we do have a couple questions yep let's
go it's just a couple here one here
actually is bringing the chat window
they are question the Google live
transcribe app is awesome are there any
other available to be used in Windows or
the browser extension the Google live
transcript app transcribed
o transcribe app I'm not sure if there's
a comparable piece of software out there
for that particular okay another one I
got in a whisper was was a bear I'm
gonna ask you to verify a link I guess
for they were asking about an
accessibility for Windows apps okay
because you talked a lot about web apps
off yeah all about web apps and I was
wondering if you know was there a more
up-to-date piece of software the I mean
piece of dock
patient than the one here that looks
fairly old to me to helix a lot of these
design concepts are sort of they sort of
like live longer than the operators
that's what I was gonna say yes it's a
design concept yep so I was actually
gonna when you started talking about
windows point it to the actual windows
[Laughter]
just making sure I didn't mess this all
up I guess II know number three so yeah
so sounds like that was anyway yeah like
give them everything that they need
because a lot of that does have to do
with design and look and whatnot sorry
that should help
awesome all right that's about it so I
want before we wrap it up first of all I
say thank you very much for me wrap this
whole show up I gave what I say thank
you so much to all of the people who
have stuck through the whole show all
the way the end even a half an hour late
okay we actually have a couple awesome
people like literally the average like
duration of time watch I have a couple
stats here of the whole entire show two
hundred and sixty five minutes and
TriNet a Trinidad and Tobago like they
all like all three people watch the show
like days oh and I wanted to thank you
the second Cabo Verde and the third Isle
of Man fourth Kenya at a hundred and
twenty two minutes straight watch so
those were long you know one full
session to be fair though Isle of Man
yes it's probably one mile yeah
I don't know literally a just a man
that's it yeah just next to England
everybody else is on the main England
I'm hoping I'm so anyways great show
everybody and resue / appreciated ha BR
get into the shot here you've been the
man man run in this hole twitch thing to
you and Jeff yes to twitchcon right yeah
Jeff dumped up yeah you know he totally
dumped us for twitchcon but that's cool
because we need him to create some more
mods for our awesome twitch stream for
you right so huge thanks to everybody
who tuned in on all three days thank you
so much for making this fun this is year
number six for does right so yeah so
this is your number nine for the virtual
ones so next year we got our big number
ten come over here mister big party next
year yes yes starting the year nine
years so and thank you for actually
building a product this year we had a
launch event so thank you so much for
coming you made it successful that's the
best one yet
Thanks thank so much so yeah I gotta
push the camera
[Laughter]

hey everyone i am bravo khandelwal and i
welcome you all to our simply learns
youtube channel today we'll talk about c
sharp web services but first let me
remind you that we have our daily
updates on numerous technologies so if
you are a tech geek looking for the
latest technological innovation then try

youtube channel
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session we will begin our session with
the discussion on what are c sharp web
services
then we will have a brief discussion on
technologies that support
said c-sharp web services
following that we will try to implement
the c web services in the use visual
studio
then we will have a discussion on the
advantages and disadvantages of web
services
finally we will conclude this session
with a few takeaways on c-sharp web
services
now let's start with what are c-sharp
web services
a web service is a web-based feature
that is accessed by a web protocols and
used by online applications
web services aren't only for the dot net
framework platform
the standards were created before the
debut of dotnet
and they are exposed utilized and
supported by companies other than
microsoft
web services across platform
which means that a service developed in
one language may be invoked by another
language written in an application
the sole prerequisite for using a
service is an internet connection to
send an http request
web services are triggered by other
programs
when html pages are displayed in a
browser for the end user
now after understanding the c-sharp web
services
let's discuss the technologies that
support web services
first we have xml
then we have soap
then we have wsdl then at last we have
uddi
now let's discuss each of them in detail
first xml
web services just
specify the data
as a result the applications that
understand the xml
in terms of programming language or a
platform can format the xml in many ways
next we have soap
soap establishes a communication between
services and the application
the wsdl provides us consistent
technology
for specifying web services to other
applications
at last we have uddi
uddi may search the web service
registration using uddi
next let's try implement this in the
visual studio
now let's start by creating a new
project
we will go ahead and use asp.net web
application with the dot minute
framework in brackets
here if you come next
we will name this as
simply learn
web
services
then we will hit click
we will choose empty
and hit create
make sure you use the dotnet framework
4.7.2
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
now let's create a web service
so i will right click on project name i
will add a new item
here we will search for a web service
asmx
that is this one
we will name this one
as simply
learn
service
i will click on add
and here we have our first web service
so to start with we have to allow a web
service to be called from a script using
asp.net as x
so to do that we need to uncomment the
following line so we will go ahead and
uncomment this line
next
we will go ahead and make our own web
method
so for the first method
let's make a public
sum
then in bracket i will have int
x
comma
in
y
then
we will have
return
x
plus
y
now we have to make sure that we are not
using the same variables or the methods
again and again
so to make sure that we will add
something called a message name
so
and the brackets we will have some of
numbers
i forgot to add end here
now this is a complete web method
since a web service does not allow
method overloading so we need to use
message names
in case if we want to re-utilize these
variables
so let's create few more functions so i
will just copy this one
and paste
next i will have
difference
between
numbers
i will change this function name
to
difference
and i will change it here
to minus
let's make a product
and a division as well so copy this
so for this one i will have
product
of numbers
i will change this here
as
product
and here i will have
for this one i will have division
for the method name
we will again have
division
name
then
here
now let's save it and run it
here wait for it to run
now we are waiting for room to load up
this service
and here we have
first web service page
if you look closely we are using
temporary.org as its default name space
we can change the different name space
using xml web services if it is made
public
so now let's check our service
description
it is basically a formal description
which has
a complete web-based data
now let's go back and work on our
function
these are the functions which are auto
ordered according to the names
if you check its message name we have
different
part is basically to specify we have
made spaces between these words
so if you don't make spaces
this will not show
now let's run one
each of them one by one so we will go
with difference
here let's add
23
then we can have 13
let's invoke it
and as you can see we are getting 10.
next
let's close this one
and go back to our complete list we'll
go to division
let's make it
30
and divided by 3
we will invoke it
we are again getting 10
then we can go
to product
we can go for
200
multiplied by 20
the failure was 4000
as you can see we are getting 4 000
we can go for sum
we can add any random number here
for the sum
so let's select for x so any number
then for the y we can choose any number
and we will click and go
and as you can see we are getting this
number
so now let's get back to our slides
and continue with our slides
now let's go over the advantages of
c-sharp web services
first we have the open text-based
standard is always used by web services
all of those components are used by web
services
even if they are built in different
languages for different platforms
the web services are simple to develop
yet closely since they rely on existing
infrastructures and we can repackage
most of the applications as web services
web services is an interoperable
organization with hundred suppliers that
prefer interoperability
web service encourage a modular approach
to development so that the various web
businesses can connect with the same web
service
web services lower the cost of
enterprise application integration and
business to business interaction
now let's discuss the disadvantages of c
sharp web services
if we employ a web service for high
performance situation then the web
service will get sluggish
to describe the quality of certain
online services we use a consistent
process
the vendor's ability to keep the
intellectual property of a given
standard is also a restriction of the
web service
finally let's conclude this session with
a few pointers on web services
first web service isn't really reliant
on any one language
next a web service a protocol agnostic
that is it does not rely on any protocol
then we have a web service is a platform
agnostic as well that is it does not
rely on any platform
finally we have stateless architecture
which refers to web services these
services rely only on the information
provided

going to focus on the roles and
responsibilities of a business
analyst let's start off and have a look
at a day in the life of a business
analyst through a small story so meet
Angela who is working as a business
analyst in an application development
firm her firm builds applications for
clients depending on their requirements
our next character is Rob he is a
butting entrepreneur with a vision of
setting up his own e-commerce app he
plans on selling several electronic
gadgets like phones laptops cameras Etc
on his app so what is Rob's First Step
well he approaches Angela's firm one day
with the vision of creating his
e-commerce app Angela and Rob start
talking business and Angela promises to
help Rob with his app creation she
assures him that she will look into his
business requirements and coordinate
with him to get the app running Rob is
happy about it and agrees to cooperate
with Angela regarding all the business
requirements from his end Angela as we
know is the business analyst she starts
planning Rob's project and without any
delay she embarks on this Project's
Journey she has a set of planned steps
that will help her fulfill Rob's
requirements but what are the steps she
takes is her approach going to be
effective and quick let's find out the
answers to these questions now up next
you can learn about Angela's approach
that helps her deliver Rob's project
smoothly and without any hassles these
steps that we are going to look at are
the typical roles and responsibilities
of a business analyst here we will
understand these roles better with
respect to Angela's and Rob story first
and foremost Angela understands Rob's
business objectives problems and
requirements without understanding this
do you think Angela will be able to
proceed no hence a business analyst like
Angela understands the problems related
to Rob's business and comes up with the
right solution to achieve the goals of
the business she brainstorms around what
is best Ed for an e-commerce app
focusing on electronic Gadgets in The
Next Step Angela gathers all the
necessary requirements here she
understands Rob's requirements and makes
sure that they are on the same page
regarding the project and its goals both
of them together arrive at a stipulated
deadline for the project
completion she gathers relevant
information based on security of the app
the payment setup based to login cost of
the products and style to name a few
once Angela has an in-depth
understanding of Rob's project and
gathers all the necessary requirements
she starts allocating Resources by
keeping in mind the budget of the
project here she recognizes and
allocates tasks and resources to the
development team Pas work closely with
the development team to design the
solution for a problem Angela ensures
that the development team doesn't spend
their time understanding Rob's
requirements in this step along with the
development team she finalizes the
software and tools required to build the
project Angela doesn't rest until the
project is delivered to Rob she
continuously monitors the progress and
constantly provides her feedback to the
development team with respect to the
app's layout design and other features
she gives them suggestions in order to
improve the application in The Next Step
Angela collects feedback of the
Prototype ver of the app from the
users she notes down if the Prototype is
fine or if it requires more work p
validate if the project is running fine
with the help of use acceptance testing
they verify if the solution being worked
on is in line with the requirements and
ensure that the final product satisfies
the use
expectations Bas also assess the
functional and non-functional
requirements after collecting feedback
Angela moves to one of her most crucial
duties and that is building reports data
visualization is a key skill for any ba
in order to gauge the performance of the
app and get valuable insights from it
Angela builds reports using various data
visualization tools like Tablo powerbi
and click view reports can be General
reports such as detailed reports or it
can be dashboard reports such as
visualized reports with
multi-dimensional analysis based on
display of business indicators it is not
uncommon for issues to crop up amst this
entire process hence Angela conducts
regular meetings with the development
team and Rob to solve problems quickly
having these meetings will help Rob
understand the status of the project and
it will also help the teams proceed in
the right path throughout this project
phase Angela makes sure to maintain
transparency on completion of the
project Angela documents and presents
the project findings to Rob generally
business analysts present the project
outcomes to the stakeholders and clients
along with maintenance reports Andel are
notes on all the project learnings and
details in a concise manner this will
help her take better decisions in the
future and these documents will save her
time while implementing the next project
now that she has completed all her
duties and responsibilities with respect
to Rob's project she is ready to deliver
the final e-commerce application to Rob
for use Rob is rest assured that the
application developed by Angela's firm
is apt for his business and just what he
wanted Angela's streamlined approach
made it easier for the project to be
delivered within the stipulated time
period Rob is happy and I'm sure he will
come back to Angela's firm for projects
in the future so those responsibilities
that we saw Angela carry out are ideally
the roles and responsibilities for any
business analyst out there yes some may
vary depending on the company you work
for and the project you're working on
before winding up let's just summarize
the role of a business analyst so
firstly we learned that a business
analyst is a professional who Bridges
the gap between the it and the business
teams in an organization they are part
of the business off option and they also
work closely with the technology team to
improve the quality of the services
being delivered they use data analytics
and modern Technologies to improve
processes and Ba's also delivered
datadriven Solutions as seen in Angela's
story she made sure that Rob's
requirements were clearly understood and
fulfilled Bas ensured that the client's
needs are converted rightly into the
final project comprehending customer
needs and interpreting them rightly
holds Paramount importance in the life
of a business analyst Angela wouldn't
have been able to perform her duties
without holding a rich skill set Bas
must know Excel SQL and should have bi
skills to accomplish all their duties
smoothly not to forget a fair amount of
programming knowledge is beneficial for
business analysts is no surprise that
business analytics and business
intelligence are two of the fastest
growing markets in the world
organizations today are generating data
at a rapid rate there is a need to use
this business data and make smarter
decisions companies are looking for
methods and tools to turn business data
into actionable insights this is where
business analytics and intelligence can
help play a critical role business
analytics is the process of collecting
analyzing and drawing valuable
conclusions from vast volumes of data
available it helps to improve business
performance through fact-based decision
making on the other hand business
intelligence or bi is a technology that
enables data preparation data mining
data management and data
visualization it allows you to analyze
data with queries and create reports and
dashboards with the help of charts and
graphs to be used by Business Leaders
business analytics and business
intelligence together create
capabilities for companies to compete in
the market effectively consider this
example suppose you sell homemade
chocolates through an online store
business intelligence provides
meaningful insights into the past and
current state of your business bi tells
you that sales of your milk chocolate
have spiked up in Texas the past 2 weeks
so you decide to manuf facture more milk
chocolates to keep up with demand
business analytics asks why did sales of
milk chocolates Pike up in Texas by
scrutinizing your website data you
learned that most traffic has come from
a post by a food blogger based in Texas
who liked your milk chocolate this
Insight helps you decide to send
complimentary chocolates to a few other
well-known food bloggers throughout the
United States using Cutting Edge
business analytics and intelligence
tools such as Microsoft Excel SQL
powerbi and tblo can enhance customer
experience improve efficiency conduct
competitor analysis and accelerate
growth first of all let's understand
what business Process Management
is business process management or BPM is
an organizational discipline in which a
firm examines all of the operation
processes collectively and individually
through this assessment companies aim to
identify areas of improvement to create
a more efficient and effective business
environment in simple terms business
Process Management is all about
optimizing and improving company's
business processes that serve customers
and eventually bring the pile of Revenue
BPM is vast discipline that by
definition is dynamic given the
continually changing organization roles
regulations method corporate goals and
other Factor it contains BPM has evolved
with time to accept a wide range of
optimization approaches from Sigma and
lean management to Agile we'll discover
these approaches in depth on some other
day first let's dive deep into the
details of BPM if we break down nuts and
bolts of business Process Management
you'll find out three key factors the
first one is of course business
processes the second one will be the set
of inputs and the third one will be the
output retrieved after processing
presented inputs for example consider
the bank loan application process here
the customer will supply an electronic
application form via the bank's website
to receive the desired loan plan let's
say a home loan in this case initially
the input provided by the customer will
go into the loan application process now
the loan process is not one small
process there are multiple operations
and regulations involved in it such as
credit checkups quality control loan
management underwriting Etc all these
tasks are cumulatively considered as
business processes as mentioned earlier
all these processes will start once the
customer provides some sort of input in
this case it is an electronic
application which will be forwarded to
the salesperson by bank's it team by
evaluating the submitted electronic
application A salesperson will formulate
the list of loan products in order to
present them to the customer but if a
customer is interested in some specific
banking product for instance Home Loan
in such a case the salesperson will
provide customer details about home loan
a home loan has certain eligibility
criteria which customer will have to
fulfill so salesperson will ask for
setup documents such as ID proof income
Source or salary sleep property
documents Etc this initial phase of loan
application is also known as
pre-qualification process in the next
phase the administrative team will
evaluate all the documents submitted by
the customer and forward them to the
credit credit analysis te at this point
the credit department receives the
application and the first step is to
analyze it for accuracy genuine and
completeness if all the needed fields
are not filled out the application will
be returned to the borrower or credit
analyst who will contact the borrower to
get the missing information the credit
team uses the loan origination system to
determine a borrower's credit worthiness
a good losos will help A lender Bank set
up work workflows to process a loan it
may automatically flag files that have
missing needed fills return them to the
borrower and tell the sales department
that they need to be rked to manage this
St a new Department of information and
Technology will also come into play this
particular step of application
evaluation is also known as underwriting
process in the next phase the credit
decisions are made if customer fulfills
all required criteria the application
will be approved or if the customer
lacks somewhere the application will be
rejected in the next phase quality
assurance will be achieved because
lending is highly regulated business
Banks rely heavily on the quality check
stage of loan origination process the
application is routed to the quality
assurance team which Compares crucial
variables to internal and external
standards and regulations this is the
final stepe of loan procedure before it
is submitted for funding now consider
all these processes Al together each
process works on feedback of other
process or some new input hence managing
every input and process can increase the
speed of business operation by removing
internal miscommunications service
delays customer complaints Etc and BPM
is the field of management that exactly
Works towards achieving that in short to
Define it in more simple terms I would
say BPM is all about managing multiple
input streams and intercommunication of
business processes to generate desired
business outcome within the least amount
of time possible now let's see what
powerbi is powerbi is a business
analytics service provided by Microsoft
that lets you visualize your data and
share insights it converts data from
different sources to build interactive
dashboards and bi reports as you can see
we have an Excel data about sales using
this data powerbi helps you build
different charts and graphs to visualize
the data now that we have understood
what powerbi is let us look at the
important features of powerbi first is
powerbi desktop powerbi desktop is a
free software that you can download and
it allows you to build reports by
accessing data easily for using powerbi
desktop you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report second as already discussed
powerbi supports stream analytics from
Factory sensors to social media sources
powerbi assists in real-time analytics
to make timely decisions third support
for multiple data sources is one of the
major features of powerbi you can access
various sources of data such as Excel
CSV SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of powerbi while dealing with complex
data powerbi is default standard might
not be enough in some cases in that case
you can access the custom library of
visualization that meets your needs let
us jump into discussing the various
components of powerbi as you can see
there are six major components of
powerbi now let's discuss them one by
one first is power query power query is
the data transformation and mass up
engine it enables you to discover
connect combine and refine data sources
to meet your analysis need it can be
downloaded as an addin for Excel or can
be used as part of powerb desktop second
we have power pivote power pivote is a
data modeling technology that lets you
create data models it also allows you to
establish relationships and create
calculations it uses data analysis
expression language or Dax to model
simple and complex data third we have
power view Power view is a technology
that is available in Excel SharePoint
SQL server and powerbi it lets you
create interactive charts graphs maps
and other visuals that brings your data
to Life Next we have power map
Microsoft's power map for Excel and
powerbi is a 3D data visualization tool
that lets you map your data and plot
more than a million rows of data
visually on Bing maps in 3D format from
an Excel table cable or data model in
Excel then we have powerbi desktop
powerbi desktop is a development tool
for power query power pivote and Power
view with powerbi desktop you have
everything under the same solution and
it is easier to develop b data analysis
experience finally we have power Q&A the
Q&A feature in powerbi lets you explore
your data in your own words it is the
fastest way to get an answer from your
data using natural language an example
could be what was the total sales last
year once you have built your data model
and deployed that into powerbi website
then you can ask questions and get
answers easily now let's see what
powerbi service is powerbi service is
the software as a service part of
powerbi it is also referred as powerbi
online to access powerbi service you
need to log into to app. powerbi.com now
let me show you that I'll go to Google
open a new tab and search for app.
powerbi
. it's
loading this is how the homepage of
powerbi service looks like I've created
some dashboards on it first you need to
log app. powerbi service you can see I'm
logged in now under my workspace if I go
to dashboard here I have created a
finance dashboard you can see the
different charts and graphs I have
prepared and pinned it to the dashboard
so powerbi service allows you to connect
to your data create reports and
dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data now as you can
see in this dashboard we have created
some charts and graphs so this is a tree
map there's a pie chart there's a bar
graph below you can see there are line
charts and donut charts it tells you the
total sales that were made the total
number of unit solds the sales by
product sales by country sales by
segment and lots more one of the key
features of powerbi is creating
dashboards from multiple reports and
data sets powerbi dashboard is a single
page visualization to tell a story The
visualizations on a dashboard are
generated from multiple reports and each
report is based on one data set a single
page dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles these tiles are pinned
to the dashboard by report designers now
let me go back to my dashboard so this
is called a canvas and each of these are
called tiles so on the top you can see
we have three tiles now let's understand
how to create and publish reports in
powerbi dashboard rep powerbi allows you
to create different reports on powerbi
desktop these reports can be published
on the powerbi dashboard using powerbi
service here you can see there is a
powerbi report created on powerbi
desktop if you click on publish it will
take you to the powerbi service where
you can build a dashboard here is the
button for powerbi publish once you
click on powerbi publish it will take
you to the dashboard so this is a single
page powerbi dashboard on powerbi
service now let's understand the powerbi
architecture powerbi architecture is a
service built on top of a z there are
multiple data sources that powerbi can
connect to powerbi desktop allows you to
create reports and data visualizations
on the data set Power VI Gateway is
connected to on premise data sources to
get continuous data for reporting and
analytics powerbi services are basically
the cloud services that are used to
publish powerbi reports and data
visualizations using powerbi mobile apps
you can stay connected to their data
from anywhere powerbi apps are available
for Windows IO and Android platforms now
let's look at a case study on how Meer
which is one of United States largest
Supermarket chains used powerbi to solve
its business problems initially Meer had
become dependent on its it organization
to extract insights from its data it was
time consuming and inefficient as you
had to wait for it to build every report
Meer was unable to perform ad hoc and
realtime analysis easily so what Meer
did was it connected powerbi to an on
premises SQL Server analysis services
Cube this allowed them to refresh 20
billion rows of data in near Real Time
with powerbi teams can now pull in the
data faster and perform real-time
analysis to derive insights from data a
bakery department inside Meer used
powerbi to compare its sales with
regional performance they analyzed where
Meer was behind the regional Trends
focused on the problem and created a
solution with powerbi they can now drill
down into early sales and send out a
sales flash to 800 Mayo Business Leaders
so powerbi enabled them to standardize
data sources and Empower store directors
and team leaders to develop and track
their data to ensure what they can
improve now let's do some practical
Hands-On demo with powerbi so this is
how the powerbi desktop interface looks
like on the left you have the report
view the data View and the model view
the report view is where you visualize
your data with different charts and
graphs to build reports the data view
allows you to view the whole data while
the model view is where you check if
there are any Rel relationship between
the tables on the right you can see the
different visualizations that you can
build we'll quickly run through all of
these in our demo so here you can see
there's a finance sample data that will
help you draw insights about the sale of
products in different countries we will
create a report to visualize different
charts and graphs and analyze those
sales so let me go to my powerb desktop
first we'll import our data so let me go
to our get data Tab and choose Excel as
my data source I click on Excel so here
is our finance sample data
we'll select sheet one you can see the
data here click on it and then select
load this might take some time to load
the data now if I go to my data tab you
can see the entire data set it has
Fields such as segment country in which
the sales was made the name of the
product the unit sold and the sales
price and many more let's start building
our report now I'll go to my report view
so first let me create a text box let me
resize it
let me name it as Finance dashboard
we'll increase the size of the text
we'll use Font consolas Center it we'll
also add a background to this we use
blue color change it to
White and increase the size now let me
first show you how you can create a
matrix I'll go to visualizations and
click on Matrix let me resize
it from the data sheet tab I'll select
sales and drag on to
values so you can see the total number
of sales that we made now let me do some
formatting so I'll go to the format tab
click on column headers let's add a
background color and let me increase the
text size to 20 similarly under values
we'll increase the size of the text to
20 as well we can also click on border
and choose the color of the Border we
take as Let It Be black so this is a
simple Matrix that we created which
shows the total number of seals that
were made similarly let me choose Matrix
once again now we'll drag on the unit
sold onto values we'll continue with the
same drill under column headers We'll
add a background this time let's choose
some other color and under values let's
increase the size of the text to 20 even
for the column headers let's increase
the size of the text to
20 again we'll switch on Border me
resize a
bit so here we have two Matrix created
for our report the first Matrix shows us
the total sales that were made the
second Matrix shows you the total units
that were sold now let's move ahead and
create a simple bar chart so under
visualization I click on clustered
column chart
under this we'll drag the date column
onto access and the sales onto value let
me expand it so it shows you the sales
per year this is the sales that were
made in 2013 and this shows you the
sales that were made in
2014 now there's a drill down option
which gives you more
granularity this depicts the sales back
water if I drill down further you can
see this shows you the sales by month
also you have some option like s bu and
S by sales so you can see October month
made the highest number of sales moving
ahead let me now create a pie chart
where we will see the sales by different
segments under visualization I'll click
on pie chart let me first resize
it here I'll drag the segment column
onto the legend and the sales column
onto the values as you can see we have
the sales made by different segments
government segment made the high highest
number of sales with
44.2% now let me add a border to both
the visualization I'll click on the pie
chart and go to the format tab I'll
switch on the border similarly for the
clustered column chart I'll go to the
format Tab and click on Border let me
resize a bit all right next we'll create
a very simple table that will depict the
total sales made by each product so
under visualizations I click on table
let me bring this below
so from the data sheet I'll first drag
product onto values you can see the
different products and then sales just
below it so this depicts the total sales
that were made by each product and
finally it displays the total value of
the sales that were made this is same as
the one shown here now let's do some
formatting under format tab I'll go to
values and increase the text size to 15
me expand it also under column headers
I'll increase the text size to 15 then
let me go and add a
border now let me create a map that will
show you the sales that were made by
each country so first let me create a
new page and under visualization I'll
click on map now I'll drag the country
column onto
location so you can see we have our map
ready and we'll drag sales onto size you
can see the different countries and the
sales that they made if I move the map
you can see the sales made in the Europe
region let me resize it I'll add a
border to
this now let me go ahead and create a
donut chart that will show you the
profit by each segment under
visualizations I'll click on donut chart
I'll move this to the top now from the
data sheet I'll add profit onto the
values and
segment onto the
legend if I expand this you can see
government segment made the highest
amount of profit with
65.4% let me resize this and we'll add a
border okay in the final visualization
I'll show you how to create a tree map
this tree map will tell you the total
amount of sales made by each product so
under visualizations I'll click on the
tree map let me expand it I'll drag
sales onto values and product onto group
so here you can see our tree map and the
sales made by each product you can see
now we have our report ready we have
created two separate canvas to visualize
our data now if you want to change the
color of These Bars you can simply go to
the format Tab and under data colors you
can choose whichever color you want in
pobi desktop you have an option to
switch your theme this will make your
dashboard or the report look more
attractive so now we are under the
default mode Let's try out different
themes that's Frontier it's temperature
solar which is a little yellowish the
one which I like is tidle I hope this
was helpful in making you understand the
basics of powerbi and how it works you
learned the various features and the
components of powerbi and looked at the
architecture of RBI finally you saw a
demo to create a report using Finance
data set now let's get started by how to
install powerbi in Windows operating
system to install powerbi go to Google
and search for powerbi desktop download
now click on the first link and then you
will be redirected to the official web
page of Microsoft powerbi here you have
to scroll a little towards bottom and
select your language which is English
and then click on
download this will give you two options
so based on your processor select one my
system is 64bit so I'll be selecting
this one now download the file will be
558 MB so it might take a little time
now you can see your Microsoft power Pi
is getting downloaded so if we go into
the download section you can clearly see
it so here it is getting downloaded it
might take a little time now the file
has been downloaded just run the file
and you can directly go to next since
the default language is in English and
in case if you want to select the
particular language you can go to the
select language option and select your
particular language you're searching
for it might take a while there you go
so the installation process has been
started now you can click on next and
now you can read all the terms and
decrements and click on
accept you can change the location if
you want but I'll be keeping it as
default again if you want to create a
shortcut you can on desktop
I'll keep it as it is now install it
might take a
while so power has got successfully
installed you can see the desktop icon
there double click on it and you can
start
powerbi so firstly it is open source if
you want to have a licensed version of
it just get the license or buy now
option and for now let's use the open
source version so this is the bar window
and those are the charts and these are
the data connections if you want to get
connected to your data sources you can
also have shortcuts to that now what are
the steps to connect to data so now we
will go directly into powerbi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will do something
practical on the most most popular ones
so let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my power bii and
first I want to show you that how can I
import data directly from a web page and
import the data now it is asking for a
URL in order to import data so what I
have done is I have created a Google
Excel sheet with simple data with rows
and columns
and what I've done is I've have shared
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your tblo paste it
link over here and click okay
now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading okay now it has read one of the
HTML tables so I'll select this one now
you can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is the
null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and apply
click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me Che change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved crl s now I'll go to
my table and I'll
refresh now you can see as I refreshed
my
power query editor I clicked refresh all
and I got my new row which is there in
the live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I have already
prepared a text file
called subcategories do
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data option
and I'm going to select text SL CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product sub categories.
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers Etc right and I
can now directly load this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
relevant to me it's a composite data in
import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using my SQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now now our next task is to import from
CSV let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what in is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
product category so now I have to click
on the option of import data from Excel
and I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I have done is I have created a PDF
called customers my customers data is
lying in a PDF so what I've done is I've
created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set
which I have created in PDF so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF table
so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now
let's take a look at another interesting
data set which we want to import is the
my SQL Server data
set so what I've have done is I've
already installed my SQL server on my
local instance and there's already a
schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc ra so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to
First download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install install the MySQL connector
based on the operating system you have
you click on download and install it
after you have done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the name
click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading
them okay so now this is the exact data
which is there in the employee and
Department in my S okay so this is one
example of how to create connectivity
between powerbi and
MySQL now I want to do the same thing
using SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so
I have also installed Microsoft SQL
server on my machine and I have used the
SQL Express so this is the name of my
server so which I'll copy the server
name and go to get data select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I have
I have these three tables customers
employe Tre Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which is
now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql uh and this is
from my
SQ
and okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
of what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
within the folder whatever uh data types
of files are there it will Det Ed PDF
Pary or even SharePoint folder which is
itself a
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2
postgress uh sbase Terra dat and then
sap uh uh databases Amazon red shift
Impala
vertica Snowflake and and number of
databases which are there in the market
today Amazon Etc then it also allows you
to connect with its own power platforms
powerbi platforms data Mars powerbi data
flows data ver Etc azour there are
different kind of storage uh mechanisms
in azour and azour itself is a Microsoft
Technology so it has a compatibility
with lot of azour uh based data storages
like azour SQL database blob storage uh
azour data brakes right azour HD Insight
spark so if you have those kind of
services running on your azer cloud
services you can even import them over
here now online services like you know
you have erps running uh or some data
which is shared on the internet if you
want to import it
uh that is also possible through certain
products uh Dynamics 365 Microsoft
Exchange online sales force Google
analytics Adobe analytics GitHub uh
LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other miscellaneous are also
there web based Hive R script python
script if there's something to import
get data from uh Google Sheets like we
saw one example in our video right now
so there are multiple options
available now once you have imported the
data which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you are
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried to once it is imported into
uh powerbi then there is no limitation
of how you use it you can create
visualizations across different data
sets and then create
your standard reports
so this is the example of importing data
from web importing data from a database
from a PDF and then once you have data
you can shape and combine data you can
basically do what whatever
transformation you want to do you want
to uh make joins merge the data so for
example if we go back to our powerbi and
if I go back to my transform data
section now as I have now different data
sets available with me I have have I can
do any kind of U you know operation
transformation on the data right uh so
like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right let for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product sub categories
select product category key on both the
Sid and then they do a left Auto so
whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will
have now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel pagee and
another data set which is text base
see this category subcategory table so
now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization what is
powerbi it is a business intelligence
tool to visualize your data and share
insights across your organization
so when we talk about bi it came into
existence as a self-service bi tool and
it does have different components which
can be used now before we get into
details of powerbi let's understand what
are the different components or what are
the different ways in which you can work
on your powerbi now one of the main
challenges when it comes
to organizations or us users is that
data is scattered in different places it
might be in different formats and anyone
everyone would want to use that data to
basically perform some calculations
create visualizations or dashboards
which could be interactive and that's
where they would want to bring all the
data in one place might be transform it
so that you can filter out and not load
huge amount of data in your system and
you can work on selective data so when
it comes to powerbi it helps us in ETL
it helps us in data modeling it helps in
data storage and Reporting so what are
the benefits of powerbi here are some of
the benefits so extract intelligence
rapidly and accurately so that's
basically transforming your Enterprise
data into Rich visuals and accurate
reports for enhanced decision making now
one thing we already know that when we
talk about data data in draw format
might have lot of hidden information if
we look at different data sets which
I'll show you in the
process it might have lot of meaning but
then the real meaning comes out of the
data if we can create
visualizations if we can create
relationships between different data
sets and does that can help us in
enhanced decision making now powerbi
supports Advanced Data Services it
integrates seamlessly with Advanced
cloud services like Cortana to provide
results for the verbal data queries as
well when you talk about seamlessly
integrating with existing applications
that's one more benefit of powerbi so it
adopts analytics and Reporting
capabilities easily to embed interactive
visuals quickly in your applications you
can build Rich personalized dashboards
so it basically provides a unified user
experience with customized dashboard and
reports that meet your exact needs it
also has a way where you can have secure
way of publishing your reports so you
can set up automatic data refresh and
rapidly publish reports allowing
multiple users to Avail the latest
information across your organization or
across your working
community so powerbi can connect to
different sources we'll see that in a
while so basically you have an option
which says get data and that basically
opens up a window where you can find
different type of data sources such as
Excel your CSV or text Json
PDF getting data from databases or
directly accessing data from databases
now before we get further into
understanding how powerbi looks like it
would be good idea to share information
in how you can set that up on your
machine so when it comes to your powerbi
and let me open up a notepad
here so for example I bring up a notepad
let's say when you talk about your
powerbi
components so you basically have powerbi
desktop and that's mainly your
playground or that's mainly used for any
kind of development
activities you have your powerbi
server or you can say service now this
one is where you would make
Reports
online and
share or make them
[Music]
available two different
buus now that's one more component of
powerbi and then you also have your
power bi mobile which is mainly for
viewing the information or I would say
viewing reports so these are the three
main components we can also look at the
licensing information of these so these
are the mains so powerbi desktop is
something which you can set up on your
laptop or on your machine powerbi server
is where you can log in with your user
ID and password and powerbi mobile is
mainly to view your reports now how do
you set this up before you can explore
or start working on powerbi so here is a
link which you can basically use so if
you look into this so this one basically
says Service Sal service sign up for
powerbi it says sign up of powerbi
service as an individual normally when
you would want to use powerbi I you can
use a website called
HTTP and then you have
basically app and let's say I think it's
called app powerbi.com now this is the
place where you can basically log in now
if you see here I have created an
account and if you look at my account it
says auat l. onmicrosoft.com now how do
you get this kind of email because when
you talk about powerbi it will expect
you to have a official ID and it does
not take IDs which are from common
domains such as Google or Yahoo and so
on so this particular link gives you an
idea how you can do that so basically
you have what is powerbi basic
explanation on that it says signing up
for powerbi service so powerbi desktop
it's a totally free download and then
you have mobile apps also a totally free
download and here it says that what kind
of email addresses it supports and if we
look into this you have to either sign
up because that does not accept your
private email IDs or you can go for this
one which says enroll US government
organization and this is where you can
basically sign up for powerbi so it
basically says try free if you go to the
website say powerbi microsoft.com or you
could go into this one which I was
saying
HTTP SL SL app
do your powerbi.com and this is what you
can use or as mentioned you can go to
Power bi.
microsoft.com for example if I open this
in a different tab it takes me to Power
via Microsoft I can say start free I can
click on this it says Drive free but
then when it asks you to sign in this is
where some of us face problem because it
does not take your private email ID now
how do you tackle that what you can do
here is on this page which says learn
about alternate ways to sign up you can
basically open up this link and in this
link it says sign up for powerbi with a
new Microsoft 365 trial account and what
you can do is you can basically
click on this link which takes you to
The Office
365 and what you can do here is you can
search for something which says say 365
E3 and here you have tried for
free so in my case it is translating
okay so here you have an option which
says tried for free click on this one
and then basically go ahead with your
sign up process now once you do that you
can basic basically create an account or
give a email ID so it asks you to give
an email ID to check if you already have
an account and once you do that it will
guide you through the process where you
can create an account like I have done
now once you have done that so for
example we can go into my this page
which I said HTTP SL
slapp powerbi.com
now once you have created an account you
would be asked to login now I can click
and login here and then basically given
my password and once I do that it takes
me to the powerbi server or service now
on the top right it might say that go
for a trial version I have already
selected that and this is a Pro trial
which is giving me validity for 60 days
so this is the service which I can use
now what it means is I can be using my
powerbi desktop which would be also
installed so once you log into this page
you can basically click on apps you can
basically search for something like
powerbi and that will show up an app and
you can install and download on your
machine now once that is there you can
basically bring it up so for example in
my case I can just say power bi desktop
and that's the app which I have
installed on my machine and basically
that comes up so that's your powerbi
desktop which is coming up and it will
still ask you to sign in so that you can
share your information through powerbi
so you see here on the top I'm already
signed in and here it also shows you
some tutorials and videos which
basically helps you in getting to know
something more or what's new so you can
always browse that so you would have
your powerbi desktop which would be set
up you would also have your powerbi
service which would be running and then
basically whatever you have developed on
your powerbi desktop you can share that
through the powerbi service now usually
when you talk about licensing I can give
you brief insights here so you basically
have
Your powerbi Service as I said licensing
so you have the pro version which is
basically uh your
$9.9 per user per month and basically it
has some kind of limitations so it has
say Max 10 gab you can work on uh some
features like incremental refresh is not
allowed you can always look onto the
Microsoft website for more details and
in those kind of cases you usually go
for the premium account if you are a
extensive user and premium account
basically is conditional based so it
depends on your requirements and then
basically you pay for the service what
you use so that's mainly about your
servicing now when you talk about your
server and Service as I said it is
basically making your reports online and
sharing and making them a available to
different buus so that is the Highlight
so when you talk about sharing reports
that's one of the things you have
anomaly
detection that's also possible here you
can talk about automation of reports you
have security that is you can go for
role based or roow level based kind of
security implementation all those are
some of the features of your powerbi
server and service so it is good to know
and basically have your desktop and
powerbi Service setup now once you have
that then you basically have your
powerbi now when you talk about your
powerbi it basically helps you with
various things so this is how easily you
can have it set up and then basically
you can explore this so for example as I
was saying powerbi can connect to
different data sources now I do have an
option here which says get data I can
click on this and that shows me all the
different data sources I can even click
on more if I'm interested in looking
what more powerbi desktop tool helps me
to do so it shows me all the different
ways in which you can get the data you
see here the servers so the database
Services your folders your different
formats you can click on file formats or
database
you can look at Power Platform so if
basically you are connecting to a
platform and getting some Services you
can connect to the cloud that is aure
you have online services and then you
have other options so these are all the
ways in which you can get your data when
you talk about visualizations you see a
lot of visualization options here which
can be used once your data is loaded and
I will explore and explain more about
this so you have something called as
insert wherein you can go in for
different visuals or different types you
can also get into say transform the data
now that basically is going to pop up
and bring a power query editor now
that's where a lot of your ETL Works
happen so when you when you do a
transform data it opens a power query
editor which we can use to transform the
data or change the data or modify the
data as per our requirement before
loading all of it into our powerbi so
you also have option here which says
modeling wherein we can create new
tables or we can work on our data where
we can manage relationships so as of now
we don't have any data so it does not
show this one as activated but that can
be activated this is where you can view
your reports so this is in short
exploring your powerbi we'll see what
are the different options which we can
use here so it basically supports
different kind of data so when we look
at the visualization pane that basically
allows us to create different kind of
visualizations here and we will
understand that so you can basically
visualize on your different data and
create different kind of charts graphs
maps and basically derive insights from
your data now when you talk about data
models that's where you can basically
establish relationship so when you talk
about data models it is basically used
to connect multiple data sources to
build a relationship now we might have
different data sets or we might have
data coming in from different tables
where we may want to
basically get insights or get data from
multi multiple data
sources for our purpose now in that case
data models do help us so for example if
you have two tables let's look at the
standard tables so you have products
lookup table and you also have the sales
table now usually what you have in any
kind of scenario is if we basically say
you have your data tables so that's
basically where your data resides and
then you you have series of your lookup
tables so usually you might have say
your data tables here and this is what
I'm talking about which might have some
data for example let's say sales is one
of them you might have some other data
table which might be for example let's
say budget table or might be something
else and these are your data tables now
at the the other end you might have your
lookup tables so basically you have
various lookup
tables and these lookup tables for
example let's say this one is
customer this one is
territory let's say this is
product and let's say this one is a
calendar so these are basically my my
lookup
tables so we can basically as I said
your data might be coming in from
different sources let's say database or
let's say some kind of files or let's
say some kind of systems what you have
so your data might be coming in from
different places now you might want to
transform the data so this is where I
could say there is your query editor
which I was explaining so you have your
query editor which basic basically
allows you to edit the data table or
basically allows you to edit the data
before it is loaded right you can hide a
column you can add a new column you can
modify your column so your query editors
would be basically used to work on the
data which goes into your data tables
now you might have lot of lookup tables
as I said so let's say these are my
lookup tables and and these are my data
tables so what we need is sometimes we
need information based on our lookup
tables and data tables now that's where
data modeling comes into picture so
basically if I would want to extract
information from here so I can notice
that there is a product key here and
there is a product key here now this is
where we are already talking about say
foreign keys or we are talking about
your relationships right now when you
talk about relational databases you have
something called as foreign key
constraints which is in in powerbi terms
I would say it's not exactly a
constraint but it is more of a filter
propagation instead which is used to
basically connect your different data
sources and you could have basically
crossfilter directions you can go for
single or one to one or one one to many
or many to many kind of relationships
which basically allows you to work on
the data so we will learn more about
data models when we are doing a quick
demo there where we can talk a little
bit about normalization and
denormalization the way the data exists
right and then you basically would want
to gather insights from your data so
when you talk about your two data
sources as I said so you have a products
lookup table you you have a sales table
now if you would want to calculate the
total order quantity of each product
name which is we are talking about the
order quantity as a information here and
you have product name here now how do
you get that information what we see
here is we would want something like
this or we would want more information
so how do we do that so what we can do
is the order quantity for each product
is is basically showing us the same
value now this is because the product
and sales tables are not connected and
there is no relationship between them
even if you would want to take two
sources and just get information out of
them powerbi would complain that there
is no relationship established between
them so what we do is we create a data
model so what we do is we build a
relationship between both the tables
using a common key column which exists
in both both cases as I said there is a
product key here there is a product key
here so that basically allows us to have
a relationship between these two now
that could be one to one this could also
be related to other tables so it could
be one to many you could have many to
one so all those relationships are
possible so product key is basically
used to create a relationship you see
the arrow Mark and then there is also
this star which can basically mean one
to many now when the product key is used
to join these two tables or form a
relationship then we can look at the
product names and the order quantities
which basically gives me a total now
that's the basic use of your data models
now what about this Dax so basically
data analysis Expressions now that's say
library of functions and operators that
can be combined to build formulas and
expressions and powerbi desktop usually
when we work on our data sources when we
would want to connect them it
automatically shows us these data
analysis Expressions however this gives
us extension it basically gives us more
power to work on our data now sometimes
instead of working on Dax or Dax
Expressions it would be good to go for
better data modeling and have the
relationships established better and
sometimes when the relationships are are
established you could use your tax which
basically gives you more power on
working on your data so your values are
calculated based on information from
each row of a table it appends values to
each row in a table and stores them in
the model it increases the file size so
that's what happens now you can right
click on any column to add a new column
and for example in this one it shows
that there was a quantity type
calculated column which was based on the
calculation what we see here on the top
in the in the expression bar which says
what kind of calculation was performed
and that basically gives us the value
for quantity type and that is basically
added here to our existing data so
that's the power of Dax and powerbi so
you also have something called as uh
measures so Dax allows you to create new
calculated columns and measures so
basically here if you see we are working
on
awor sales and then we have selected
quantity sold and what we are looking in
the report is we can basically right
click on any table name to add a new
measure here so we have added what we
call as quantity sold as the measure so
values are calculated based on
information from any filters in the
report Port we will see this how this
can be done and that basically here the
measure does not increase the file size
it does not create new data in the table
themselves in comparison to what we were
seeing earlier that is your calculated
columns so these are your type of Dax
functions so Dax allows you to create
new calculated columns and measures so
you have date and time which basically
allows you to work on date and time data
or Fields you you have logical functions
which allow us to create new filters or
add more filters to our data you have
text functions which basically allows us
to say transform the data into a lower
case or an upper case or basically get
the length of a string or concatenate
two fields or basically uh do a
filtering based on some criterias or
replacing some content you also have
statistical functions which can be used
you have information
functions which can be used so these are
different types of Dax functions which
we can use in powerbi so we will learn
more on powerbi through a quick demo
where we can U use some data sets and
those data sets could be found on
internet although I can also upload that
on a GitHub link and you will have
access to those data sets so let's learn
about powerbi through a quick demo
by uploading some data sets and playing
with those data sets let's look at a
sample data set and let's upload it and
as I explained while uploading let's
also transform the data so that we can
have selective fields or selected data
loaded here instead of loading the
complete data set and then let's see how
we can visualize this or how we can use
the information in this data set set now
what we can do here is we can click on
get data and then we can choose one of
the data formats which we would be
looking for so for example I can go for
Excel and basically click on this now
here are some of my data sets so let's
look into the folder here and these data
sets are also available on my GitHub
link which I'll share with you later
so here we have something called a super
store let's click on this and here I
already have a data set which is global
super store or I also have selective
data so let's select this one click on
open now that's basically connecting to
my data source and that will show me
what does that Excel sheet have so it
has different tabs which is orders
people and returns so let's let's select
orders and that basically gives me a
preview of the data which I have and if
you scroll all the way to right it shows
me city state and then country and if
you see here we do see information of
all the countries now this can be huge
amount of data which may which we would
want look into but say for example my
use case is that I'm interested in
looking for the data for United States
and uh as a country and all its states
so we will do that when we do a
transform now we can also select the
returns Tab and that shows me these
three Fields however the first row
should have been the heading of this uh
particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on transform
data now once you do that it brings you
your toolkit that's brings you your
power query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or returns
data source as you see here so we see
column 1 column two and column three and
that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
also do a merge query or a pend query so
as of now let's just say use first row
as headers and that basically shows that
now my first row has become the header
you also see in the applied steps it
basically tells me if I have changed the
type of the data if I have made any
other changes those steps will get added
here so it basically shows me the name
as it returns it shows me applied steps
where I've changed the type and now I
basically have this information now this
is something where you can change the
type or you can basically set it to a
particular form at however we are not
doing anything of that sort right now so
we can do that for any of these columns
so this looks good when it comes to
orders let's click on this and as I said
I would be interested in selecting for
country as United States only and let me
just work on that data however we can
work on all the data so let me scroll
all the way to right and here I have the
country now there are these filters
which we can use so basically I can
click on this and that shows me all the
countries are selected now there is also
something called as text filters which
we will see how we can use to select
particular data I basically have other
ways of filtering the data so for
example now I will just uncheck the
select all and what I would be
interested is in United States so let's
type it here that shows me as an option
here select this and then basically say
okay so that should basically now filter
out and it shows me the data is United
States only and then you have different
states and rest of the data remains so
if you look at the applied steps it
tells me that there are filtered rows
now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set on
these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
which says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the
changes which I have performed using my
query editor that is I have transformed
the data so that I can have selective
data uploaded in my powerbi now it's
doing that it shows me it is working on
both of these data sources that is
orders and returns so that's done and
now basically if there are any other
pending changes we can just do a close
and apply so that basically has closed
and now you would see the data appearing
here so I have uploaded the data as per
my preferences now if you click on the
data tab here so it basically shows you
your data fields it might take some time
to populate but if you see in the
country field now if even if I click on
the filter it just shows me United
States now that's what we wanted so we
have already uploaded this data in
orders you can always expand the option
here which shows me all the fields which
are there in this might be this is an
aggregation might be that's an order
date so this is again some kind of
aggregation we can change the data types
so we are looking at all the fields in
my orders table or basically coming from
the orders data source I also have
returns which shows me three fields and
that shows me the data which is returned
order ID and region so the column names
are applied correctly as we want and
that basically looks fine now we can
also look at
your model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which relates to orders
and returns then that would fail because
it would say there is no relationship
now I can go to the first option which
says report and we have not created any
report here although we can create a
simple report we can look at the data so
we have our orders field now we can
basically pull out some information from
here we can choose what kind of report
we may want to create so for example
let's go for uh the table option from
visualizations you have various options
here which we can use this is where you
can do a formatting this is where you
can select the fields this this is where
you can search and filter out the data
you can also add data fields here so
first let's click on table and that
basically gives me a table now this
table as of now does not have anything
so you can use the filter and
slices option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have orders here so
this is my orders and I would like to
work on this so let's say for example
country is I can select country as a
field and if you say it shows me country
is all as of now and it says the value
is United States what I can also do is
I'm interested in the states so I have
state now I can basically drag and drop
it here and then the state gets added
here so I can basically say select all
and that should basically take care of
my State field being added here so state
is all country is all now we can
basically look at something else so
might be let's choose sales and I can
just drag and drop sales here so that
basically says if you would want to have
any kind of advanced filtering which
says filter type so go for advanced
filtering is less than or equal or you
can also Al go for advanced filters so
that's fine as of now so we have added
some Fields here and that's
basically my data here so let's go for
filters
here which basically should select all
my
Fields now if you see the visualization
shows my country sales and state which
we had either by selecting the feed
fields and dropping them here or you can
in this section where it says Fields so
you can for example let me show it again
so I can just delete this I can click on
the table option I can just drag it here
I can basically make it bigger and I
need to add data to this one so it says
add data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested in
States so let's drop that here and let's
say sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is a
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can B basically increase the
font here we can change the grid color
so for example let's make it for example
blue so I can just select
this and it should basically allow me to
have the grid color as blue now I can go
in for the grid thickness I can go for
rope padding outline color so we can
basically make it a little bit more
readable and then then we can basically
increase the font size here to look at
the
information and you have other options
here so what would you want to do with
column headers so I can basically have
the font color background color is fine
do you want to have an outline do you
want to have a change in font what is
the text size might be we can make the
heading a little bigger and then
basically you also have the field
formatting so all those could be done
you could go for background and all
these things can be done in formatting
so now we already have our data here and
this basically looks good and this is
basically one of my visuals which I have
here and this has given me some
information for sales and basically I
can scroll this I can also make it
bigger so I could select a particular
field if I'm more interested in looking
at the information for a particular
State now I can add more fields to this
so this is my one of the reports which I
have created now what I can do with this
report is I can basically have more data
fields I can add filters to this I can
basically look into all the data here by
just clicking somewhere in the grid but
somewhere outside if you select a
particular row then that data shows up
here you have an option of focus mode
which you can go for you can look at the
other options which says export data now
if this is the data which you are
interested in you can export it you can
always do show as a table if you are
interested in you can do a sort by
country sales or state so for example
let's do a is sorting by
state and that basically gives me the
data which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me
alphabetically this is the information
which I have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a powerbi file which has an
extension of PB iix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say
state wise sales in
USA let's say USA and that basically is
my first
report
now once you have saved this report you
can always look on your machine for
example if I go in here and if I go into
this folder might be I should look on
desktop and this is where I should have
saved it so it shows me first report
statewise that will open up in powerbi
and we have created a simple report
which which we have basically used by
taking our data now I can also do is I
can publish this if I would want to
share this information so publish this
report online in powerbi service you can
basically
select your report what we have here and
I clicked on publish so it says what's
the destination so you can have
different workspaces I will choose the
default that's my workspace I can click
on select now it says publishing first
report statewise sales in USA to powerbi
you can create a portrait view of your
report and you can do all that stuff so
let it publish and then we can basically
look into our powerbi server that's our
service where the information is already
shared or published I would say which
can then be shared with different
sources so we can come here here and
basically I can look into the
powerbi and this is where I will be able
to look into my workspaces and let's
look in my workspace so it says this is
the place where I had initially
downloaded powerbi data set it says your
data set is ready let powerbi help you
explore your data right so you can
always do this you can click on view
data set which basically allows you to
bring out your workspace and first
report state wise sales now that's the
report which we have published so let's
first check in our desktop if that's
done so it
says success open first report in
powerbi now I can click on this one
straight away and that takes me to my
service now once it takes me to the
service it shows me the report which we
created which we published and it
basically has the option where I can
save it
as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in diff
in a website or a portal I can publish
to
web embed this report for Public Access
by anyone on the internet we can do that
we can export it to PowerPoint so we can
do all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are
interested in something specific you can
do a sharing to teams so if you have
your teams or group setup you can share
it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically view
usage metrics report now that can be
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with powerbi Pro will have access
to this report recipients will have the
same access as you unless Ro level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them look at
this
report right you can also allow
recipients to build new content using
the underlying data sets and you can
send an email notification to the users
as of now I don't have any other groups
so I'll not be sharing it but I have
created a simple report now let's also
look at edit report let's just to see
what it helps us and when you click on
edit report it basically brings up this
one which says your file view it gives
you the filters it basically allows you
you to add data fields to this so it is
basically giving access to these data
sets which were in my desktop it is
basically allowing you to give or create
different
visualizations now here we have the data
which we are looking at and if say for
example somebody is interested in
filtering the data so you could do that
so you could click on filter here and
that basically applies this is the
filter we have
now country is fine sales might be I can
click on sales and I would say okay
let's look at sales which is more than a
particular amount so we can say is
greater than and might be I can give a
number here so I can say
30,000 and
basically I can say apply
filter so right now I'm applying filter
and I would look at the values
which also shows me the total value is
changed so you have not only created a
report you have published it and now
from the service you can edit it so I'm
looking at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say
first report
underscore state wise sales and I will
say modified so let's do a
save and the report has been
saved so now you're looking at the data
here so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace
here I can click on reports and that
does show me my previous report it shows
me the modified report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metrics so let's
click on this one and that basically
shows me the report usage metrics which
is generated so views per day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if if we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports and
that basically took me to usage metrix I
could be sharing it I can analyze in
Excel I can look for quick insights
based on this data what we have you can
basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me the
data sets which can be used to create
further reports and we have our data
here so for example if I click on create
report it basically gives me these data
sets and we can continue working on this
so this is how I have a simple report
created without basic basically working
on two different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have and
say you would want to add some Fields so
let's go to returns and say for example
I would be interested in looking at the
the products so might be what I should
do is I should replace the report here
instead of country it would be
interesting to look at the product which
we have or basically customer ID so we
can look at customer ID we can look at
the order ID which would be interesting
to see if there is a particular order
what was the sales which was generated
and if there were any returns which were
happening on that so for example here
when I have these let me cutout country
as a field and I will basically take
order ID and place it here so now if you
see my data has been easily modified so
I have my order ID I have sales and I
have statewise information so you have
basically all the information but this
is now order ID State and so on now what
if I would want to also see based on the
order I
if I say I would want the returned field
so for example I would want to take this
one and let's drag and drop it here now
that says cannot display the visual now
why is that so if you click on C details
that says cannot determine relationships
between the fields so it cannot display
the data because powerbi cannot
determine the relationship between two
or more fields and how do we fix that so
for example if I click on fix this now
it says there is a missing relationship
between these fields use autod detect to
search for relationships or create them
manually now I can click on autod detect
which will try to search for fields
which exist in both the data sets or
basically I can create relationships so
let's click on create relationships and
that basically takes me to this page
which says there are no relationships
defined from table two table and so on
so I can click on
new now here it says select the tables
and the colums that are related now I
can say orders now those are my Fields
where you have order IDs and it
automatically shows that returns also
has an order ID field although all the
values might not be same but this is how
you can create a relationship and it
says the cardinality says many to one so
you can have basically many to one
relationship you're saying cross filter
Direction is single so make this
relationship active and it has already
helped us basically identifying the
field so I can say okay so it says now
these two tables should be related or
should be connected based on order ID
so here we have this and let's basically
say
close now once that is done if you
see I have order ID I have returned I
have sales column and I have state and
if you see in returned I do have a value
of yes which shows this particular order
ID had generated some sales and it was
for state Alabama and it was returned
and the value is yes so if you scroll
down you basically see all the values
now we can add different filters where
we can say I would want only yes and no
now this is again an interesting report
so let's go in also into the
formatting and what we can do is we can
look at say the grid option if we would
want to basically say vertical grid and
let's
say on and it says vertical grid color
so let's select this might be I can try
doing a black here it puts it in a right
nice table format and that basically
looks good so you have sales returned
and so on and this is basically the
order which I'm seeing here so for
example if I would want to change the
order and if I'm saying okay I would
like to look at sales and returned and
so on so we can be doing that we can
come here and say for example I have
sales and returned let's try moving the
sales column over here might be state is
uh an information which we would want in
the beginning so let me also move the
states all the way here so it gives me
state it gives me the order ID sales and
if there was a return which was
happening on that particular product so
easily I've modified my report now now
what I can do is I can just save
it and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and uh now
here we will also see how you can load
some data and perform some
Transformations and basically get
multiple results or multiple tables or
multiple data sets which can be then
further used for reporting so powerbi
does give you a lot of options now here
you have an option as we saw earlier
that is get data or what you can do is
you have an option where you can create
new data also which says enter data now
this is something which can be easily
used if you have relatively less number
of fields so you can basically add more
columns here and you can basically add
values so for example if I would just
call it something
like um scientist
ID okay and then I can say scientist
name and then basically I can say uh
[Music]
domain and then I can say for example
let's say ear of joining and and I can
keep adding the number of columns here I
can delete the columns right and I can
give this and I can say country so
that's it and now we have created these
five countries uh sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID
be
2234 I can give some name so let's give
Peter let's say domain and I can say
biotechnology I can give year of joining
2011 and I can say Germany as the
country and I really don't want this
particular column so I can go ahead and
delete this now I can come here and then
I can give something else so I can say
this is scientist ID I can give John
let's say the scientist is mainly
working in
physics and then I can say
2018 and let's say
France and go back here and let's
say
4567 and let's say Marie and let's say
uh she does her research in uh molecules
and let's call it 20
2001 and let's say
Italy okay and you can continue adding
data in this way now you can say if the
data is already here so I can say for
example no I do not want this particular
row I do not want this particular row so
you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so
here we have to give some Nam so let's
say
scientists okay and then if you choose
edit it basically brings up your powerbi
editor which allows you to work on these
fields if you would want to make some
changes now we can make some changes
here we can see what are the number of
rows we can basically perform any kind
of transactions here so this one
basically tells me what is the data type
so here we see scientist ID and this
clearly tells me this is an integer
however we will not want to do any kind
of computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work on this particular
column what I can also do is I can just
click on this and this tells me that you
would want to change it to date time or
you want to change it to some number so
I can just say string because we are not
going to perform any computation here so
on the ID column so let's say text and
I'm changing it so it says replace
current add a new Step so selected
column has an existing type conversion
would you like to replace the existing
conversion or preserve the existing so I
will say replace current and now the
data type has been changed it is of a
string and if you see this step has got
added here so it says that the change
type is the kind of transformation we
did here so that's fine now what we can
also do is we have the scientist name
but we don't like the column name here
so it would be good to change this so
there is something called as remove or
remove columns and so on so when you do
a right click it gives you a lot of
options in applying filters or doing
some transformation if if I just click
on this one so what I can do is I can
look at the date time and let's go here
so we have an option which says do you
want to change the type now we could
have done that here or like I said you
could choose the time and do it you can
just say transform and how do you want
to change it so do you want to change it
to uppercase well you can do that and
changes all the values of this one
what I can do is I can again do a right
click and I can choose basically if you
would want to clean up the data or if
you would want to convert to lower case
you want to capitalize each word so
let's choose that and if you see here
the steps are getting added now to undo
any particular step if I just cancel
this then I'm back to this if I cancel
this I'm back to my original form so you
can anytime undo your changes and you
can basically work on this so we are
working on this particular column now
there are various other options that you
can look at so for example these are
this is some of my data but it does not
have much information it would be good
to load some bigger data set and then
use these
Transformations or basically working on
changing the data types as I mentioned
or if you would want to do a filtering
and remove certain fields and only
select particular Fields if that's what
you're interested doing a right click
where I want to create a copy of this
and then basically I can use that
particular copy now what I can also do
is I can add column from examples I can
duplicate column and then I can make
some changes to that so this is my
duplicate column and say for example you
would want
um this one to be changed so we can say
remove duplicates we can basically if
you're doing some kind of change you
want to change the format here you can
do that you can use for other things
like filling up and all that now I can
just call it rename and let's say um
Alias scientist name right and I can
continue adding columns or I can do some
Transformations and once you have done
with these transactions now this one if
you see it shows as integer but is it an
integer no this is an date format so I
can go for modeling and change the
formats what I can also do is I can
select this and it says it's not a
decimal it's not a fixed decimal it is
date time it is date it is date time and
time
zone right and you can select any one of
these so for example let's make it date
which
makes it more meaningful but then what
happens is when you do this it is going
for the default dates or the older dates
so I don't like that so what we will
have to do is we will have to basically
transform this and here we have
transform you have change type so you
have date and time you have date you
have time so let's choose date and time
and if you see here it gives me some
default timing based based on these
values which we do not like so again
filter it out but what we can do is we
can just make sure that this is changed
or you want to make it a string because
we are not going to do any computation
here so I can keep it as date but then
if I have more Fields like month and
days and so on then you can do that so
here it also has the options so when you
have selected this you have an option
called transform and transpose uh sorry
transform also has various options which
allow you to work on these do you want
to do some scientific calculations do
you want to work on the date field so as
of now it is just integer so we can use
one of these we can do a group by but
obviously we don't have much data here
so as of now let us retain this I can
just change this to text and that's okay
because we are going to look at this
later we can add more data and work on
it so as of now once we have done all
these changes you can go back to say
home and here you have close and apply
and I can basically say close and apply
so the changes will be applied and then
my new table which we just created by
entering some random data performing
some basic
Transformations will be available so if
you look into this
one so that's where my data is it shows
me the columns but there is no
aggregated column as such here you don't
see any summation Mark you just see the
field names or the column names you see
the values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no or there is no
existence of a different table which you
can join these tables or you can perform
some transactions come back to the data
set so this looks good and we have it
here now obviously we have not created
any visualization based on this which we
can and we can continue working on it so
here this is my data set which is a
small table where we have created some
data and we can use it anytime now let's
work on a bigger data set and see what
kind of Transformations we can do we can
then also see on modeling or basically
using some smarter ways of working with
the
data so what we would want to do is we
would want to load some data here so
let's go
[Music]
into sorry let's go into home let's go
to get data let's use our old store data
and I'm going to take the global super
store which is huge data set with all
the countries and the products and the
sales which have happened and we can
take this data but before loading it as
I suggested earlier we should basically
transform the data we should basically
transform the data so that you don't end
up loading everything and you don't work
on all the data I mean unless you really
want to so here I will this Excel sheet
which I'm talking about has two
different tabs we have used it before so
let's use orders let's use returns and
that basically shows me the data what we
have so I can do a load but that's not
what we would want to do so you can do a
load and you can get all the data but
let's go to
transform make some basic
Transformations before we load the data
so our power bi editor allows us to work
on this now here we
have it says this preview may be up to 9
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because because
that's what I want so it is basically
setting the first row as header which
looks good and we have some order IDs we
have
the returned If the product was returned
so let's look at the filter here so it
just has yes values which we are looking
at
so it says list may be incomplete let's
say load
more and let's see what what are the
filters here so either there might be a
product which is returned or it might be
blank field so that is chosen so that's
fine we have order ID we have region
which is basically showing me different
regions here let's look at orders and
orders is again having your row ID order
ID order date ship date ship mode so you
have quite large amount of data here for
your different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now I
can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now
here we have this row ID and if you see
the row ID is an integer obviously we
will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here you don't have
any row ID but here we have row ID so
let's make it uh from integer let's make
it string and I'll say replace current
so that's that looks fine it's say row
ID which we will use to search but we
are not going to perform any
computations unless you want to find on
an average on row ID or anything else
now you have order IDs so what we can do
is we can f filter some
values we can rename the field as we
desired right so for example let's go in
here and what we can do is let's go
into uh customer ID
ship okay and here you have say State
you have
region okay now at any point of time if
I would want to filter out the values
the easier option is that you can select
on this one and here you can do some
text filtering okay or you can basically
select the values from here so for
example if I say let's get rid of select
all what we will be interested in uh say
United States and UK that's the data we
want and then I can basically say okay
so it is basically going to filter out
the data which is for United States and
UK as of now now what we can also do is
how about doing some more filtering
before we basically work on this so
let's go in here and we are looking at
United States and UK related data and
let's look at it is sometimes good that
you can
basically uh work on the data here so
for example I go into orders now what I
would want to do is I would want want to
look
at the fields okay and we want to we
have not yet loaded the data so if you
look in the background I just have my
scientist because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields can be used for grouping the data
so we will see that whenever you have a
data set you would already know there
are certain fields which have repeated
values which can be used to group the
data and we can do that we can change
any kind of values which are not going
to be computed on so for example I have
postal code I can use this but again we
are not going to find a postal code
which is greater than something right so
integer is not the valid type let's
change it to text
okay and uh if for example I would want
to look at this so I have done some
changes here okay and this shows me null
so for example let me just rever this
back and let's make
it a whole
number okay so there are certain columns
or rows which do not have some values
and we can basically get rid of those
values so as of now we can do a
filtering here so let's keep the postal
code AS integer or let's change it to
text do a replace content and now what
we will do is we'll scroll all the way
right might be I'm interested in
technology category so that's what I'm
interested in so what I can do is here I
can do some
filtering so I can basically
choose technology now the easier way
would be since these are categories and
there are only three categories we
really don't want to go and apply text
filters here but if you had something
like an office supply and um Office
Inventory then you could have done some
text filter so let's not do some text
filtering here what we can do is I would
be interested in technology so that's
the field I'm interested in so now you
are only having data which is related to
technology okay and you have some
product names so this is where we want
to do some kind of filtering so we can
rename the field we can select some
Fields so let's for example let's go
for uh any of the field which I think
might have more entries here so for
example let's go
for Canon Wireless or Canon Image right
so let's go for product names and I will
say
let's go
here now I could have done a
transformation but that's not what we
want we want to do some filtering so
let's go to text filter and here I can
say begins with I can say ends with I
can say contains so let's go for
contains and it says enter a value here
so you would want to keep the rows where
the product name contains something and
it gives you some
suggestion right so where you are seeing
in some values here so for example if I
would have selected this then it applies
the complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Canon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and what do they
contain what kind of values you're
looking for so you can do that but we
will not go for advanced in one step
let's go for basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data when you look at the
country we are still focusing on United
States and United Kingdom that kind of
data right so we have filtered the data
we have done some uh selection based on
the data here and what I can do is I can
then basically rename a particular field
so I can do that I can say I'm
interested in um sales which is the data
here we can basically look into the
quantity so sales is something which we
are interested in but might be we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I'm interested in sales or I'm looking
at if the discount percentage was
something or if the profit was more
right so we can apply different kind of
values here but what we can do is with
these changes because you don't want to
transform and make changes all here you
want to make the changes once the data
set is uploaded so we have selected some
data we have create done some
Transformations we can basically break a
particular column into multiple columns
if that's what we want if we see that we
will do an aggregation based on ear or
we will do a aggregation based on the
country or year and Order ID right so we
can break this data into multiple
columns so we can do that but for now
let's do a close and apply and let's
apply this so that's going to apply all
these changes it's going to load my data
but remember now we are having selective
or selected data which gets loaded so
that should get be available here so it
takes time sometimes so you have to wait
and then you can go ahead and check here
so for example now I'm looking in tables
let's basically minimize this let's go
for orders and this is the data I have
which obviously row ID if you see so you
have all the row IDs and again again you
can do filtering here but this is where
you have already loaded the data the
data is available and then you can start
working on the columns here so we have
this if you closely see we see this
summation Mark and this basically means
that these are my aggregated columns or
these values are measures which can be
used for calculations so we can see that
we can create our own aggregations so we
can do that we can rename the field as
we have
seen we can filter out the data so we
have all the fields showing up from
orders and let's also look at the
returns which basically has the columns
the order ID and your region so it
basically shows the region here where
was the product returned from and we
have this information
so what we are doing is we when we were
doing a text filter in the previous
example remember it was case sensitive
okay and you have to take care of when
you're doing a text filter you have to
give a field which exactly matches as it
exists in the content now okay this is
the data we have and let's look at the
order column right now what we can do is
we can do some quick Transformations
here and we can basically look for more
data here so let's say we have uh some
filtering to be done now I can do a
filtering based on
my uh product so we had all these
products but now let's do a filtering on
product and then products you have
copers you have machines so you have
mainly two categories right and when you
look at machines it basically talks
about your
PC uh something so let's look for
machines and here we have basically The
copier fields which are more so I can
basically go for filtering
here and that's the data we have so we
don't want to really unselect any of
these here but what I'm doing is I'm
saying text filter and let's go into
this one now and let's say
contains okay so I'm saying contains and
then I can basically say uh let's say
copier now that's what I'm interested in
and uh show rows where product name
contains
copier okay now you can give a and
condition here so if you would want a
specific copier if you are interested in
okay let's also say uh contains and
let's go for laser
also laser and let's say okay so you see
the data gets filtered out here and uh
we have the sales which we are seeing
here so let's go to sales and we will be
interested in anything above 500 so
let's go to
sales let's go for number filters let's
say greater than and I will say for
example 500 oh sorry
500 okay
and uh let's say okay so that basically
filters out the data and then I am also
interested in quantity Where I would
want the quantity to
be more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go
in here and you can basically choose
what is the filter you want so you can
apply any number of filters now you have
the filtering here you can always click
on the filter and if you want you can
just do a clear filter and the filtering
will be gone so you have all the data
right and this is the particular data we
have and here I have say for
example product name now I can keep the
filter because I'm interested only in
these values or I can filter out so this
tells me that when we did a and it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filter say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or so last time we did a and
and I'll do a contains
laser so let's choose this that gives me
more entries so either the product name
has copier or it has laser it has the
quantity it has the product name and we
have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as uh looks like
the country name uh the year and then
the order ID so we can basically split
it up so I can select this and here I
have option
of let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select
this if I just do a right click here now
here it just tells me do you want a new
column do you want to create a copy of
this column okay you want to create copy
table so this is your transformed data
what you have and for example let's
create a copy
table and let's come in here
so you should be able to see
your copy table now so let's go
in and select this
one and what you need to do here is
creating a copy of this or copy table
would not be the right option what we
can do is we can work on transforming
this rather than doing it from here so
you have this option of adding a new
column going for a new measure renaming
it right so that's okay but what we can
do is Select this particular column
let's do a home and first thing is let's
go to transform so I want to transform
the data now let's select this one and
it brings up your power editor again
here we were interested in orders so we
are looking at our data
here now if you see my country is United
States and UK so you can confirm that if
you look at category it is technology
product name has copier and Laser as we
selected so those things are retained so
you have not lost any changes as of now
so this order ID column what we have now
as I said you can be doing a filtering
okay you can select this particular
column and then you have other things
which can be used to transform here like
you want to change the data type you
want to use first row as header you want
to replace some values okay you want to
run some merge queries you want to do
some analytics so all these options are
here now what we can do is while this
column is selected I can do a right
click now there is an option called
transform which is basically going to
help me in changing the data here okay
now I can basically duplicate the column
so I really don't want to work on this
Colum column itself but it would be good
to have a duplicate column on which we
can work on so I can do a split column
here if I would want to but let's create
a duplicate column so let's say
duplicate
column now that gives me a duplicate
column so we can rename it later so now
I will not work on my original column
but I'll work on a duplicate column and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
basically transform form or split this
so again do a right click now you have a
split by so we can say split by by D
limiter or by number or by characters or
by positions so by lower case and upper
case so you can do all of this so let's
go for by D limiter now if you see it
basically identifies the D limiter which
is hyphen or Dash now you can go for
split at leftmost identify right sorry
left leftmost D limiter rightmost each
occurrence of D limiter and that's what
we want to do you can look into advanc
options where it says split into columns
so do you want to split that into
columns do you want to split that into
rows because that's more or less like
doing a group by and you can say number
of columns to split into so we have here
1 2 3 4 values so that looks good to me
and uh let's do say for example if I
choose three
so I can choose three and then split
using special characters so you could do
that so let's for example let's say
okay and let's look at the data how it
looks like we can anytime delete the
data we can keep it the way we want
right so what we did was we created a
copy of the column then we did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a three as
the resulting column so I have the order
ID okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID here and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says Tec M A I'm looking at the
first one
370 and that has in no relation to the
order ID right so we can make sure that
there is nothing which is conflicting
with our entries now once that is done
so we have order ID which can be used to
categorize the data you have order ID
which is basically the year okay and you
have order ID which is basically having
some more value now I can keep this data
as I want so I can basically click on
this I can go for renaming and I can say
let's say let's call it
order
ID and let's
says IDs so let us in case there is a
particular column and you would want to
look at so just give the name correctly
now order IDs is f so here we will also
rename this one so let's call it uh
order
year and that's going to be order here
so we can again change this to string
okay and here you have the order ID so
let's rename this
one and I have
my let's call
order
number right so we have we are seeing
all the steps which we have added here
we just split the data based on the D
limiter and we have now three new
columns which have got added to our
existing data which was already filtered
and we have done some splitting up of
data by creating a duplicate and then
renaming it right so if
you go and look at your Transformations
now if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID with a
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on year
right now we have the year field or
order date field here you have the ship
date right but then might be you want to
just aggregate based on year you don't
want to really spend time in aggregating
or extracting the month and day and so
on so my these three columns can be
useful now what I can also o do is I can
merge The Columns if I want so we have
split the columns but what I can do is I
can say select select select so using
your control and now do a right click so
you should have an option called merge
columns right now this is something
which is uh we would want to merge so
let's say merge columns and let's say do
you want to keep a separator so yes I
want to keep a separator but might be
this time I will give my separator is
a uh colon and then what is the merge
column name you want to create so let's
call it something
like
um
order okay uh here and then let's call
it num right so sometimes renaming the
fields to a name which makes more sense
or based on your naming convention is
good so let's do a merge and now what I
have done is I have done merging of
those columns so I split the data I merg
The Columns and now if you see my The
Columns which I had created those
columns are gone because you did a merge
you did a merge and now you have the
fields which are either
uh earlier you had something which is
separated by a hyphen and here you have
something which is separated by colon
right now anytime if you want you
can unmerge this by removing this step
right and you can get rid of this merge
column so if for example I would do that
so I have my data back
right I have my data back so what we
could have done is we can select
this okay and then what we can do is
like what we did earlier so you
can basically go for removing the
columns okay you can do a merge column
okay you can select one by one and
create duplicate of those and then you
can merge them right so all the possible
options are there so you can the best
option would be to create a duplicate of
these columns and then basically merge
them as per your convenience so might be
you can say order IDs and order number
is the pairing what you want ear is
something which you don't want right
because we already have the date field
so I can basically say
remove and this one is gone now I will
select this and this
and let's go for merge columns and I
want to give a separator which
is might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a symbol and then
what do you want to call it so let's say
order
specs
okay right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the year into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order
specs right now this is some simple
Transformations what we are doing here
we are seeing the data which we have
okay now what I can do is I can
basically first apply these
changes so that all my changes what I
have done are applied right now once
these changes are done we can basically
go ahead and save this file so I can
just say save I can go for save as I
have different other options so if you
would want to perform keep performing
your transformation then you can just do
this you can add a column you can view
the data so for now our Transformations
are good enough
and what we can do is we can
basically go back to home we can do a
close and apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been
transformed so we have ordered specs
here that's good we did not do any
filtering or um we have the filter left
here which basically tells me that there
are these different fields we have not
removed them but what we are doing is we
are just applying a filter to choose
copiers and Laser
Printers so that's what we have here and
this is good enough now what I can do is
once this is done I can basically save
it so I would want to call it some kind
of report if you would want to create
okay so let's call
it as uh uh let's say
second
report and here I will say
country and
Technology specific
info let's save it
and now basically I have saved my data
so what you can do is you can go
for creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that's what you want to do if you want
to go for visualization because right
now what we are seeing is we have lot of
data here we have lot of data here it
shows me there are these uh tables or
data sets which we have worked on that
shows
me here in the models but there is no
relationship with them if you go into
visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here now based on the data what
we transformed if you see we have order
specs right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
Shi date you have aggregated columns
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this and for that
what I can do is let's go for ship mode
now this is something what we have so we
are in this data field field now we have
this transform so let's go back to
transform
again and let's choose our orders so
that's the data we have and now if you
see here this
is you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode so here you have a
option called Group by so I can select
this I can go in here I can basically
work on okay get rid of duplicate values
but that's not what we want to do you
want to do a group buy so as I said you
can do a group buy from here or you can
choose from the transform option above
and you can do a group buy so let's do a
group buy now how do you want to group
the data so I'm saying I want to group
the data here based on shipping
mode or which is the other column you
want to use to do a group buy so let's
go for shipping mode and what is the new
column name right so we want to
basically find out that you want to go
for ship mode but that's not enough I
mean I can do a ship mode and I can do a
grouping buy but you want to just count
the rows no that's not what we want to
do so let's go to Advanced so ship mode
is fine so that's your grouping right
but then what we also want to do is we
want to do a grouping based
on say sales so here for example let's
go for
sales okay and what should we call this
so might be we can say uh
shipment wise sales whatever you would
want to call so you can basically get
the operation do you want to really
count the rows no we want to basically
do a summing or we want to we find out
an average price right so let's do a
sum okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on say for example sales
so this is what I'm going to use for
getting a count of the sales now
grouping by might be we will change this
instead of
uh instead of sales we have using a ship
mode what we can also do is let's go for
a
segment and that would be valid grouping
so it will take a combination of ship
mode segmenting group the data based on
that and then get me the sales which
is which is basically let's call it
shipment wise
sales so it gets a sum so let's do a
okay and that's my more relevant data
which I'm looking at so I'm looking at
the ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically
having a combination of two Fields so
that has to be unique and your grouping
is done based on that so now you're
looking at the sales wise and this is
something as an important information
what we have so we have done some
transformation and what you can do
is you can use other ways like you can
use pivote to get individual values from
it you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is instead of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do do a paste and I
have done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping by
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based on your segment and
based on the sales so that's what we are
looking for so let's go for the ship
mode and we go for group Buy
and here you would want to go for
advanced to ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment wise
sales so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say okay
and that basically gives you the data
here
now what we have is we have the
resultant data based on the data which
is coming in from here we did the same
thing just 1 minute back but we worked
on the original data set so what I did
was I created a copy and now I'm working
on this one so I'll say close and
apply and now we are back to our desktop
so it is applying these changes where we
have done some Transformations we have
done some grouping by and what we can do
is once we have the data here we can
anytime look at our data sets or tables
so this is my original one if you see
now I have order summarized I can just
pull out this information I basically
have my returns which we have not really
touched and we have the scientist so we
have all the four data sets here now
what we can also do is let's look into
order summarized and we just have this
data here so this is fine and you can
continue working on this you can
basically merge columns from two
different data sets and then you can get
the merged column and you can rename it
so you can obviously do that you can
basically do a
uncheck whenever you're are working on
these data sets so what you can do
is if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here and say I want to do some
transformation on it so how did we do it
we just did a
transform and you can go back to
transform so you have this data here and
the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will will
be loaded and they will still be
available but this will not affect your
it will not affect your original one so
for example let's say copy and let's go
in here I will do a paste let's say
orders oh I did a paste I need to rename
this so let's renaming let's say orders
and here I will say summarize
and I will say
us so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have
here where is my country so let's look
for
Country yeah and let's look for Country
so here I will go for only United States
okay that's what I'm interested in and
then I can choose well I interested in
just Central us so I can basically go
for just the central us and I can get
rid of all of
these so now I should have only Central
us data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visualization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product name so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have Let's
uh let's not restrict it to region
region would then reduce my data but
that's good enough for us I can just say
no I'm clearing off this filter I'm
still looking at United States but I
want to look at all the regions yeah
what we would be interested in category
and that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data we have copf and machines right
and we can basically keep this now this
is fine I can apply the
changes I can apply the changes based on
this one and what I can do is I can just
say for now
apply so that's going to apply all the
changes which you have done in orders or
summary or the new one right and what I
can do is now I can choose order and I
can say don't enable this in load so it
says disabling load will remove the
table from the report and any visuals
that use its columns will be broken we
are not creating any visuals as of now
the table will be removed so that's
fine and now I will say close and apply
so what happens is you are loading the
data based on the changes okay now you
have
your order summarized you have returns
you have scientist but you basically do
not have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so I only have this one I only
have this one
and you have returns you have scientist
you don't have the orders column right
now that particular data set was not
loaded at all because we did not choose
that to be loaded right now while I'm in
this orders which
is let's see here and actually you can
drag in yeah so you have order summary
and this has basically kind of data
which I'm looking for so I really don't
need the orders stable so you can do it
in steps and you can aggregate this you
can have aggregated data you can have
all the data which is filtered
transformed grouped by and then
basically just load it and the original
data set which you used that's no more
being loaded here now at any point of
time time if I really
want I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue working on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joints right joints you have inner
joints outer joints so you can always do
that you can take two different data
sets might be I'm interested in taking
the orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment wise
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the
values these have the values say for
example the segment column here and the
segment column here can really be used
to join these two tables so if I create
a relationship or if I create a join I
can basically merge the data so this is
how you work on data we will also see
some more examples on might be modeling
the data using some Expressions to work
on the data so we already looked at
creating a report selecting particular
fields
and then publishing the report onto your
powerbi service now this is the report
which we had created which says State
order ID sales and then I also added
this returned field and that was
basically by creating a relationship
between order and returns which we can
also have a look in model so this is the
relationship which is created if you
just place your cursor here it tells me
that we have a relationship between
order ID of returns and Order ID of
orders and that basically allows me to
join the data bring it in my one report
now this is basically your data sources
you can look at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you your
report now what we can also do is we can
make it interesting now we would not
want to scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order ID which was returned now
I can do a sorting I can filter out what
I can also do is I can use this option
which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a Fe which has no value how do we
do that so basically I can drag and drop
the
returned here as a field which comes
from returns now that basically shows me
only the value as yes but I do know that
there is there are some fields which are
blank now how do I add filter to this so
I can click on this one and then I can
click on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes
or you have the blank field for returned
so what we can do is we can select yes
you will see
only the orders and their IDs and sales
where the products were returned so that
gives me 108,000 118 and I can select
blank so that will basically get me all
the orders or products which were not
returned now this is a simple way
wherein I can add a filter to or a
slicer to my report to basically give
viewers a choice of uh selecting
different fields and you can add any
number of slicers you can basically say
I would want particular kind of
information so for example if I go into
orders and we know we have the state now
I do have the state information here and
basically I can if I would be interested
I could filter this out in my report
itself I can sort it I can look it in a
different order what I can also do is
how about bringing in state here and
basically dragging it here so that gives
me the state option it is giving me a
visual which is basically giving me a
geographic location of all these points
so yes that can be good what I can also
do is I can keep this which basically
shows me the state map mightbe it can be
useful
you can zoom in you can zoom out you can
look at specific information here you
can drag and drop here so that's fine
what I can also do is I can again take
the state and bring it
here and that basically can be instead
of my map I can go for slicer so that
gives me all the values here and which
basically allows users to choose the
fields
or the states which you would be
interested in looking at so for example
if somebody is interested in looking at
the data for georia just select this one
and you see the map automatically shows
you where in the map that's the place
and it shows me all the sales for
Georgia State now I can also basically
select yes and that shows me which were
the orders which were basically returned
so that gives me a quick over view of
statewise what is the geographical
location if the orders were returned or
mightbe I can just click on blank and it
shows me The non- Returned orders I can
again go here and uncheck the joio
option and that shows me all the states
now once you have done this this looks
like a comprehensive report which can be
useful for the viewers for your
management team and so on so we can just
do a save and that basically is saving
my report so I have this report now what
if I publish this report so I can just
do a publish and when I publish it says
okay workspace so let's say
select and then it says replacing this
data set may impact two reports you
already have a data set named by this
one view the impact I would say replace
or I will say View impact so that
basically takes me to the powerbi
service because sometimes we may have
some reports which we have already
uploaded and updating an existing report
might basically affect my existing
report so it basically shows me the
impact analysis it shows me one
workspace there are two reports they
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here and let's look into my
powerbi so go back to your desktop and
I'll say no I don't want to replace so
click on cancel so I do not want to
publish it what might be what I can do
is I can try saving it as a different
report so let's say save
as and now I will basically
say
additional filters
okay let's save it so now you see the
name on the top changes to additional
filters now it's save to publish this
and now I can go ahead and publish it
select your
workspace and basically it says this is
the report being published with our
additional filters with a map which
gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my powerbi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and might be it's a
good on option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of powerbi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built now once the
insights are ready it will let you know
what we can also do is we can come in
here click on view data set so you see
now it shows your additional filters and
here you have option where it should be
showing your report so let's say View
and view is fine so and if it doesn't
show up sometimes it might be taking
time for refreshing so you can always go
here and then you can click on your
report and that should get
populated so this is the report these
are the filters which I have gives me an
option of choosing all the states and
basically allows me to edit the report
and look at all the information here
meanwhile we can see here it is still
trying to gather some insights from the
data and now you see there are some
insights here so it says sales which is
coming up and a subset of your data was
analyzed and the following insights were
found so you're looking at sales by ship
mode so it says standard class second
class first class and same day so there
were different shipping modes in our
data and that's what it shows me the
sales which one had the majority it
shows me the profit so which city or
state had more profits so New York City
has noticeable more profits here average
by shipping cost by subcategories so
there are these different subcategories
which we can look at such as copers and
machines have noticeably more shipping
cost profit by product name and you can
basically look at the row ID and
quantity so this is where you're looking
at a regression analysis you're looking
at row ID and quantity so there is a
correlation between row ID and quantity
so these are two different variables or
fields which are related you're looking
row ID by
category row ID so it says California
has noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a correlation again
between two different variables average
of shipping cost now we would have taken
lot of time in building all these
visualizations but powerbi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is what you're
interested in you can focus and look for
more information based on all the fields
it has given you good amount of insights
which will help anyone who is looking at
this particular report so that's your
quick insights here and we have this
information now once you have this
information this is basically where you
have your focus mode so it says subset
of your data was analyzed following
insights were found you can basically
say
download and uh here you have other
options which allow you to work with
your powerbi so let's look at this one
so this is where we have our report and
we can continue exploring it
more one more interesting feature which
powerbi has other than having your
insights ready to use which is basically
in your workspace and you can basically
use these insights what we are looking
at various options here and basically
you have this option where it says spin
the visual if you are interested in a
particular Insight you can always pin it
which you can always go back and look
into what you can also do is you can
also click on edit report here now
that's a report which has already been
published to your powerbi service not
yet shared but that can be shared or
that can be subscribed now once you
click on edit report it has option of
reading View mobile layout you have
basically an option which says basically
options for navigating through the data
set you can go for how visuals on the
canvas interact with each other you have
all these options and one of the good
options is ask a question so you can
always click on ask a question and that
basically B
says some suggestions now you can open
this and it says okay ask a question
about your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report has only four
Fields so it has State order ID sales
and returned with some filters but what
about you looking at how many ship modes
are there so it is already looking at
your data so if you click on this one
here and you can see what are the
different fields what we have and you
have ship date and ship mode so this is
one of the fields which it is showing
you to ask a question now what you can
do is you can say how many ship modes
are there let's click on that let's ask
this question it says four ship modes
and do you want to add this to report
yes you can you can let it be as it is
so you can basically keep this question
here and here you have an option the
visual is showing number of ship modes
when you place your cursor here if you
see here turn this Q&A result into a
standard Visual and let's do that and
basically it is saying number of ship
modes right so now that's the power of
your uh bi power bi which has basically
allowed you to ask a question and
quickly add a visual to your report now
what we can do is we can basically save
this or you can say save as and give a
different name so mightbe I'll just say
save because I would want to have this
information and the report is saved so
in this way you can basically not only
create smart visuals you can not only
relate different data sources using data
models or relationships you can add maps
you can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say
um what is
the uh highest
shipping cost and that shows me some
suggestions let's select that and that
shows me the
value which is great and I can keep it
as it is I can basically convert this to
a visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and uh you would want to see the result
here might be you can move this
somewhere
here and that gives me some kind of
question which was asked and we can do a
save and that's my report which has been
saved
in my bi service the data set is still
there you can basically go ahead and
share this how to connect different data
sources with powerbi so in this session
today we will see how can you connect
different type of data types data sets
like Excel PDF CSV Etc to import in
powerbi for your data visualization
needs so what's in it for us today we
will be learning how to connect to data
different data types data files like
Excel PDF then what are the different
data importing modes and then I will
also show you practically different sets
how to import them in powerbi and use it
for your visualization purpose now what
are the steps to connect to data so now
we will go directly into powerbi and try
to import one by one few most commonly
and popularly used data sets which are
most commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will uh do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data directly from a web page and import
the data now it is asking for a URL in
order to import data so what I have done
is I have created a Google Excel sheet
with simple data with rows and columns
and what I've done is I've have Shar
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your tblo paste it
link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables so I'll select this one now you
can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my tblo and I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my power
query editor I clicked refresh all and I
got my new row which is there in the
live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important
way in which you can import data now
let's try to import data from a text
file now I have already prepared a text
file called subcategories do
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the heading ERS Etc right and
I can now directly load this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using MySQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now our next task is to import from CSV
let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
this CSV file let me open this CSV file
and show you what in is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay okay so now my products are
there product subcategories are there
for product categories now what I have
done is I have created a Excel mode now
so now Excel I'm using to import my
product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories though
with different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I've have done is I have created a
PDF called customers my customers data
is lying in a PDF so what I've done is
I've created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set which I have created in PDF
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF
table so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I have done is I've already
installed my SQL server on my local
instance and there's already
a schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to First
download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install the my SQL connector based on
the operating system you have you click
on download and install it after you
have done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in my C okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between
powerbi and my SQL now I want to do the
same thing using SQL Server Microsoft
SQL Server so I have also installed
Microsoft SQL server on my machine and I
have used the SQL Express so this is the
name of my server so which I'll copy the
server name and go to get data select
SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables are I can import so in my SQL
Server tutorial in my SQL Server I
have I have these three tables customers
employe Tre Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which is
now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can view the data
in uh powerbi that this is the data so I
can rename is customers from
mssql and this is
from my
SQL and
okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
of what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
within the folder whatever uh data types
of files are there it will detect it PDF
Pary or even SharePoint folder which is
itself a
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgress
uh sbase Terra dat and then sa uh uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and N number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data ver Etc
azour there are different kind of
storage uh mechanisms in azour and azour
itself is a Microsoft Technology so it
has a compatibility with lot of azour uh
based data storages like azour SQ
database blob
storage uh aure data braks right aure HD
Insight spark so if you have those kind
of services running on your AER cloud
services you can even import them over
here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
uh LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other miscellaneous are also
there web based Hive R script python
script if there something to import get
data from uh Google Sheets like we saw
one example in our video right now so
there are multiple options available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you're
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationship ships either keep them as
is you can delete and create new ones
manually so there is no limitation in
that so this is what we have witnessed
we have imported data from different
files types data types and then you know
we have tried to once it is imported
into uh powerbi then there is no
limitation of how you use it you can
create create visualizations across
different data sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a PDF and then once
you have data you can shape and combine
data you can basically do what whatever
transformation you want to do you want
to uh make joins merge the data so for
example if we go back to our powerbi and
if I go back to my transform data
section now as I have now different data
sets available with me I have I can do
any kind of U you know operation
transformation on the data right uh so
like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or or this columns like
this exact one column is extra I can
remove the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right looks for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product
subcategories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization data
modeling in
powerbi now today we will discuss how to
create relationships and different kind
of data models within powerbi based on
the structure of data you're
importing okay so what topics we are
going to cover today we going to talk
about different types of data modeling
and the most important part and aspect
of data modeling is the cardinality the
cardinality which you basically decide
after reviewing the nature of data and
after you imported it what kind of
cardinality you have to basically
highlight right and there are different
type of carties which you might have
heard earlier also if you are from plsql
background like one is to one one is too
many Etc we will we will talk about
that now what are the different types of
data modeling now dimensional data
modeling is one of the most popular and
most uh you know widely used uh modeling
in dimensional data modeling you have
Master data uh like for example customer
data date store data product data so
these are like you know uh less
frequently changing data sets so there
is an organization right and you have
set of customers their email ID phone
numbers Etc that will change less
frequently as compared to the sales
transactions because transactions are
happening every day every minute so
sales is a more fast changing data set
in dimensional modeling which is in the
terminology of data uh is also called as
a fact and customer store product which
are like more of static data and less
changeable data is sometimes called a
dimension so this is a typical
dimensional data model which is
typically used uh sometimes right and
then there is another model which is
relational model this is a typical model
which we have been using in database
design like you know primary key foreign
key relationships so for example you
have a customer who has purchased a
product so probably he might have the
customer might have the details of the
product which he has purchased and you
will make a join between customer and
product table and even uh you can make a
join between product or product type or
customer or product type customer table
will also have a key to the product type
so this is less uh conducive for
reporting but it is more of a
transactional uh relational model but of
course this is also feasible but from
the powerbi perspective when we talk
about reporting and visualization this
is the most extensively used dimensional
data model and this is what we going to
see in our example now so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you certain
data sets first we will prepare and uh
create certain of our uh data sets and
then we will Import in our sample power
BF file and then slowly slowly we will
create the
relationships now one important thing
which you need to understand that in
powerbi if you go to powerbi there is an
option that that powerbi autod detect
new relationships after data is loaded
and import relations from the data
source on first load so for example if
you are importing the data from a
database where you have already Define
the primary keys and the foreign key
relationships so uh that is the first
option which powerbi will autod detect
and secondly if suppose you are
importing two different kind of data
sets one is Excel one is csb
and if powerbi detects a common column
key columns it will auto detect a
relationship which you can go and later
change modify manage in your
relationship uh menu manage relationship
menu in powerbi which I'm going to show
you okay so if I open a powerbi and this
is where the option lies go to file go
to options and settings
options data
load and these are the two options which
are by default checked you can uncheck
it and auto and manually prepare
relationships there's no limitation to
that but if you keep it checked then
powerbi will do its job to detect the
relationships
okay now coming to the next important
factor cardinality
now before I start playing around with
my data and start showing you certain
relationships it's very important to
understand these four types of
cardinalities one is many to one right
so basically many to one means that many
orders contain data of One customer so
per order one customer is there so from
customer to order or product or delivery
address it's a one to many relationship
and from the other side from order to
customer perspective it's a many toone
relationship okay second other uh
cardinality is 1 is to one one is to one
relationship is only applicable when you
are saying it's an extension of the
current table so for example in one
table you have employee details and you
are extending the details of the
employee in another table like employee
address employee ID so that is like one
is to one there's no multiple records of
a single employee
in the address table only one employee
ID exists
right now one is too many as I said is
the reverse side of many is to one is so
in customer table only one customer
record exists per customer and one
customer can place many orders for
multiple products and can also have
multiple delivery addresses so that way
this is a typical 1 is to many
relationship we will be seeing this
example also in our sample data
set and last is the many to many
relationship now many to many is a very
typical example so which I'm going to
show you pra practically and in our case
we will see that like for example you
have placed an order for a particular
product uh you know but there are
multiple fulfillments which has happened
so suppose you made order for 10
products but at the back end when the
company is fulfilling it is first
fulfilling the first two products then
the rest three so basically your the
Fulfillment is happening in batches so
one order ID might have a multiple
fulfillments for the same order ID so
there will be a multi many to many
relationship which I'll show you
practically so now with this background
let's start importing our data now the
first important thing which we need to
import is the master data so first I'll
import all my master Dimensions which
are which I'm going to you know use in
my example so first is the customers
table customers
data so this is the customer details
like customer key prefix first name last
name birth date marital status and
gender some redundant columns are also
present but we'll remove it
so my customer data is loaded now
today's session is all about this
section of modeling so we will keep our
Focus over
here okay now some columns probably some
blank columns are there I can select
them and say delete from model yes
okay so now this is my customers data
with the relevant columns and the key
per customer customer key now there's no
relationship in this model right now
right because only single table is there
and the associate data is only imported
now let me also import my another
important master table is the
products select the product data product
key product subcategory
product SKU product name model name
product description color size so just
see all the relevant information only
specific to the product is available so
I'll import
it okay now see there's no relationship
between product and customers directly
because until unless a customer makes an
order places an order for a particular
product there is no join right so now
between these two tables the most
important now another table which will
now make sense is the sales order table
sales
table now I I'm assuming that powerbi
have autod detected the relationship now
you can see that because I've already uh
ticked that check box now let's let's
see what powerbi what relations powerbi
has autod detected let's first check the
relation between customer and sales I'll
double click
this uh join now what it has done is it
has created a join of many to one
between sales and customer so what does
that mean is that one customer has can
uh Place many orders right and that is
that it has detected by the quality of
the data and the data sampling which
powerbi has done you can also reverse
this relationship here I can select
customers and I can select sales now it
has become one too many so that you can
also do manually so that is what I said
whatever powerbi is detected it is up to
the descrition of powerbi internal um
configuration and algorithm but you can
go and change it so this is now you can
make this is by default active so we
want to keep it active One customer many
sales orders cross filter Direction
means that only from customers to sales
is the filter applicable not reverse
I'll come to this with my another
example but first let's change the
relationship so one is to many means
from One customer and many sales
orders similarly let's see what has
happened at the product side of the
relationship
similarly powerbi many sales orders for
one product you can for Simplicity sake
you can say products
sales product key is the join now just
focus one more thing please uh also see
the the column on which the join is is
the grade column grade out column
product key is also here and product key
is also there and it is what we wanted
so one is to many relationship from
product to sales table and active now
looks fine this is something which is
looking logical and probably now we can
proceed further to create a report now
let me explain the cross filtering with
an
example now for example I want to check
in a
report that what is the count of
products
which uh which a particular customer has
ordered
okay so what I'll do is I'll select the
product count of product
name now if you
see the and for each customer in front
of each customer name the count is
coming as 293 293 it is getting
repetitive because because there is a
oneway filter Direction filter between
customers and sales and sales and
products right so this
join is single sided it means that from
customer to product you can't find a
relationship because it's a single side
cross filter right what does this if I
change it to both it means that it is
equal to a join between product and
sales and every product detail now is
appended to the sales table so if I want
to make you visualize this is you need
to go
here I'll first open my sales
table we can also open it here let's
make click it this okay now if I click
okay you can see the single arrows
changed to Double Arrow it means it's a
it's a both side filter So when you say
a both side filter it means that
implicitly within powerbi you can
imagine that all the product columns now
will get appended because of both ways
filter you have applied and if you go to
your report now see the change of the
numbers now 40 20 so the total count of
products across all my customers come
out to be 293 now the report looks uh
correct if I change the relationship
from back to single between product and
sales then you can't make a joint
between customers and product basically
you you can't derive the product count
from the product table see
this if you have to live with it then
you would have to go to the sales table
get the product key and get the value of
count of product key but that is not
correct
okay so if you want a report in which
you want the count of product name and
even if you want to count of distinct
product name so this will not come
correctly you would have to go and
change the direction of the filter which
is from single to both so this is a
typical example there where you want to
use a twood directional
filter now let's proceed further and
import other data set in order to give
show you another example now I want to
show you an example of one is to
1 so I have another table which is
called customer details so the key in
this table is again customer key but
only email address annual income total
children education level Etc other
details of the customer is
there so I'm loading the customer
details now you see it has autod
detected a 1 is to one one
relationship what is the meaning of 1 is
to one means One customer key only has
one entry in customer details there is
no multiple entry so if you click this
button it's a 1 is to one and the cross
filter can be both or single doesn't
matter because one customer will have
only one value you can make this as
active okay and if you go to the
customer report table you can now
easily associate
a email address with the first name you
will get 1 is to one
record so now you can see that with one
is to one
relationship with the first name I have
Associated the email ID and for each
email ID there is a Associated first
name with that so this this is an
example of 1 is to one relationship so
in this example what we have explained
is that for each customer there is an
Associated customer detail right uh so
you have the first name email address
education level homeowner occupation and
total children count so in this report
what we have done is uh if you click
over here so the first name and the
email address okay okay so there's a one
is to one
relationship and
then and if you
drag customer
key uh report takes time to render and
even if you
can so this is the reporting output you
have the customer key first name
associated email address and the account
of product names uh which the customer
has ordered now this is an example of 1
is to one now I want to show you an
example of many to many now for that
I'll import my fulfillment data set
okay now in my fulfillment data set
there is a column
for order number so basically what I'll
do is I'll drag order number from here
to
here okay so now what has um uh powerbi
detected I'll do one thing I'll select
sales over here fulfillment over here
and order number to OD number okay so
it's a many to many relationship so it
means that per order I have created
multiple batches to fulfill that
particular order
now many to many relationship is a
definitely a candidate for both ways
cross filter detection uh Direction but
you can you can check that but
definitely uh powerbi shows a warning
that this relationship has cardinality
to many to many and this should only be
used if it is expected that neither
column contains unique values okay so we
know that fact that's why we are
accepting this relationship as many to
many because we know there are multiple
order numbers over here in the sales
table which are maap to the multiple
order numbers in the Fulfillment table
we'll click
okay now you want to keep uh the uh
direction as both ways or One Direction
that is up to you the way you want to uh
map the report so I can double click
over here and you can even click so now
you can select from which way single
filter you want from fulfillment to
sales or sales to fulfillment I'll
prefer for sales to fulfillment and
click
okay okay now we have our all our
different kind of relationships over
here uh which we have tried to short
list one to many many to one one to one
which is uh this example and many to
many now if I show you further
relationships which you can keep on
adding like for example I have uh uh the
example of
territories now in which particular
territory the sales was done so I can
map it over
here okay so now it's a typical 1 is to
many relationship because territory is
my master table uh where I have a static
list of continent country region and it
is mapped to the uh territories which
are for in which my orders have been
placed so it's a typical one is too many
so that way you know you can keep on
adding data then you
have uh details of
returns now this is another
transactional table which is about the
orders which have been returned rather
than being you know returned by the
customers so you have a product key H so
automatically powerbi has detected a
relationship between the product key and
the product uh table right and even if
you can join the territory key in which
territory the return has happened right
so mostly the most common relationship
which you will observe is the one is to
many because as I told earlier the most
common relational model is the
dimensional model uh the static data the
slow changing Dimensions the scds are
the master tables and the most frequent
changing are the fact tables so if I
talk about a typical dimensional model
the Fulfillment table sales table and
the terator table sorry uh the
Fulfillment table sales table and my
returns table are the fact tables of my
data model so what exactly you mean by
data transformation in
PBI so data transformation can be a
little similar to data cleaning so
before any kind of data analytics you
might be receiving raw data from a
website Source a SQL database or an
Excel file or multiple sources right
once after you receive the data whether
it is batch mode data or streaming data
you are supposed to clean it right you
might have to clean up the discrepancies
like the blank rows or the blank cells
or any irregularities in data such as
wrong data type right such discrepancies
from the data should be eliminated in
the first stage of data analytics so
that's exactly where data cleaning and
data transformation comes into the
picture so you have various tools for
data cleaning and data transformation
like Excel SQL but if you are a powerbi
user then good news for you power query
and powerbi can assist you in terms of
data Transformations so in this tutorial
we will be discussing the fundamental
the most important day-to-day data
Transformations which a data analyst
takes care of in the process of data
analysis is what we going to discuss
today so let's quickly switch to powerbi
but before that let's have a overview of
what kind of data we are exactly dealing
with today so we are dealing with
Superstore D and that's in Excel format
so this is our Superstore data set and
we have four tabs here the first one is
orders tab where we have customer ID
order ID date ship date ship mode and
customer name and in the second tab we
have stour data set which has the
details about the customer from where he
or she is the state City postal code and
which category or subcategory did they
purchase and Order sales discount profit
everything right and here we have some
information about any of the orders
which were returned and some people over
here so these are the four tabs that we
are dealing with today now that we have
an overview on the data that we're
dealing with let's quickly now switch to
PBI so now we are on the PBI window can
just discard
changes there you go let's quickly
import the data from our downloads this
this is the data that you want to deal
with today now it might take a little
while to connect to that particular data
set and load the data onto CP just a
couple of minutes since the data set is
a little too heavy it's about
10,000 so let's wait shouldn't take long
there you go the data got successfully
loaded so you have the option of loading
what kind of data you want you have four
tabs as we just discussed you can load
the orders Tab and you can load the
stores Tab and in case if you want the
returns tab you can also load that and
if you want all of those just load all
of those right now I just want the two
tabs orders and stores now here I can
just directly load to get started
working on this but in case I don't want
any kind of discrepancies in case if I
have a doubt that this data might not be
cleaned I shall go with data
transformation so ideally you should go
with data transformation check your data
first before any kind of analytical
processes so let's go with that
transform
data and shortly we should be having the
power query window open on our desktop
screens
so there you go you can see the complete
data set has been successfully uploaded
both these stores and alter data sets
now uh let's quickly check the data from
our data set so here you can see we have
orders date right but I can see 4
2682 and
4253 this is not in the form of date
correct so this is the simple uh uh step
that we discuss changing the wrong data
type so you can just click on the lower
arrow button over here and uh or we can
right click and here you have an option
to change the type correct so it is
considering it as a whole number which
is is wrong so you can change it
to
date replace
current so now we trying to change the
order date from a data type whole number
to date data type so there is some error
if you click on error or if you just
navigate onto it powerp should be able
to show you what error was it in just in
case if it's not working okay we are
unable to pass the value provided so you
can just remove that and try it in a
different way change type
to date and time
zone
date I think this should
be helpful
or if it's not working here let's
quickly check what could be the
ER
time and now let's try to refresh the
data it is taking a little while
uh we also have another information that
we deal with we have the first row as
row headers so we should be declaring
PBI that we also have a row header over
here just taking a little while to
refresh meanwhile let's quickly check
into the stores data and here we have
customer name so let's try to apply
second type of data transformation which
will be like let's say split column we
have uh the complete name of U the
customer let's try to split it into
first name and second name so by the
limiter and we can give multiple options
over here left mostly limit let's say a
person has three uh parts of his name
first name middle name and second name
or the last name so but we just wanted
to split into first and second name so
we would go with the first left mosty
limiter and split the D set press okay
and it should help us to split the
data first name and second name and we
can also name the column separately as
first name and second name instead of
custom wiing it's taking a little while
than the ideal time but it's completely
all
right since considering the 10,000 rows
of stores data and 10,000 rows of ERS
data it is all right not a problem now
let's try to take a look at the aut
status it has successfully changed that
no it is still showing as an error I
don't know what's wrong
here just maybe in
complete let's quickly refresh
All in St preview and check if can it
can help
us so there you go after refreshing the
first order date is Chang change to dat
type so what we missed is when you
change the type you're supposed to add a
step so what exactly I mean by that now
we are trying to change the second one
as well so just wait for a while and it
will give us uh choice if we want to add
new step or not that's when we select
the option yes please add a new Step so
what do I mean by steps so applied steps
you can see something over here right so
every alteration every change or every
modification that you're doing every
transformation you're including on your
data will be recorded as a macro so that
can be implemented if you are loading a
similar data set for the next patch
let's say this is 2022 data and if you
are trying to analyze the 2023 data and
every column is similar and you can just
follow these appli steps and the same
implementation will be automated you
don't have to spend time and doing the
same process once again there you go so
this time it has recorded this step and
it automatically take has taken a new
step over here chain stpe step one
change type step two if you don't want
the step to be added you can just select
the red x mark over here it will remove
it and similarly when you when you go
back to the stor data set here you have
the first name and second name split
successfully and uh now uh let's say you
want to have unique customer data right
in that scenario you can just even
remove duplicates from this particular
column just remove duplicates and you'll
just have unique data it's possible that
one customer might have come here to buy
the same uh Pro you know buy the same
product from different dates or One
customer might have uh done a repeated
purchase so it's possible but again if
in case if you just want to know if
there is a way to eliminate duplicate
entries then you can do that so for now
let's not delete the customer IDs here
because one customer might have visited
the same store for multiple times and
might have purchased a different uh
product or might have made the same
order with multiple products right so
there is a possibility for that let's
not disturb the data set so I just
wanted you to know if there is a way to
eliminate the duplication from the data
set yes it is now let's also check
another possibility of data
transformation so let's say you wanted
to add a new column and identify or
include some mathematical operations for
now let's say I have sales quantity
discount and profit but I don't know
what's the rate right so here the sale
is for to $61 and quantity is to but I
don't know what's the rate of one
product so I can include that you can
just select the last column or where you
want a new column just go to the add new
column here and here you can just uh
choose the custom
column should be somewhere over here
yeah this is the custom column and now
if you click on the custom column you
can rename the custom CLW column to rate
of
product and here you can choose the
mathematical operations to be applied on
the columns so sales column insert
or double click divided by
quantity okay now it should give you the
rate of each product indivisual
product it is taking some sizable time
which don't take so long so there you go
you have the r of product and now let's
say you want to combine multiple data
set that's for example here I have
stores data set but my stores data set
doesn't have any data related to orders
and orders does not have any data
related to customers now I want to
combine these two is there a way yes you
can do that now let's get back to stores
and here go to home option and here you
have something called merge queries so
now the stor data set has been selected
in the first data set here just select
the drop down and select the second data
type just order so here you can see
stores with the current one which is in
the first place now select based on
which primary key you want to combine
both so I want to go with customer ID
because both of my data sets do have
customer IDs so I'll go with customer ID
and both data say will be combined at
the end at the last column powerbi will
show me a new table not a new column it
will give me a table combined with all
the columns in one column you just have
to expand the column and select which
columns from the second data set you
want to include in your overall data set
so let's do that practically so here you
can see I just have tables if I select
the expand column option over here you
can see I have a lot of columns here so
just deselect everything I do have row
ID I do have a customer ID what I need
is order ID order date shift date
shipment mode and customer name I do
have it so that's all I need so just
press on okay and I should have them
included in my new data set Al
together it might take a little
while so there you go we have the new
orders ID order date shift date and ship
mode added to our data set now just
click on close and apply
and your data set is already ready for
data analysis Supply changes it is
taking a little time so at the end you
just have to click on the apply changes
and your data will be ready for analysis
so that's exactly how you can perform
data transformation in powerbi desktop
version so there you go the set got
successfully loaded all over here and
you can just drag and drop them onto the
visualization spot and you can work on
your dat yes so now the power Pi visuals
are on the screen you can see we have
file home and add data to your report
visualizations filters data Etc right
for now I think we don't have any data
we can quickly import the data onto this
particular platform and starter analysis
but before we get started with that
everybody knows there are simple tricks
to create all the type of visualizations
right if you expand if I if I could
expand my screen here you can have have
all these visuals and let's say if I
just double click here and if I want any
type of visual it'll just show me the
visual right let's say I want a bar
graph for the sales happening in all the
regions so I'll just double click I'll
tap it down give me a bar graph for
sales right it will give you and just in
case if you wanted the pie chart for the
country wise you can just give
country-wise sales by chart right but
now let me tell you a few things okay
cor so if you are using a pie chart and
if you are dealing with let's say a lot
of companies or I mean countries a lot
of countries like 20 countries or 25
countries right in that scenario pie
chart look a little clutter all right
and let's say you wanted to find out the
sales that are happening in the region
wise and you asked power be to create a
line graph for that that would not give
you the proper visual that will not give
you the proper visualization to be
honest right so as a beginner if you are
learning powerbi the most fundamental
thing is not just understanding how the
tools in the powerbi work what kind of
visualizations you have the most
critical thing that you will need to
know after understanding the basics is
what type of chart is to be used for
what kind of visualization right so
that's exactly we are going to discuss
today what kind of data requires what
kind of visualization let's say I'm
working with date data type let's say
I'm working with sales data type let's
say there is a requirement where I need
to present the data in form of table or
a card then what are those scenarios and
if I want to use the pie chart or bar
graph then what kind of data types that
I need to deal with what are the
situation where I need to use the bar
graph and where I shouldn't right a few
basic fundamentals that we will be
dealing with today so we have
a wide variety of bar graphs in the
first row and a wide variety of line
graphs in the second row which deal with
the line graph area area graph ribbons
Etc and in the third row we have
waterfall funnel scatter plot pie chart
donut chart tree map and next we have
map and right filled map and we have uh
the gauge cards and everything right and
here we also have a kpi right so we'll
also go through a kpi uh type of chart
and if you want to learn about the kpis
exclusively then we have the kpi
tutorial and powerbi lined up in this
particular Series so you can also go
through that and after that we have some
slicers and we have tables and we have
Matrix right so a wide variety of charts
available correct so we will try to
understand the major ones the first true
bar graph which are the scenarios where
you need to use the bar graphs next R we
have the line right line area so all
these come under one uh kind of uh set
they are similar to one another so which
is a scenario where you can use a line
graph which is a scenario where you can
use a waterfall or a funnel chart which
is a scenario where you can use a
scatter plot which is a scenario where
you can use a pie chart right a wide
variety of uh probabilities a wide
variety of permutations and combinations
so what are the exact needs what are the
exact visualizations that carry a value
that carry a meaning to the state
stakeholder which are those particular
charts which explain the numbers in the
right way possible so that's the point
of today's discussion so to begin with
let's import the data first from the
Excel document so we will be using the
Excel data over here just click okay now
you have a wide variety of tables which
are present in that particular workbook
we are dealing with the data tab so just
click on it select and load if there are
any mistakes or if there are any
discrepancies powerbi will let you know
and it will also it has the caliber to
also fix those particular data rows
right so there is one or seven errors
right now you can choose to close but
the overall tutorial is about learning
the type of visualization right so seven
rows out of 10,000 will not make a huge
difference for us right now because we
are trying to just understand the basic
understanding of what type of charts to
use so I'll just quickly close this but
in case if you want to fix you can just
click on this view errors and the power
query will open up in the background you
can just switch to the power query Tab
and fix the data rules where they really
need to be fixed right so let me close
it for now and now in a short notice you
can see we have the data loaded here now
we have two types but if you let me let
us imagine that you're on tblo and on
Tab you have two things dimensions and
measures right so measures is
self-explanation
anything that deals with numbers is
called as measure and anything that
deals with characters or names or
anything such which is not a number is
considered as a dimension right so here
we have category City Country customer
ID so these are the ones which can be
considered as dimensions and where you
have a summation logo or a mathematical
symbol right in front of it can be
considered as a measure right now let's
say we wanted to create the month on
month sales report correct which deals
with the data type so just uh data data
type right just remember whenever date
is included in your parameters either
you're adding it to the rows or columns
just make sure that you are using the
line chart which is over here so let's
quickly rename our page to line charts
or
graphs
correct now we have named that now you
can either choose to double click and
add that and then here you have xais and
y axis or you know you can just drag the
order datee expand this order date and
the hierarch is over here so if you want
to go with the month on month you can
simply add this to x-axis and you can
have your sales data somewhere over here
drag this to y axis this is one way of
creating it but in case if you don't
want to waste time in this particular
huge uh process you can just choose to
Simply double click on the canvas and
write it on here line
chart sales month click and there you go
right brilliant now if you choose to
Spotlight or you can just expand this
right and if you choose the spotlight
you can see a vertical line showing you
the numbers correct we start from
January and all the way to December
right and here you have the monthon
Monon sales so remember whenever the
date data type is included in one of
your parameters then the best way to
represent the best way to visualize the
reports will be the line dra right with
that let's switch to the next one now
since we were supposed to discuss the
the bars first but let's it's it's okay
not a problem so let's discuss the bar
charts now let us know the deta is at
first so we have sales profit discount
numbers Etc right and we have region
wise city-wise category wise country
wise so let's go with category now let's
go with category and try to build a bar
graph just double click anywhere and
category okay bar graph
okay if not category you can also choose
to have subcategory Okay g r a pH just
take care of your spellings I think I
missed an R over here bar graph
subcategory enter
sales there you go so you have your
chart right here if you just expand it
you can see we have a wide variety of
subcategories and powerbi was kind
enough for us to you know sort the data
in form of highest uh um ticket price or
highest selling product in the first
place and the lowest selling product in
the last place so this is how the bar
graphs work but just in case if you you
can tell me why couldn't we go with a
let's say pie chart right let a soldier
check that if I just click on this what
happens you can see a lot of cluttered
data right you have a lot of
subcategories here more than maybe 10
right so in this scenario the visuals
are a little displeasing and you don't
have the accurate value over here just
undo it and you have the bar graph which
is a a little clearer to look at a
little more you know decent to
understand what's happening you can just
focus on the top five over here and you
can understand what's going on right now
you can just rename them
as and you can choose to go with any
kind of bar vertical or horizontal or in
case if you have a few more let's say we
go with the category first and under the
category you have subcategory then you
can also go with that and you have an
overlapping type of graphs over here
stacked bar graphs which can show you in
that particular category which was the
product which was highest selling right
now you can also add that whereas the
category right you can just choose that
okay so I think we can open a new tab
and okay so we have the bar graph next
we have waterfall so let's open a and
let's name it as
waterfall so waterfall is uh something
which get performance of that particular
uh property or that particular entity
let's say I wanted to find out the ear
on ear or dat wise performance of that
particular subcategory in those
scenarios I can go with waterfall so
just simply double click and ask powerbi
to create a waterfall
model waterall
chart enter space
sale there you go so it's giving you the
period over period sales report of
subcategories and the green line indicat
that it is slowly growing in terms of
sales and sub and the red one shows the
decline in sales which is not happening
anywhere and this is the total the
overall you know the overall
subcategories so it will give you a
waterfall model and the overall total of
that particular uh segment is this much
and now we have dealt with subcategory
uh waterall model and let's try to
create a ribbon chart so ribbon chart
and the area chart those are similar to
one other stacked area area and ribbon
chart so ribbon chart will give you the
performance of that particular product
in the uh timely if you want to see the
performance of that particular product
in measured in terms of time let's say
uh month on month quarter on quarter
year on year day by day that can be done
using the ribbon chart similar to the
line chart but anyways let's take a look
I'll name it as ribbon and just double
click the PBI
canvas ribbon chart or just ribbon
subcategory
enter sale there you go if you write
order month you can also track the
monthly performance of those products
right you can see a study deine you can
see a study upline and uh so here you
can see the months and here you can see
the different colors of months the
different colors represent the months so
here are the products and based on the
products how is the monthly performance
right is it declining or is it um
increasing can find it out you can
basically find out that and uh moving
ahead we will deal with u scatter right
so first we dealt with the the bar
graphs next we dealt with the line
graphs and now we also dealt with
waterfall funnel which is something
similar next we have stacked chart
scatter plot chart right now scatter
plot is a little different let's say
you're dealing with numbers only numbers
nothing different usually what we do is
we carry out a dimension and a measure
right but in this scenario you want to
deal with only numbers let's say you are
providing some discount on all your
products and you wanted to know the
profit against the discount offer here
you're dealing with two numbers profit
and discount right so in those scenarios
what do you do so that's when you find
out by using the scatter plot just
double click on the canvas write it down
as build me a scatter plot just check
the spelling s c a t e r scatter
discount
enter and profit now it will create a
scatter plot based on discount and
against the profit now you can give some
uh Dimension you can go with
subcategory there you go now you have
the profit obtained against discount
offered based on different subcategories
just expand it and you can see in which
subcategory
what kind of discount was offered and
what kind of profits did you make so 25%
uh uh discount was being offered on
accessories and you made a profit still
you made a profit of
$33,000 and here you can see almost 200
discount was offered and still you I
think that is OnePlus One offer or maybe
end of the season sale but still they
made a profit based on some parameters
and here you can see see the least
discount and highest profit okay the
least profit and the highest discount is
in terms of tables which is 33% the
maximum out of everything and uh they
still did not manage to earn some good
profits out there so this is how you
create a scatter plot just quickly name
it as scatter and next we can deal with
the pie chart now just double click on
the canvas pie chart region
s so you have four to five regions here
and using a pie chart would make a good
uh impact on this particular visual as
everything seems clear and you can
easily make out which particular region
made the highest sale by just looking at
the size of these pieces right now let's
quickly name this as
SP and now let's move to the you can
just uh you know you can use the same
data for creating a donut craft you can
use the same data Ed to create a treay
map and yeah those are similar to one
another and let's let's quickly jump and
now let's create some maps right now
when do you need to use map type charts
let's say your data set has some
geographical data something like City
something like country something like
continent right or longitudes latitudes
anything which gets in touch or gets in
line with the geographical data then you
can proceed and build the map data types
I mean the maps correct so something
which is related to the map data type
you can build a map now let me double
click on the canvas and ask powerbi to
create a
map
country
sales there you go you have as simple as
that you have the country wise sales on
power PI right here you can also choose
to have Fil A map which will show you
how much sale is happening the darkest
color will indicate the highest sale and
the lightest color will indicate the
lowest sale now moving ahead we have the
cards and gauge so cards and gauge
completely similar to each other just
click on uh the powerbi double click you
can write card country okay let's go
with region because we don't want to go
or you can we don't want to have
multiple cards we just want to have
three to four cards on our dashboard so
we'll go with
category save so you just have a card
here right you can just keep it anywhere
on the corner in terms of real time
dashboard you you can just keep it
anywhere and uh let's name it as card
now let's proceed and create a kpi so
multi row card you can want to create a
multirow card let's say you have uh
let's go back to card and check it once
so if you create a multirow card we have
three categories and you can also add
add the subcategories of each category
so that's similar to a multi row card
correct now let's go back to the last
type or we have kpis and uh table so KBS
and table are completely similar to each
other let's try to go with the kpi now
we have discount profit sale and uh
quantity correct so kpi is something
which gives you the direct real time
number of what's happening with your
real time dashboard correct now how many
number of you know how many number of
products are sold what's the overall
sale that we perform what's the overall
profit that we receive what's the
overall discount that we offer in terms
of one single uh dashboard you can
create a kpi for that now let's let me
create a kpi discount first that's easy
as that now kpi for the profit enter
there you go now double click kpi for
sale enter there you go and lastly
kpi for
quantity there you go now that's how you
create the different types of charts so
basically if you integrate all these
charts into one page or One dashboard or
one canvas that's what you call as a
realtime interactive dashboard in Pap pi
and again coming back to the slicers if
you were using Excel you might have to
interconnect each and every single chart
using the report connection option but
in Pia you don't have to create that
particular report connection process you
can just click on the uh s or slices any
of the chart and you can click on the
any of the options let's say you wanted
to find out country wise sales you can
just click on the country provided right
so here somewhere you had yeah you have
Jan Feb and everything right so if you
just click on Jan every chart available
on the powerbi dashboard will connect to
it uh connect to the different unit
dependent charts and give you a real
time
information without having to create or
report connections to each other right
so basically if you just add all these
charts onto one particular canvas that's
when you get the realtime interactive
dashboard in powerbi and so I hope you
have understood what kind of chart you
need to use based on what kind of uh
data you have so we are on the powerbi
window right now so here we can see we
have already loaded the data we have the
filters visualizations Etc and we have
the canvas over here right so in the
visuals section if you closely observe
you have the kpi over here right so you
can either select and drag it onto the
canvas or you can just simply double
click and create a kpi but before that
what exactly is a kpi right it's the key
performance indicator right it's a full
form of kpi so what exactly is keep
performance indicator let's say we have
the sales dashboard over here sales data
set over here right now we have region
wise sales we have country-wise sales we
have region wise profits we have region
wise uh discounts we have quantity right
so it's like a visual it's like a number
clear literal readable number right on
top of your dashboard right so if you
just want to have a quick glance of how
many number of sales you made how's the
profit happening how's the sale
happening how's the discount that you're
getting right and how many number of
quantity of certain product is been sold
in a segment right so those are the key
performance numbers which will be
available right on top of your dashboard
so that's exactly what you call as a kpi
now how do you create a kpi so one way
is you can just hold the kpi and drag it
onto the canvas or so this is one way of
creating the kpi let's remove this now
another simplistic way of creating a kpi
is just double click anywhere on the
dashboard or the canvas and you'll have
this so so just write what kind of kpi
you want to create so I want to create
kpi for sales just create that and you
have your kpi there now another one kpi
discount just click on that you have the
kpi for discount double click once again
kpi for profits
have the kpi for profits now kpi for
quantity there you go that's how you
create kpis in PP should you need to
arrange the kpi sizes or color or
background you can also do that but just
simply playing around the sections over
here right the background or the the
outline section over here you can just
play with it you can increase the size
decrease the size add a background you
have a setting over here you can do
anything that you want right now we will
discuss about calculated columns now so
far what we have done as per our last
session is that we did data modeling on
the different data sets which we had
imported in powerbi like products sales
data returns fulfillment customer
details uh and customer Master data
calendar details Etc so in the last
session we prepared a data model and
established the relationships between
these different data ass sets like 1 is
to one 1 is to many many to one 1 is to
one Etc and we saw the examples now once
our relational model is uh prepared our
data model is prepared now our next
activity is to create certain additional
columns which we want to derive bases
the data which we have imported so for
example I'll start with my product data
set now in my product data set I want to
introduce a column which basically
categorizes that if any product which
has a color uh you know red black or
gray I'm going to tag it as a colored
product rest I'm going to say not a
colored product right so all these are
like example of by type product skus so
for that now in order to introduce a new
column you just need to do what you need
to select the table in the data grid go
to the table tools and say new
column okay so column will get appended
to the rightmost part and you will start
seeing a uh formula section typical to
like you get in your Excel now I'm going
to say that the name of my column is
going to be bik type color okay and I'm
just
creating a if condition
if
product
color is equal
to
Black
okay
or or if it is equal to
red or if it is equal to
gray then say yes it's a colored product
I'll
say
no okay so now you can see Bas is the
product color red and black they are
saying bike type color Yes blue is no
multi is no etc etc so this is a classic
example of an if and else condition
based conditional
column okay so you can create such
columns now second column custom column
which I want to create is I'm going to
call as
discount now basis the pricing of my
products I want to associate certain
discounts which I'm ready to give to my
customers Bas is the product category
like what is the pricing of the category
again I'm going to use make use of if
else but in a nested way so if I'm
seeing if
my
product price is less than 100 then I
will
give 0%
of uh 0 percentage of uh discount so 0o
into product price just to keep it
consistent now I'm seeing
else if less than 100 than zero else
I'll check again that
if the price
is less
than 500 then I'm ready ready to give 1%
discount on the product
price
else I move further so like this I have
created a
formula so what I'm saying is if product
price is less than 100 give 0% if it is
less than 500 then give 1% less than
2,000 then
1.5% less than 3,000 then 2% and
otherwise else less less than 3,000 if
it 2% else 3% right now after this
column is
created now you can check right so this
see the product price for this
particular product it is less than 100
so that's why there's no discount it is
uh between 100 to 200 then this has been
given a 1% discount so like this all the
discount column is now calculated now
this column is available just like a
regular column in my product table
now after this I'll go to my sales
table now in sales table I want to
identify
uh create a column called as cost there
is no product cost column over here so
that will be derived so let's create a
column
called as
cost and it is derived by order
quantity into now the cost of the
product is in the product table and I
know I've already created a relationship
between product and sales
table so I just need to select the
product cost column now only keyword
which I have to use in powerbi is the
related keyword so this will pick up the
relation and now for this particular
sale order the cost has already been
derived so this order number this is the
cost for which uh the product has is the
costing of the product for this
particular order
okay now I'm going to create another
conditional column over here called as
order
status I'm seeing if
any order whose order quantity is
greater than
two then for my organization it's an
urgent order else it is
a normal
order oh
sorry
I lost it
so this is
my order status column and I have my
order
quantity urgent or
normal so any order which has order
quantity one is normal any order which
is having order quantity as greater than
two is urgent you can see this so
there's
a this whole
powerbi uh tabs and sheets allow you to
also review the data what you're doing
so it's very
convenient
now I have my sales data now what I want
to bring within the sales is my discount
column so here also I want to bring the
discount which I have
created so I'll say
[Music]
discount discount will be order
quantity
into
related product discount right so the
discount calculated column which I had
created under products I'll bring over
here now I am creating the order level
discount so if you see for this
particular order there's a
25 uh uh you know for 25 rupe discount
at the cost is 100,000 rupees okay
and what is the order price now so I
have taken the order cost the discount
now I have to create a column called as
price order price so that will
be again order
quantity into
related price which is per
product price enter
okay so now I have the cost the discount
and the price right available with me
now I want to calculate the
total uh total revenue total profit and
loss
right per order how
much so first I'll calculate per order
how much revenue I'm generating so now I
have to generate a column called as
Revenue the revenue is
price minus discount
so 1700 - 25 1700 - 25 2071 - 42 and if
I want to calculate the profit per order
then it is
revenue Minus
cost okay so now you can see you know
typical custom columns calculated
columns which you have created are all
play play around with the number numeric
values numeric data primarily and trying
to give inferences into per order cost
discount per order price revenue and
profit so typical calculation columns
which I have prepared in front of
you now let's take a look at other
different variations of custom columns
uh I'll create certain columns for text
based custom columns calculated columns
uh using text based data so I'm now
moving towards my customer table in
which I have customer key prefix first
name last name birth date marital status
and
gender now I want to create a new column
in which I want to derive the age of
each customer as of today right so I'll
use another function a date function
called
as date
diff now date diff so I want the
difference between the birth date of the
customer and as of today in years
okay so this customer as of today 68
year old one is 74 68 57 Etc so this is
one derivation of a calculated column of
age let's take another example now this
is a text based column where I want
to derive the full name of the
customer now here I'll say
first lower case in lower case I'll
concatenate the
prefix then
ENT space
ENT first
name
ENT space
ment last
name and closing brackets
Etc full
name okay so this is an example of full
name in low
cases now another calculated column
conditional column at the customer level
I want to identify a flag which says who
is my Target customer bases the
demographics shared over here Target
customer so I'll
say
if the marital status is equal to
M
and total children
three and total children annual
income so okay so let me change the
logic a bit so status is M and
age
is less
than
50 these customers are my Target
customers okay so I would
say yes
else
no see this his marital status is
married Logan Dias and age is less than
50 else everyone so if I try to
filter so these are the my Target
customers 69 out of 1178 so this is just
a conditional column but a logical
condition an example which I'm trying to
highlight over over
here okay now let's look at certain
calendar date oriented columns
calculated
columns very typical like now I have a
simple date column now I'll keep adding
certain columns which uh you know which
help you which will help you understand
how you can
uh know do some calculations on the
dates so like for example I want a date
which is 12 days after the current date
the date in the column so just simple 12
Days After select the date and add
12 now if you see the date format you
can go and change the format at the top
and if whatever you feel like like this
now see 12 Days After 1st Gen 2015 is 13
gen 2005 you can go and change the
format and other
details let me also show you if I go to
my cost and other columns I can go and
change the format this is like a
currency cost is currency so I can go
and uh select the change the currency
type and you can even show the dollar
value or whatever currency type it
is so for numbers you can do currency or
text or dates you can select the format
so this is available at the column tools
level now in
customers like we had
our column of full name
so now what all things are available
format as text okay data type text so
very minimal options are there with date
you have options of the date
format now
next I want a column which defines the
expiry date okay so 8 months prior to
the expiry date with is which is uh
coming up in 8 months so I'll create a a
column called as 8 months
expiry and then there is a e date
function I'll use that I'll use
my date in the data
set comma I'll up say eight so now this
date column will append 8 months to
my actual date and again I can go and
change the
format correct now another important
column like I want to know the date
name so I'll use a function called as
format and I'll select my calendar date
column and I'll say give me the
ddddd format of it so it'll give me the
day name the day the day name of on that
particular
date
next ears in
between so I want the ears in between
the today's date and the date of my
calendar so equal to
date
diff the calendar
date comma
today comma
year
and 7 years 2015 to
2022 then last date of the month so if I
want what is the last date of this
particular calendar month I will use a
function EO month which is there
available in
the powerbi so I'll
say last date of the
month equal to EO
month
then just select the calendar CSV date
comma zero in months and enter
change the
format then similarly start of the month
so I'll use a function called start of
month so for for all January dates end
of the month is 31st Jan and start of
the month will remain 1st of
Jan change the format
next I want to know what is the week
number of that particular date so now
there is an inbuilt function
called week number week num and just
pass the date and you will get the week
number first week of the year second
week of the year Etc
now another
very good example is whether the
week day is a weekday or a weekend right
so what is it's a week type okay
so I'll CH I'll put a if condition and
there is a function called
weekday and I'll pass the
calendar if it is less than six it means
it's a
weekday else it's a
weekend so all
Saturday and Sunday day names will come
as weekends else everything else will
come as week
dat so these are very different
variations of different column types
calculated columns which is a very
important utility and uh and any brabi
project you will definitely be ending up
creating n number of calculated columns
to derive your numbers to prepare your
ports but it's important to understand
what all things we can do that yes there
are n number of functions available in
powerbi uh but uh what I have tried to
Showcase over here is some important
functions but basis your utility basis
your problem statement you can uh look
up for a relevant function in the
powerbi
dictionary now with
this introduction to calculated column
this is the base for us to now get into
our next next session where will be we
will be talking about creating Dax
measures and Dax functions we will be
using powerbi Dax functions which is
much more powerful than simple uh
calculated columns where you can do more
uh complex calculations uh you can
calculate totals and then use them in
the reports so for that we will look up
into our next session powerbi let's also
learn about Dax expressions and that's
basically your data analysis Expressions
so it's basically collection of
functions operators and constants which
can be used in formulas or Expressions
to calculate or return one or more
values now we can basically add a new
column so we can do that or we can also
create new measures now usually there is
a shorter way of doing it you can go
into modeling and here as of now nothing
is highlighted because there is no data
uploaded we see just a new table what I
can do is I can go to home and I can
let's get our data but this time I'll
take the simpler data although we can
work on the same earlier data set which
relates to IP addresses and all that so
that also can be done and to learn we
can take up this particular data which
is global super store which we have used
earlier now here I can set select orders
I can select people and I can also
select returns now what we can do is
before loading we can just do some quick
transformation on this particular data
so that opens up my power query editor
so here if you remember we have worked
on this this is returns so what I can do
is I can basically go in here I can say
use first row as headers now that's one
transformation which I would want to do
let's go into people and it basically
has person and region we will still do
the same thing use first row as headers
so that gives me the name of the person
and the person belongs to which
particular region you have then your
orders data set and here things look
fine so we can select different
countries we can select different
product categories we can basically work
on your different use cases here like we
have seen earlier picking up a category
as technology picking up a
subcategory and we can also create
models based on these three data sets so
this looks perfectly fine to me so let's
go ahead and just do a close and apply
and let's have our data quickly loaded
now as I have explained earlier it is
good to do transformation enough data
wrangling so that your data is not huge
when you're loading it because then that
that will slow down your queries slow
down your visuals slow down your reports
and so on now this is the data we have
and say for example I would want to work
on a visual so we know how we can do
that so I can basically click on my
orders I can look at the aggregated
columns such as discount might be postal
code might be profit and it depends if
you have basically not changed the data
type now if you see here postal code and
summation really does not go well
probably this has been as uh this has
been loaded as a data type which is
integer but profit and quantity looks
good row ID sales look good so we can
work on Dax Expressions now here if you
go into the modeling it says do you want
to create a new measure you can create a
new column that will get added to your
Visual and here when you are looking
looking into the table you can click on
this and this also gives you an option
of creating a new measure or a new
column new quick measure and you can
work on Dax so when I said Dax let's
quickly look at what or how Dax looks
like talk about Dax the simplest way to
understand is knowing the basic syntax
so usually you first have some kind of
measure name so for example we can say
average about about something we can say
okay let's say average sales so that
becomes one of my measure which I'm
interested in calculating now how do I
calculate that so for that I use an
operator so which shows here so that's
your operator which you are going to use
and then you use a Dax function so Dax
has or powerbi has lot of functions
which we can use so for example I would
use a function like average which we can
choose from the drop-down as we start
typing in now this one as a function
then needs a referred data table so
basically let's say I would be
interested in orders so I can select my
table or my data set as you say and then
you can choose a particular column so
from orders I would want to do an
average on say sales and I can key in
the column name here and that basically
is my simplest tax expression so we can
have a complicated way of looking at it
or we can basically say okay I would
want to find out average sales and I
would want to might be look into a
particular City or where I would say it
is per City so mightbe I could say
average sales
and then I could say by city or by ear
or I would want to look into a
particular year if we have the order
date so we can say greater than a
particular order date so we would want
how our sales have got affected after a
particular date and that depends on the
situation so I can do that and here I
can say greater than
order date now for that obviously we
have to use the operator and then I
would want to calculate so I can
basically say
calculate now this is what I would want
to find out so I can say calculate and
then in calculate I can say let's take
the colum which we are interested in so
we can pass in something like a measure
me here so for example I can just say
average sales this is what I want but I
will give a separator here to filter out
the data and then I am going to use my
order
date for example I can basically say
let's take
orders and in that I am taking order
date and then basically this order date
has to be greater than or lesser than
something so here you are specifying
your data set your table and the column
you are giving a filter here and that's
basically your Dax expression so your
Dax has different functions so when we
talk about these functions like as I
said you are going for average or you're
going to calculate something so you have
what we uh usually mean or we use is
your predefined formulas now that can
perform calculations by using specific
values called arguments so which are in
particular order and structure so always
remember that when you talk about Dax
this always refers a complete column or
a table now there are different
categories of functions which we can
work on so you have date and time such
as date difference or finding out now or
finding out a later time you can use
something like time intelligence which
is dates between first date and last
date you can go for information
functions which contains custom data you
can have logical functions mathematical
functions statistical functions uh text
functions you have uh basically working
on parent child relationship so there
are different function categories which
can be used and as I said we can go for
creating a new column or a new measure
and we can use this Dax for our data
analysis now let's see how we do that so
say for example I have my order date now
I would want to work on this so let's
select say for example go to your data
set and you have lot of data here so you
can basically go for all this data here
which shows me complete information of
the different columns and you can choose
which columns you are interested in
which columns might be you would want to
cut short so for example I have order ID
I have row ID mightbe I don't want a row
ID so I can choose if I want to delete
this and you can say okay I would want
to delete this now these are some
changes which you are applying and now
if you see there is
no uh row ID what we see here as a field
you start with your
order ID you have your category you have
your order date
shipment and here you have your
segment and for example we have country
region Market category subcategory
product name sales and then you have
your Quant quanti discount profit and
all of this now what we can do is I can
basically add something here so this is
the data which we have and what we can
do is we can continue working on
this so let's click on home and here you
have ways to transform the data you have
a new measure you have quick measure you
have new column and you can try out
these so for example I can go into new
column and that basically says okay what
is your column called now I can say for
example as I was explaining let's go for
average sales so let's call it average
sales now that's what I'm interested in
now I need to use an internal function
so let's type in AV and that shows me
okay so there is an inbuilt function
called average we can use this one
so you can just hit on enter and now it
says okay which is the data set you're
interested in now based on the reports
based on the data sets I've used earlier
it shows me options of different tables
what we have or different data sets what
we have so let's choose orders so this
is what I'm interested in you can go for
double click and that gets selected and
now it says okay you want average on
sales but which is the column which you
would want to use so we can go for
category we can go for Country we can go
for customer ID all of these are your
different columns so for example I can
go for something like country and that
basically gets selected now I can
complete this by just closing the
parenthesis and that's basically my dags
function so so my D function is ready
and if you want you can add details to
it so if you would want to continue your
function you can always do a shift enter
that takes you to the next line if you
do not want it you can go back you can
add a comment by saying alt shift and
letter a and then you can say my first
Dax function and you can give in some
information depending on what kind of
function function you are creating and
that basically allows you to create the
function so this is done now let's hit
on enter and basically it will say the
function average cannot work with values
of type string and and that's right I
mean we basically chose the wrong
country I mean you cannot have an
average on Country so that's not right I
should use something where I have to
take a numeric value so for example
example I will replace this so I will
say I want average sales and here I can
choose what should I take so for example
let's go for sales and that's what I
would want so it says order sales and
then hit on enter and it basically has
populated my new column but then it is
basically taking average sales and it
has taken average sales overall now we
have not we have just selected a column
we have not given any filter so it just
gives me average and it populates every
row with this one now this is fine that
we have added a column it has the same
average value and that basically gives
me sales on average so as I said your
Dax function always references a
complete call colum or a complete table
and then basically it adds the value now
let's see how we can use this if you
notice the field or the column has got
added here let's get into
visualization and what I can do is I can
basically choose one of the type of
visualizations so for example if I
choose this and say for example I would
be adding this average sales and that is
the data I would want to look into so
what we can do is we can just say okay
I'm interested in this average sales it
shows me the function and we can add it
here now this is just giving me the
average sales overall now that really
doesn't make sense let's look at this
one or plotted graph so it gives me what
is the average sales and it gives me
some visualization so we can create
visualization like this based on our
column now what we can also do is we can
go back to our data and we can go for
different functions so as I said you can
create a function that adds a column now
let's go for something else so I will
say average sales and I would be
interested in say a particular
product now we have average sales and
that is the measure which we can use so
for example I would want to find
out
um wherein the year or let's look at the
date field here so for example we have
country as
France it is telling me City it is
giving me customer name it gives me a
segment so let's choose a different
field and we can filter by that so for
for example I'll say average sales bu or
whatever name you want to give let's say
segment now what I will do here is
instead of using this
average so I will go for something like
calculate now I can go for calculate I
can go for concatenate so let's go for
calculate and we know that we have a
particular column so let's go for this
one which is
let's open up a bracket here so let's go
here let's give
our column name so that could be your
average sales so let's look at what was
the column name and we have average
sales with a SS Capital so let's go for
average and then let's go for sales now
this is what I want to do but on what so
let's choose this and here I'm going to
now
[Music]
choose orders so and then we have to
basically look at the column which has
the segment value so segment now this is
what I would want to use and then we can
try giving a value to this so you have
segment as corporate so for example
let's say let's go
for so it says calculate given
expression which we have already given
that's your average sales or we can
basically give the expression what we
did earlier and then you go for a
filtering value so I'm saying order
segment and let's go for something like
corporate now that going to be my
segment let's close this one so here's
the example exle what you do is you give
your measure name so that says average
sales by segment you can do a calculate
now here you have to pass in a measure
so for example I'm saying average and
I'm saying take an average for sales
that is give me an average value of
sales but what I'm interested in is when
the order segment is corporate
so I'm giving a filter here and then it
gives me average sales by segment so
that's the column value here and it is
basically filtering out based on the
segment being corporate so segment is
our particular column here which is
showing up
somewhere let me see where is my segment
column so we have your
product now I have
uh let's search
for Country City postal code customer ID
and since we have chosen order sales it
is giving me this average value and you
can choose a different column or you can
just say profit is greater than
something else so I would be only
interested in those values and you can
continue adding things to your tax
expression
and this is how you can do here so
basically what I did was we were using a
measure which is average order sales I
said my segment has to be corporate or
basically you can just say segment has
to exist so you can say a Boolean value
like equals true now I'm saying orders
profit has to be greater than 100 and
I'm only looking for my average sales by
segment where profit is is greater than
100 segment is Corporate and now this
has calculated the value so you
basically see here so it tells me 286 if
you look at the profit value so it is
greater than 100 what I can do is I can
even add a filter here so for example I
can say greater than and let's give some
value here so for example let's go for
100 and let's see if it has done the
work so you see all the average values
where it is greater than 100 and then we
have to also look at our other values we
can filter it so segment has to be
corporate and let's apply the filter
here so I will uncheck I'll say
corporate now this is what I'm
interested in so it tells me the
corporate is sector now you see the
sales value which is already showing up
here which we have we have average sales
by segment which is telling me that you
have corporate segment and it gives you
where the profit values are greater than
100 now we have this Dax here we have
applied we have the filter and what we
can do is we can go to quickly
visualization and what I can do is I can
choose this I can add it here and then
that says me aage sales by segment
however we can go for different kind of
visualization which can give us more
meaning here and look at the data so
this is how you can simply use your tax
Expressions now this is a simple quick
uh session where you are looking at the
Dax expression so when you look at this
symbol it means it is a Dax expression
so you can
obviously double click on this one and
that show shows you what is your tax
expression now as I said I have given
two filters here so always remember once
you have given a measure you give your
first filter and then you can give any
number of filters you can just order it
in a different line that should be fine
let's say average sales by
segment okay so let's say
average
sales by
segment okay
profit greater than 100 so I can give
some kind of name which basically
identifies my column and that gives me
the value now if you see here we have
applied these filters and that's why we
are only seeing the relevant data which
is profit which is a particular segment
and you can create any number of Dax
expressions like this using some inbu
functions so any time if you would want
to see if your Dax expression is working
fine what you can do is for example I
can say test
function okay now I would want to create
a function and then I can basically
choose the available functions as I said
you have logical functions you have
statistical functions you have
mathematical functions you have
information functions so you have all of
these options here and you you can
choose one of these so for example we
were going for average you have and and
or for example I can directly go for and
but that would not make sense in the
beginning you can go for absolute value
of something so for example let's choose
absolute and now I want to work on
orders so I go for orders and here I can
say okay I'm looking at orders but I
would be looking at sales value I I
would want the exact value so I can
choose this one right and here now once
I am creating a function so I can be
selecting a different column so this is
basically one column now you can add
calculation you want to do but this
basically says unexpected expression
because this is a new dag for a new
column so what I can do is I can take
this out from here I can go ahead and
create a new column and then or a new
measure so I can do that and it works
perfectly fine now I can save this and
we can call it whatever report you would
want to call so let's say super
store with new Dax and you can share it
you can publish it you can continue
using it in your reports so you can
create any number of functions as such
and then just save it so for example I
have set of Dax functions and I can
upload it on a GitHub link so here for
example if I go in here and if I click
on Dax so that tells me the different
kind of visualizations I have based on
the standard data so it depends on uh my
file which is which should be existing
here so I can go in here and this should
actually work but the location has
changed and I just click on open report
I can do a browse report I can go into
powerbi content and here let's look into
this one and just say open so that will
not only load the report it has
different visuals and uh different
visuals with the standard data set which
comes with Microsoft and it basically
has different kind of visuals and each
of those visuals again have different
tax functions so you can use these also
so what we have learned is working on a
store data set working on some thread
hunting data sets working on our own
created tables and these are some of the
pages what you see here so this is based
on the data which comes in with AWS and
you can always look into one of these
and you can search if you see here here
look at this icon and it tells me okay
this looks like a tag function and let's
double click on this one and that shows
me the function what you're doing so
you're creating a function called age it
uses State difference it works on dim
customer table on the birthday date and
you would want to basically find out the
date difference between now and the
birthday and you would want the year so
this is the data what you have you can
obviously choose this you can look at
the result of this and you can see the
visuals so these are some simple tax
Expressions you can create lot of data
expressions like this now this
is here you have date function so I can
choose which are the Dax functions which
are existing here I can just load them
so for example this one is one of my
other data sets and then you can play
around with the data here so this is how
you create your Dax expressions and this
is just this was just a quick demo on
going for some simple Dax Expressions
you can create different kind of visuals
and you can then save those reports you
can publish it to powerbi service and
and you can then gather insights based
on this so this is how you work with
powerbi wherein uh you can use Dax you
can use powerbi service to gather
insights you can use desktop to work on
loading your data transforming your data
in different ways and then basically
analyzing it so these days you might be
hearing a lot about PBI we do have a lot
of bi tools in the market like Excel
Tablo click view a lot but people are
talking about powerbi the most but why
so we will be knowing that in a while so
let's get started with uh building a
dashboard first and eventually in the
process you will definitely understand
it so making a dashboard in powerbi is
just like a breeze so before we get
started with powerbi I would like to
explain you a few fundamentals that you
might want to take a look at before
getting started so data cleaning is a
much needed process so you can do data
cleaning using public query or you can
just simply open your Excel and try to
check the data types for blank cells any
inappropriate datas eliminating them
right so simple basic fundamental data
cleaning process if you have some
irrelevant data in your data set just
eliminate that row or try to fill that
with the proper data that was supposed
to be there and if there are any blank
rows or blank cells eliminate those
blank rows and blank cells so that your
data is up to date and accurate and
apart from that uh let's check out some
data types for example the first one
which happens to be the r ID here so
this is the data set that we will be
dealing with today so this particular
Road ID has a general data type so it
can be either a number or a float and
when you come to the ship date over here
the order date over here right so those
are date data types and they might
follow different formatting let's say
they might follow uh date number that is
day number and for month they might add
the alphabetical name like Jan or Feb
and the year or a few others might
format with date time and uh you know we
will be having date uh and at the time
which will be describing the hours
minutes and seconds right so there are a
lot of variations where a data from date
data type can be saved so it's your
fundamental you know responsibility to
make sure that all the elements from a
specific column are of one single data
type so that the the entire data set is
integ you know it's very uh good and it
should be intact that's the whole point
of it and if you have any
inconsistencies in your data set that
might result in you know abnormal
predictions abnormal dashboards or
charts whatever you make there will not
be uh those dashboards cannot be relied
on your reports cannot be uh reliable so
that's the whole point of it so just
make sure that you go through the
fundamental very basic data cleaning
things like eliminating blank rows blank
cells maintaining a uniform data type
for all your columns you know based on
the data it's not like you have to
maintain character data type for your
dates so you need to make sure that what
kind of data type suits what kind of
data and you need to check that and make
sure that all the elements in that
particular column follow one standard
data type so I'll be going with date
data type for audit date and ship date
and ship mode will be character serial
that is row number will be serial number
or row number will be integer and uh
everything else will be C data type and
when it comes to the last four rows
sales quantity discount and profit so
those will be the uh you know float data
type and when you check out the location
here we have country not so these will
be segregated by your bi tool either
Tablo or powerbi whichever you're using
so those will be segregating these
particular location type data types and
it will show them as map right so this
is the major thing which you need to
make sure before starting with your you
know building the dashboard so that you
know having said that let's begin with
the powerbi let me start the powerbi bi
tool here it is just click on it it
should take a while so here we are we
are on the you know first page of the
powerbi so you can import the data from
Excel you can import the data from SQL
Server you can just copy paste your
blank tables so you can make use of some
apis and plugins and get connected to
the data sources from web or any other
sources and you can also import the data
from that particular source so today we
will be dealing with the Excel data set
so we will be importing the Excel file
and before that here you can see some
options which are filters data
visualizations and uh data so we have't
loaded ready so you can see the data
over here and if you are on table they
will be available on the left side and
you will call them dimensions and
measures so you can apply the same uh
analogy here so you'll be available with
the dimensions and measures once we
import the data and here you have a wide
variety of charts and graphs that you
can just you know drag and drop and
create so once you have the data over
here you can just drag and drop onto the
canvas over here and then it will
automatically generate some type of a
data set or chart let's say it'll give
you a tabular chart you can just click
that particular chart and come over here
over over here and you can select any
one of the charts available here let's
say you wanted the P chart you can do
that uh you can do a donut chart you can
do dream app right so once you h on to
it it will tell the name of that
particular chart and you can select that
like it's based on your choice right so
this is about it basically now I can
also do some drill through that's again
for a session in another time another
day so that's session for a different
day for now let's try to create um
dashboard in a routine way remember I'm
telling you or I'm specifying in a
routine way because we also about to
learn why powerbi is being uh so popular
currently in the bi industry right so
there are some tips and tricks that will
help you in the long term so let me
close the filters close the
visualizations close the data and now
let's let's click on this particular
option which says import data from Excel
right now we are in the Excel data set
so this is the file where I basically
store my Excel data sets that I'll be
working on so you can also have access
to this you can just let me know and we
will drop down the tribe Link in the
description box and you'll have the
accessibility to all these data sets so
remember I spoke about data clearing
right so this Excel data it is
completely cleaned every data column has
a uniform data type and it follows that
data type throughout and if you check
out this particular original data set
which is sales European sales over here
so this is the original data set which
follows different nomenclatures for data
types for example if I come down to the
date column there are different types of
data types some of the cells have only
dates they follow date month and year
and some of these cells have date month
and year along with the time time so
another glitch here so a few of the
cells were following the uh you know
24hour timing nomenclature and a few
others were following 12 hours that is
specifically mentioning AM and PM right
so this causes a lot of trouble when you
creating a report trust me I've been
there so what I did is I clean the
entire data set removed the cells I mean
the blank cells remove the blank columns
remove the blank cells remove the blank
row
and in any situation if there is um you
know uh discrepancy followed in data
types I also cleared that and I saved it
as Excel data right so we will be using
this particular data now and if you need
these data sets I can provide you with
that using the Drive Link and you can
have access you can also try your data
cleaning by following our tutorial which
is linked in the description box below
for data cleaning and you can do it and
you can start with your dashboards now
let me just extract this particular dat
set just click on open and you will be
having it on the screen just in a moment
so when you check out the original D set
we have a lot of sheets here right so
these were some pivot tables that we
created for data analytics using Excel
so you can also check out that video now
we will be doing the same data analytics
and creating an entire interactive
dashboard on PBI with the same data set
so you can see uh powerbi is trying to
load all the tables and all the sheets
available in that particular file but we
just need one out of those you can also
click all of those or you can just cck
get one out of those so for now I just
need one out of those so here it is and
you can check the data you can have a
quick preview of how your data is
looking right and then just click on
load and the best part is powerbi will
also perform a data cleaning operation
from its end and identifies if there are
any rules or any SS that I missed out to
clean and it will notify you if there
are any errors and it will also I mean
it is also capable to you know uh fix
those errors for you you can see I have
seven errors right so you can just view
errors and clear them or I can just
close so that in the background PBI will
take care of them for me now we have the
data right so here you can see the data
tab got opened and here you can have a
new drop down if you click on that you
have all the data elements presented the
data set or in terms of T you have
dimensions and measures so basically
wherever you have a sumission or any
kind of mathematical operation present
in front of the column name that
particular element or that particular
column is considered to be the measure
so which is which is basically dealing
with the numbers and all the others
which do not have any other mathematical
symbol like equals hashtag or sumission
those are the dimensions B basically the
character data type or the date data
type whichever uh the data type it is
but not numbers right so here we have it
so what do you basically do is
completely similar to uh Tablo click
view or any other business intelligence
tool basically just drag and drop right
now let's say I want to find out the um
region wise sales what can I do here is
I can just drag it onto the canvas and
again I have sales over here I can drag
sales to the canvas I can just you know
H it onto the existing box you can see
this particular box right you can just
drop it inside the box so that powerbi
will understand that I'm trying to uh
you know extract the region wise sales
and it will perform the sumission of all
the sales region wise and it'll give you
a table let's say you're not satisfied
with this particular table
representation you can just hold your
table and here you can open the
visualizations and open the filters
right and here you have visualizations
over here if you want to segregate that
in form of a py chart you can do it
right now it will give you the sum of
sales based by region now want to
calculate the uh let's say audit date
you know uh date wise sales then I can
also do that you can just drag the sales
over here and select that particular
table and you know whenever you are
dealing with date data typ type right
when you're dealing with dat data type
then what you do is you try to use the
line cop it's the best way to represent
your sales how they are happening right
and uh few other things let's say I want
to calculate uh the profit by city or
country which country is facing the
highest number of profits we can also do
that just drag and drop you know how it
is and okay it's giving a lot of
countries but but still it's not a big
problem for us can just drag and drop
the sales and and here you can select
any one out of these let's go with the
bar graph and here you have it right now
so for so good right so far we so good
now if you um worry about the
interactivity you don't have to
basically when you're using Excel or any
other table let's say if you're using
Excel you might have to use slices right
so if you're not aware of what am I
talking about you can just go check the
data analytics of building the dashboard
using Excel where I have completely
explained the day data set and we have
you know built an interactive dashboard
there so it'll give you a better idea
about it so before that um let's get my
let's Circle back so here uh you don't
have to create a slicer and you don't
have to report the connections between
each and every chart it's automatically
done in the background for example let's
say if I wanted to calculate the sales
of central region if I just click on the
central region it will automatically
change the display of the entire
dashboard and it'll give me the central
region sales right and uh if I just go
back it'll you know it'll give me the
entire sales dashboard let's say if I
want to calculate the west region I have
my best data right so that's the best
part of powerbi and now we are going to
identify why this this is one good
reason why powerbi is popular but there
is another good reason why powerbi is so
popular right now so popular so easy and
so effective that even a schoolgoing kid
can build a dashboard trust me a
schoolgoing kid of grade 11 grade 12 or
a candidate who is just graduating or a
fresher or any person who doesn't have a
computer knowledge but has some good
knowledge about numbers and how
businesses work they can definitely
create an interactive dashboard using
powerbi even if they are new to powerbi
so we are going to just see just that
let's create create a new page or you
can just go back to the same
page okay let's create a new page now
let's say I don't know uh how to create
a chart I don't know let's say my
manager asked me to create a complete
report of the sales happening and I
don't know PBI and I don't know anything
about how to create a chart and how it's
work right but I have certain idea right
let's say I have a certain idea I want
to find out the region wise sales I want
to find out the country-wise sales I
want to find out the performance of
sales date on date year on year month on
month quarter on quarter whatever it is
you just want to create you know you
just want to extract the you want to
build an Insight on the date wise sales
and uh you want to find out um you know
profits based on certain regions or
certain categories right which category
is the highest performing category
which is the majorly used shipment mode
right there are Limitless possibilities
you know what to build but you don't
know how to build right in such
situations powerbi is here for the
rescue just right click on the canvas
just click anywhere right now you okay
it was not the right click it was the
double click so just double click
anywhere on the powerb canvas and there
you can see something called ask a
question about your data let me expand
that for you you can see ask question
anything about your data now let's say I
want to create the same region wise
sales right you can just type on the
region wise sales and it's already
giving you a uh you know it's already
giving you a bar graph now let's say you
don't want the bar graph you want a p
pie chart or a donut graph right donut
chart so you can either select any one
of this I'll go with the pie chart for
now so you can just select on that and
here you have your pie chart right how
simple is that how easy is that right
and now you can just place it anywhere
on your dashboard check the size
alignment and you're good to go let's
close these filters for now so that the
canvas is a little more better visible
now let's say I want to find out ship
Moree profits and uh the type of graph
I'll go with the bar graph there you go
sales that happened using a certain ship
mode and you have the data right here
and I'm choosing the bar graph now let's
say I want to calculate the month on
month sales right so double click
anywhere on the canvas
sales audit date and
remember we want to represent the okay
it's too intelligent
it already gave you a line graph right
just click that select that and uh just
place it anywhere on your chart and you
can expand it there you go there you
have it right and now let's do let's try
to find out a few more things let's try
to find out uh which of these segments
gave me a lot of profits category wise
profits category profit and let's try to
build uh we have a pie chart so let's
build a donut chart there you go place
it anywhere on the canvas like whever
you need it now few more things state
wise okay now let's make it a little
more
interesting State fail map you wanted a
map right so just select on that and you
will be having the map okay some problem
here so I think let's go with
country see sales map okay let's enter
now let's select this particular chart
okay no interactivity I need right now
select this and here let's select map
and map and fi map visuals are disabled
to enable them go to a file options
settings options Global Security details
okay let's try this file options and
settings options global global security
use map and fi map visuals I think this
should uh fix this okay let's refresh it
should help us there you go you have
your map let's place it anywhere in r in
the dashboard now we have the region
wise sales or country-wise sales and
shipment mode subcategory and uh let me
know what else we can build let's have
the kpis here now let's go to the sales
and just drag and drop the sales sign
anywhere on the
table and I want the data presented in
visuals I have the card now let's have
profits and that should be a card again
and let's have U quantity that should be
a card again that's our kpi profit sales
quantity discount is another one where
which you can add and just add number
card again there you go we can go to the
insert option and so text box and there
you can just write down sales dashboard
align the text to Center and that should
be good there you go so far so good and
in case if you wanted to add a few more
visual athetics to your dashboard you
can also do that you can just click down
here I think you remember your
PowerPoint right just go to view and you
can select any of the backgrounds you
want and there you go you have it if
you're not happy with this you can also
have some images in the background you
can add some images
which will make it look a little more
interactive right so that's how you
build an amazing interactive dashboard
in powerbi and uh that's the reason why
uh the Simplicity why powerbi is being
so popular amongst the old other
remaining bi tools and now let's get
started with the customer analytics
dashboard using powerbi so we will be
using the Amazon sales statuses from
2023 and 2024 for this particular
dashboard using powerp so let's quickly
switch between the PowerPoint
presentation and the DAT set that we are
going to use today so this particular
data set is available on kagle and it is
actually the data set between 2020 and
2021 so we carried out a little bit of
data cleaning process and we enhanced
the data set like removing the blank
spaces removing the blank cells and the
blank rows basically so and after that
changing the data type of dates so you
might be wondering there might be a few
discrepan in the way the data is
formatted because there are many ways
for example if I just select this column
and go back to data type and if I go to
the available dates there are many
formats so you can see year month and
date date month and year and there is an
alphabetical representation of month
right so there are many variations where
you can represent the date so we are
going to use one sing format for the
entire data set so that it can be easier
for us to identify the week on week
month on month quarter on quarter and
yearly uh analysis so that's the whole
point of it first point just try to
eliminate any kind of blank cells rows
or columns in your data set so that the
accuracy of the data that you are using
to perform analysis is intact and good
right so apart from that just check if
you want to eliminate any of the decimal
points just select this and here you can
see the option to element leading
decimal numbers right you can use this
option over here so there are about 2
lh86 393 rows in this particular data
set so it might take a little while to
uh reflect my actions on this particular
data set and apart from that if you
could just hover over through this
particular data set you have a lot of
things to deal with you have regions you
have username discount percentage and uh
you have have first name last name of
the user quantity order price value so
why are we basically going through this
particular D set is it is when you
understand it is when you can quantify
what's happening with the D set that's
when you can plan out what kind of
analysis you want to perform right let's
say you did not get any kind of prere
reques from your manager you just have
the DS head and you need to perform the
exact uh you know analysis which could
benefit your organization so they also
want some Insight so that they can make
out some decisions out of it right some
business decisions so in that situation
you just have to go through the D set
once and do the data cleaning process
and then understand what exactly has
been mentioned in this particular data
set and what kind of uh insights you can
extract out of this data set and you can
proceed with that so basically we have
quantity ordered price value and uh
total apart from that you have category
you have different payment methods you
have uh the year you have the dates and
uh you so when you have dates you can
also create some trend lines out of it
and apart from that um let's say you
have zip codes region right so you can
find up region wise sales and a few more
things what you can basically do out of
it right so having the data set
understood let's go back to powerbi so
this is our powerbi platform so
basically just select this particular
Excel workp option and for the data I've
done it basically here you have it so we
have the age category City Country
everything presented over here now let's
quickly create
the visualizations using this particular
so I would firstly go with u a bar graph
okay let me choose this uh bar graph
right over here and uh let me
create gender wise sales let's let's
have the
gender
here we should be having something
called as a price or a sale so we have
price over here you can quickly draw and
drag this and drop it on the
x-axis okay we y axis and uh gender on
the
x-axis so we don't want this filter over
here you can eliminate
this so now you have um gender wise
sales right now next let's use a pie
chart now you can find out the region
why sales quickly add the region
into Legends
here you have the region by sales so you
have Midwest Northeast South and
southwest regions so these are the Sal
number uh line gra which can help us to
do okay so just click on the canvas and
then double click for your draft sheet
now let's use the audit
date and drop it onto
xais and
um rise on to Y
AIS now if you could uh use the drop
down and use the date hierarchies you
can use the year on year month on month
so let's go with month on Mon or quarter
okay let's go with quarter on quarter
now you can see how are the sales
running quarter on quarter in the for
this particular data set so we have two
years that is 2020 and I mean yeah 2023
and 2024 the quarter on quarter
comparison for year on-ear sales figures
right now let's click on the canvas once
again and now you can choose the over
here and uh so since we
have two genders and I think we also
have a
for age it should be somewhere in the
list so basically you can derive what
age groups have made the maximum number
of sales
right yeah so here we have
it and the sales so basically it'll
create a bucket right uh age group from
18 age group from 19 20 21 and so on now
just go through the ERS or you can go
with the price so just drag and drop it
in values and you have it here and you
created a donor chart of it and uh let's
try to create a field map now uh you can
understand which uh area or which region
was the highest uh sales uh we received
so just go through the data set over
here so we have the country just drag
and drop the the country and then have
the price or orders you can use anything
okay let's go with the
orders quantity
order and add it in the
values so here we have it so if you
could expand you can find out which
region was the one which giv us highest
number of
orders and there is another simple way
to do it as well if you just double
click on the
[Music]
canvas it will give you a prompt where
you can write
map country
wise map okay map state so we have a
state column here sales or
price and uh it will automatically
understand your query and create a
map which will show you the highest
number of sales from the regions or the
region or statewise sales brilliant now
if we proceed into the final chart okay
we have a waterfall chart so now you can
create a waterfall chart so you just
name it
waterfall so we have uh category
somewhere yeah forall category wise just
enter price or sale and we have a
waterfall chart over here based on the
categories you can just drag or you can
expand the canvas to have a clear
picture and uh yeah so far we have dealt
with okay we have a scatter plot we can
do a scatter
plot scatter plot for quantity of orders
received against discount offered
so we should be having quantity ordered
ut5 against
discounts or I think we can go with
order idies so it'll give us a unique uh
representation they has been a small
discrepancy order ID or you can also go
with customer ID
against discount
offer so we have a huge data set 2 lakh
plus so it might take a little while to
respond to the requests that's
completely all right now what left out
is the kpi so you can also create some
kpis so just double tap and uh write a
kpi for total sales write a
kpi toal
ers 29,000
API for total
discount keep for discount
percentage or we can use kpi for gender
which can tell us how many number of uh
females or how many number of males did
create an order we will be having a
number
here Order
writing if you could just close these
visualizations over here we can expand
the canvas and you can also have okay we
can also minimize this particular area
and we can also
have another
chat or bar bar
graph for types of payments payment
types payment method right so we will be
generating a bar graph with highest
number of payment methods used that is
cash on delivery online payment emis Etc
so it will take a little time to reflect
on this particular screen that's all
right now if you can just go to view and
here you will be having various options
for representing your data set just
click on the best way to represent your
data set there you go so basically
that's how you create okay let's try to
rearrange our charts a little bit so
that the kpis and kras are clearly
visible
there you go so that's how you create a
customer analytics dashboard using
powerbi now powerbi can import data in
three different modes the first one is
import mode where you can just directly
connect to the source and import the
data in patch mode and another mode is
the direct query mode where the data the
real time data is already connected to
the powerbi dashboard and by just
refreshing the powerbi or the data you
can get the real time insights on the
data and the third one is the mix and
match of both import and direct query
mode you can also call it as a dual mode
or also as a composite mode so if you
want to know a little bit more detail in
these three modes you can just let us
know in the comment section below and we
will have a complete tutorial covered
for that right now we will get started
with the types of data importing using
PP so you can import data in different
ways it may be from files it may be from
an Excel document it may be from a
website it may be from SQL or any other
database or it can also maybe from cloud
Etc right so we will be dealing with all
of those here and uh let's get started
so here we are on my PBI window now they
can be instances where you might have to
load data from one or more sources and
you might have to club that data
together now let's say I have U
continuous data from four to five
different years and we have a separate
workbook or Excel workbook for different
years right and in that situation let's
say you have a requirement where you
have to completely segregate all those
four five years of data into one single
file and import all that into your bi
and create your insights based on year-
on-ear performance or month-on-month
performance right so in a few situations
you might have your data in an Excel
source and another set of data in maybe
your database maybe in a website or
maybe in a different Source correct so
in those situations you might have to
collect all your data dump it into
powerbi and use data transformation and
data modeling in powerbi and create one
clean data set for you to perform your
analysis and extract some valuable
insights so that's a different tutorial
for a different day but to help you with
the fundamentals of data transformation
and data modeling we already have in
detail data transformation and data
modeling tutorials in powerbi but if you
want that all to be segregated into one
single tutorial you can let us know in
the comment section below and we will
have that done as well now let's proceed
with our data loading into powerbi the
first type we will go with importing
data from file right so you can just go
to the get data option over here and you
already have a lot of varieties but in
case if you are not getting the one
you're looking for you can just click on
more and you will have a set of options
readily available on your screen like
this one now here you can see some more
options so here I have have a file
option over here you can just click on
file or a folder over here and now it
will directly navigate you to the file
system of your computer just double
click on that and here you will have the
browse option just click on browse and
remember where you have your file so I
have it in my downloads and here I have
Excel and just press okay and now your
data has been successfully loaded onto
your public will be I window now here
you can you can just click on load to
load data or in case you find it so here
we have a four different years just as
we discussed in the beginning the data
of sales from the last four years 2020
2021 2022 and 2023 so in such situations
you can just click on transform data and
transform your data and model your data
into one single Excel workbook and start
your analysis so if you just click on
load you can directly load the data onto
your powerbi window and this is one way
of doing
it uh see your data yes there you go the
data has got successfully loaded you can
just directly select the data that you
want that you working with and you can
have it here and now let's proceed with
the second way of loading data so I'll
you know and name this file as I name
this workbook as file load data from
file right and now let's create a new
page or new uh workbook where we will
load data from an Excel
file right so here you can just click on
Excel workbook option directly over here
or you can also go with the same get
data option we'll go with Excel workbook
you can see it has directly redirected
me to the place where I have my Excel
Excel files so you can just click on
Excel data that we working on and press
open and shortly you can see the Excel
files getting loaded over here and now
you can have the option of choosing what
table you want to load right there are
possibilities where one Excel workbook
might have multiple sheets but for now
our Excel data has only one sheet which
is named as data you can just click on
it and have a brilliant preview of your
data can check for any of the errors let
me remind you if in case if you have
some data cleaning to be done on your
data powerbi will automatically open
power query window for you where you can
run all your data cleaning operations
and each and every step you are
investing or you are making while
creating the data cleaning process or
while you're going through the data
cleaning process and you can manually
you can eliminate the ual task and you
can save all the steps and you can
automate your data cleaning process and
powerbi will automate that process and
clean every single cell of your data set
and your data will be ready for
extracting insights now this is another
way of uh you know importing or loading
data into powerbi window from Excel
files can just directly load or in case
if you want to transform can just click
on transform data and the powerbi window
will get redirected to a power query
window you can you know clean your data
and load it so this is the second way of
doing or loading your data is a problem
you can just view and clear those errors
manually that's one way of doing it and
I'll just close it for now and let's
focus on loading data from a different
source so now we have so far loaded data
from a file loaded data from an Excel
file now another way is load
data from a website
so before we move ahead let's have a
look on the website that we are
selecting for
today so uh we selecting the world
population website you can see this
particular website is running real time
so it's giving us the calculations in
real time right so you can also load the
real time streaming data onto powerbi so
all you have to do is just select the or
you know copy the URL over here this is
present right here and uh just go back
to powerbi window and here you have the
options so take the option of web and
now it will ask for the URL you can just
you paste the URL and just you select
the basic or if you have some advanced
settings you can also have the advanced
parameters mentioned for PBI so I'll go
with the basic ones here and if you in
case if you want to also explore the
advanced set settings please do let us
know so that we can create an exclusive
tutorial for loading data from website
using advanced settings so it's a longer
tutorial so you do let us know so that
we can create an exclusive tutorial for
that now just press okay and your data
should be loaded just Connect Now a
preview of the data will be loaded onto
your screen you can just select the
table that you want right so we have
multip if we just go back to the website
right so you have multiple tables here
so the first table it will recognize
this particular part of data as a table
and apart from that here it has top 20
largest countries by population like as
a table and uh any other tabular data
present on the website see this one it
will also be considered as a table so
you can select any one of the tables you
want and load that data on to cover VI
now let's select anyone I think you
might have a preview here it's still
loading so there you go so we have
multiple tables here so you can just
select the table and have a preview and
see if that's the table that you wanted
to import and if you find the table that
you're looking for you can just click on
the load or transform data in case if
you want to do any data cleaning you can
just click the option of data transform
and do that and if you are happy
with the data that you have on your
preview then you can just select the
option of load the data so I think this
is the table I'm looking for you can
just click on load data and that will be
directly loaded onto your public
platform and it will be ready for your
analysis and extraction of insights
might take a little while but that's
okay there was some error it was not
found let's discard and try to get that
once
again now we have the preview of the
data now let's directly load it there
you go there we have our table number 12
directly load so here you can see
correct this is how you can load data
from a website and now let's explore
another one where we can load data from
either a cloud or a database correct now
here we as load
data from
database so there are multiple databases
available you can load data from a SQL
Server you can load data from uh MySQL
workbench you can load data from PHP my
admin which is proposed for SQL you can
load the data from Microsoft SQL server
and data ver and also from the cloud
sources all you have to do is just add
the server ID and any credentials like
the username password Etc and the data
will be loaded now let's try to load
data from a myql workbench or myql
database so you can just click on more
and here you can
type my
SQL database there you go and just
connect if you are connecting uh you
know uh for the first time it will ask
for
the server ID and databas so we will go
with the Local Host over here so the
address for Local Host as
127.0 do0 do okay let's quickly check
our boat number from the my SQL
workbench so my port number is
3308 and 3306 let's work with
3308 1
3308 don't forget the double colon over
here this one it's very important and uh
if we just dive deep into this
particular database we have different
databases SLP system well if you just
click on SLP we have so many tables so
let's go with SLP I type in SLP and
press on okay so it might also ask for
uh user ID and password so my user ID
and password are root and just PBI at
rate1 123 so everyone could have their
own passwords correct so you might have
a username dedicated username and
dedicated uh password just use that so
I've already logged in here so it just
gave me direct approval to navigator in
case if you're using this for the first
time you will just have um username and
password request on your screen you can
just type it down and and press okay so
here we have uh book selection table and
few other things book owner order
employee details employee register so
I'll just go with employee details this
is the one just load a transform data if
you are happy with the data preview you
have just load the direct data directly
and um yeah it should be loaded shortly
there you go so simply learn employee
details this is just uh simp simple
small data set that I have personally
created and you can load it onto the vi
and start your analysis so um in case if
you're working with Cloud the same you
just have to enter the details from
cloud and that's how you can do it and
in case if you're looking for an
exclusive tutorial on how to load data
from Cloud to powerbi please do let us
know and we'll have it done for you okay
let's switch to powerp first let's deal
with the type of sources and then switch
to excel so now uh we have landed to the
powerbi desktop so here we have a wide
variety of options Excel workbook you
can get the data from hubs you can get
data from SQL servers and you can also
enter the data manually we have another
option called Data verse it's it's
another story for another day and you
can also customize your inputs here you
can get some data from web pages you can
do some uh data C you know website
crawling and get the data so apart from
that coming back to today's uh subject
which is about importing data from an
Excel sheet so Excel can be a little
tricky sometimes so here we can see an
Excel data file so here we have sales
data for four years 2020 21 22 23 and uh
let's say we wanted to import all these
four files into one desktop powerbi
desktop can you do that yes we can do
that and another way here we have is
Excel data sets and and a combined Excel
sheet where we have multiple tabs the
same four years of data which looks
something like this 2020 21 22 and 23
correct so four years of uh data
separated by four different tabs so can
you combine this yes we can also combine
that so we will check out two
possibilities so let's quickly go back
to powerbi window and go to get data and
here we'll try the first one so going to
more and here select uh the folder
option so
file
and connect now browse the folder so we
have the browse option here go to
downloads where we have that folder go
to excel select that and press
okay and another okay and we should be
getting the data
shortly now uh here we have combine load
and transform you can just go with
combine and load but we don't want to
have any errors in our data sets so for
saf as side we will go to transform data
and we will shape our data manually and
for more tutorials on explanation on
transform data we have a exclusive a
video on transform data and prob you can
check out that so here go to the first
one you know the binary one where you
have the binary just right click it and
make sure that you remove any other
columns than binary we don't want them
right so uh an extra column is the c
custom column and here you go and let
the name be custom name need the name
for that so Excel we need a function
where we can import Excel workbook so
this is the one Excel workbook and open
a bracket then just double click on this
content or you can use insert close the
bracket and just press okay then you go
now you have the table over here you can
just expand it
so this prefix
okay now again just select the name of
the sheet and of the sheet rest
everything you can delete we don't need
any of
those you have it now expand the
data you can use the original columns as
prefix or not I will not choose to do
that press okay and your data should be
loaded shortly you can see we don't have
the names of The Columns as the column
headers you find them in the First
Column I in the first row you can okay
let's remove this column we don't need
the name column we need the row ID first
there you go now you can click on this
option over here where you can find a
small table and second option use first
R headers and that's how you get the
data imported from all the different
sheets into your data set you can once
check the
filters just make just to make sure that
we don't have any of the column headers
from four different dat sets as one of
the element right so we don't have it so
okay now this is one way of importing
data and another one let's say go back
to home and we wanted to import few more
data sets uh like the other one where we
have the combined one right so you have
the applied steps right you can just go
go on eliminating them just for demo
purposes so that we go back to the
homepage where we didn't have any of the
data set right now let's go back to the
source level we can also run the source
level over here so you can even close
the source level and close the query
settings so
data or we can completely C close the
power query edit yes
now let's import the Excel so this might
take a little while worry
not go to excel Excel workbook and here
just select the Excel data sets and here
we have the combined data set remember
where we had four different tabs so
press
okay automatically it will give us the
power uh query option where we can load
or transform the data now you have four
different tabs now powerbi or power
query will give you an option of
choosing which particular years you want
to work with let's say I want to work
with only the latest two years that is
2022 and 2023 then I can directly go to
load or transform let's go with
transform as we did previously and here
you can combine the data sets all
together you can just uh use the
uh data merging option and combine these
two data sets so here we have the merge
queries option and you can just
merge here we have the first table which
is 2023 here you just have to select
2022 from the
dropdown the data here and just press on
okay and you will have the data sets
merch for more explanation on how to
merch data in powerbi we have a
dedicated tutorial on how to use merge
in PBI and that's how you can import
data to power Pi now what exactly is
data modeling so most of the times your
data might be from different sources
let's say one of your team member
prefers to use Microsoft Excel and
another one prefers to use a relation
database and sometimes you might have to
take care about the realtime streaming
data from your company's websites like
maybe the traffic for today current
traffic current number of leads current
number of applications submitted Revenue
cost Bel Etc right so this data comes
from different sources and you being a
data analyst should be able to segregate
all the data collect all the data filter
it and create one single module to
perform your analysis right so the
process of collecting data from
different sources segregating it and
trying to relate them to one another is
process called as data modeling in
public Pi now data modeling is done with
the help of power pivot is also
available in Microsoft Excel maybe since
it least more than decade right so the
same powerp is also used in power pii
now to understand more on that let's go
ahead before we get into Power pivot and
understand all the technicalities let's
understand some theoretical answers now
modeling can be done in two ways first
one is the dimensional modeling which is
currently used used in most of the
business intelligence tools and another
one is the relationship model which we
have seen since ages where we use an
normal relational database where we
create some foreign Keys some primary
keys and try to relate one table to
another based on the foreign key and
primary now let's go ahead with the
dimensional module first so what exactly
is a dimensional table you ask so
dimensional table is one of the set of
companion tables to a fact table so
let's say the center table which you
have here sales is the fact table so
sales data will basically have the
product ID order ID profit gained price
of the product quantity Etc right so
this particular table which is in the
central place which is called as the
fact table is connected to the store
which will have the details of the store
region location and another table which
has details about product another table
which has the details about dates
shipment date order date delivery date
and another table customer so all these
dimensional tables are connected to the
fact table right so customer so the fat
table is something which will not change
over time let's say on today's date on
current date you made a sale of $100 you
sold five to six products right it will
be the same even after you open the
database after an a it is not going to
change it is a fact it is a real data
right and when it comes to product there
might be changes in product ID there
might be changes in you know Min changes
not if not 100% change they might be
negligible changes they might be
negligible update something like that
maybe you are collecting customer first
name second name phone number and
address maybe tomorrow you might also
want to have an email ID added to it
maybe tomorrow you want to add some
specific you know customer IDs or custom
something you know some additional
things to your D Sal so that's the
difference between the regular table and
the fact table so this is how the
dimensional modeling is done when it
comes to the next type of modeling that
is the relationship model right so you
will be having one table and you will
try to connect to a different table
right both these tables are connected
based on a primary key and a foreign key
so the primary key in product table can
be the product ID right and when you go
into the next table which is product
type there you will be having maybe
category subcategory product name and
the category or the subcategory can act
as a primary key for product typ table
additionally there will be another
column on the name of product ID which
will become the foreign key for product
table and a primary key for product
table and you can connect product table
and product type table together using
these primary key and foreign key so the
SQL the people who know SQL might have a
better ID on this in case if you don't
have IDE on that we have a dedicated set
of tutorials in SQL and data loading so
you can have a look at that in the same
powerbi series now that we have a
detailed understanding of the types of
modeling in pobi or data modeling let's
proceed with the Rel relationships right
cardinality or the types of
relationships which you can establish
using the previous model which we
discussed which is this one dimension
model right so the cardinality or the
types of relationship what you can
expect is one to many many to many one
to one and many to one let's say we will
deal with the same sales data and
customer data right so in customer data
let's say we have 10 customers and in
the sales data we have the same 10
customers but 100 entries right so
customer number one maybe let's say
Harry Potter Harry Potter is your
customer and Harry Potter bought 10 WS
today and after a couple of weeks he
came back again and he bought 10 more
ones right so there is a multiple entry
here so many entries are related to one
entry which is in customer table right
such relationship is called as many one
to many and when it comes to many to
many then you might have another table
sales table and the products table right
where you have the product the wants
right so wants to customers that is many
to many and there is a specific wand
let's say Elder Wand and the user you
guessed it right it can be the last one
who holded the one so one to one that
kind of relationship ship is one to one
so remember we are using some movie
analogies so that it is easier for you
to understand and the last time one is
let's consider it as a slight
assessments to you so you tell me in the
comment section about what could be
many2 one so these are the types of data
modeling and cardinalities which you can
perform while data modeling now we will
understand this in a much better way
using a practical demonstration before
we move ahead using this directly on
powerbi let's understand power pivot how
exactly it works in Excel then you can
understand how it functions in powerbi
remember so power pivot power query one
and the same for both powerbi and
Microsoft Excel so powerbi is an
advanced version of Microsoft Excel
which has you can consider this way okay
which has some additional
functionalities of creating some vibrant
charts and ability to get connected to a
bigger higher Advanced versions of data
storage like Cloud Etc right so that's
how you can simplify the difference
between a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
and the Microsoft PBI product or the
business intelligence tool okay pretty
much so far so good now let's quickly
switch to Microsoft Excel so this is my
local storage and here we have some
Excel files so uh remember Microsoft
Excel or Microsoft power query or
Microsoft powerbi can load data from an
Excel worksheet a comma separated file
the same Excel file which is saved in
form of CSV it can take data from a PDF
it can take data from a website it can
take data from cloud so we have also
covered an exclusive tutorial on how to
load data onto a powerbi from various
sources the link can be found in the
description box below or let us know and
we will have it sent to you so we have
the same tutorial in our PP Series right
so here we are dealing with the
Microsoft Excel files so as discussed
before in the dimensional model we have
the fact table which is the sales data
and other all the dependent measures of
data where we have customers di you know
store locations product data region
sales Etc so we will also have this uh
data set or the file Linked In the
description box below should you want to
follow us in this demo you can download
the data and follow us in the
explanation process now let's go ahead
let me open sales data and let me also
open another data set which will have
customers data maybe let's try to open a
few more files so this is the customers
data and here we have um sales here we
have a product
could be store
locations so we have opened uh store
location sales team product data
customers data sales data and lastly the
regions data right so we have about six
files in it so we can you know load all
these six files onto PBI and you know so
here we have already created a data
model over here so before we directly
jump onto this we will understand how
exactly the power query and power P
Works in Excel so that you can apply the
same knowledge on powerbi for a better
understanding right now let's close this
we don't have anything to do with this
right now let's we deal with Microsoft
ex right so we have the sales data right
over here and uh the next let's say we
go with right so here we have a
different regions South West North right
so we don't have the region data in
sales table but what we have is sales
channels and uh audit dates shipment
dates Etc customer ID correct now let's
say I have a query I want to find out uh
how many number of sales happened
through this particular sales channel in
all the regions let's say I have east
west north south and I wanted to find
out how many number of wholesale sales
happened in east region how many number
of in store sales happened in west
region right so when you want to uh you
know do this you might want to run some
formulas or run some tools like building
a b table or maybe a vooka function
which is a little complicated to
understand right you might have to
create an entirely new table you might
want to pull pull the data from both the
tables using the lookup key the range
the exact match right the number column
number and the exact match or you know
approximate match it's a hectic task
right but when you know how a power
pivot or a pivot table power query works
then it's just like a BRI so let's
quickly uh maybe create a new workbook
and here we have paper pivot option
should you have a doubt how to activate
paper pivot it's really simple simple so
you just need to go to the file option
over here just click on file and go to
options enter and here you have an
option called addin click on addin and
here just go to excel addin com so you
you need to select the second one com
addin and go I have already included the
option so I have it over here in case if
it's not add I just click on Microsoft
power pivot for Excel and just okay you
will find it in the Rin right next to it
right so here you have it now before we
just directly dive into P pivot let's go
to home and try to load data so go to
data and get data from file so we are
working on Excel workbook so we'll take
Excel so we wanted to find out the
region wise SES correct so go to
downloads and here we have data modeling
inbi data sets and expand this a little
go to sales data and import now the
power query will be firing in the
background and it'll show you the
various uh tables it just had a look at
and select the table you want and now
instead of directly loading it go to the
option called load tool now it will give
you a new option where you don't have to
import the entire table but just create
a connection only and add this to the
data model check on that correct so so
these are the two steps only create
connection and add this data to the data
model press okay and so far so good the
sales data is getting loaded now let's
try to do that step once again and now
we will import a different table which
is Regions data import and there you go
select state regions load to and the new
box or new window where you will be
selecting only create a connction ction
and add this data to the data model okay
now the magic starts go to the power
pivot and select manage and here you
have some tables sales table and state
regions correct now you are not using
any V lookup X lookup hookup functions
you're not using any pivot tables you
are just clicking on the option called
pivot table that's all and a new pivot
table will be created right now you have
sales and regions select uh maybe the
region and go to the first table where
we had sales and maybe you can count the
order numbers that will also help you or
you can unit price unit so I'll go with
the number of sale we initially we
wanted to find the number of sales right
so you can just uh add the order number
okay remove this from here and from the
row we don't want and count so it has
has automatically taken the count over
here so you have the count so you
totally
have
okay Midwest so we have Midwest
Northeast and southwest so you might
have found that the previous uh number
was a little same right so that's due to
if you due to this if you try to detect
the
connection we can't detect any
relationships on selected pivot data
right so why did that happen if you go
into the p p window so here you can see
the data on all these things right and
when you go to the state regions you
don't find the state code which is com
which should have been common in both
these right so if you go to the diagram
view so when you look at the both the
tables you don't have a common key in
between these two but when you go to
another table in uh Excel we have
something called state code is to so
that we can establish a connection
between sales state regions and store
regions so let's do that let's go to
data
view okay and now go
to one which we
created we don't need
the to
home data and get data from
stores store locations
data
locations load
to create connection only add this data
to the data
model now everything is fine now we have
three regions or sheets Regions
locations and sales now create the pivot
table you can actually add in the
existing worksheet select the location
here it is so now we have loaded all the
three tables locations table and sales
table which is right over here and also
the state regions now let's go back to
the power pivot which is right over here
and go to diagram View and here we have
it
now we have the state code here drag it
to attach it to the state code region
over here correct that's one
relationship and the store ID which is
here hold and drag it to the store ID in
sales region now we have established a
connection between all these three
tables you can just simply save it if
you want and now okay let's cancel oh
and now if you try to
identify the region byse sales now you
can do it let's add locations region to
rows drag it and add it
here and from sales select order number
and add it to values so it's
automatically to count so we are
counting the total number of sales
happened in Midwest Northeast and South
and in case if you wanted to add more
about let's say store details you can
also add that from region state code or
state so let's select state and Rag and
drop to rows and now if you can expand
or contract this so here you have a
Consolidated table alog together with
statewise and region wise sales and
their numbers right so that's exactly
how the power pivot works so you don't
have to use any look up formulas you
don't have to add some mathematical
calculations it is just creating a
relationship which looks something like
this you're creating a relationship and
it is extracting the data and you know
creating a Consolidated data table just
like you wanted so this exact same
method is implemented in PBI as well so
let's quickly go to PBI window and start
PBI and try to experiment the data mod
modeling in powerbi as well should take
a little while so there you go you have
the powerbi window close this and just
get the Excel
data so we added uh the first one there
you go select the sales team load the
data since it's already processed no
need of data Transformations and data
cleaning this data is all pretty clean
and neat right now let's also add the
other data sets we have it'll take a
little while but it's all right so the
sales team has been successfully added
now we will add region data select the
state regions load it it takes a little
time but it's all right now we have the
state regions as
well product data select the product
data table preview is fine press
okay so we have
products and four down two more to
go select locations
data load
data customer St down five down and one
last one to
go see sta there you go
select the sales
data and now we have loaded all the six
tables to powerbi now unlike Excel so if
you remember
this if you remember this so we have uh
you know manually created the
relationships between the tables but one
good reason why we should prefer PBI is
it can help you automatically uh you
know establish
relationship with other tables so if you
go to manage relationships over here you
have an option called autod detect so it
will automatically detect the
relationships between the tables and it
will create the relationships so you can
find it in here in
options options and settings go to
options here so not that modeling one so
it'll give a new window window on the
screen and here you have an option
called Data load relationships so import
relationships from data sources on first
load or to detect new relationships
after data is loaded in case if this are
not checked then you can just check and
press okay and your data model will be
ready for creation Now here let's create
a table data Matrix data double click on
this so that you have one here just like
the one we created previously just load
the locations so we had region in region
yeah here we have it right just load
region to
rows and maybe you can also add state to
rows and uh you can count the number of
orders we received so it should be
available in the sales data so number of
store ID discount order quantity order
date order number so every order is
unique so I think order number should be
fine you can add order numbers and
values and it can be can count
it and you have okay let me expand this
if possible okay let me close all
this small so this should help us so
just like the pivot table what we
created there we have the same pivot
table here so that's how you can create
the relationship between all the tables
in your data set and you can create a
perfect data model to create the
visualization of your choice so with
that uh back to report and here you have
the report view table View and model
view so if you check the tables you have
customer table view location table view
products table view so if you're
attending an interview then there are
chances where you might be tested about
your skill set like if you really know
power not so they might ask you what
stable what is model view what is report
view so the view where we create the
reports or visualizations is the report
View and the view where you can just
have a look at the data how it is is
called as the table View and this is the
model view where your data is loaded and
powerbi has automatically established
the relationships between all the tables
remember in power pivot we manually
created these relationships but here you
can see in Excel power pivot we had to
manually create the relationships but
here in powerbi you can see powerbi has
automatically created the relationships
so here it has oneway relationship so if
you double click it you can make it two
way so it's not single way anymore you
can make it both the ways and it has a
onetoone cardinality relationship here
right so it it has locations and state
regions so you can find out what type of
relationship is built and what type of
cardinality has been established between
any two tables or any any any number of
tables which are involved in this public
bi data model right and that brings us
to the end on this topic of data
modeling in public bi so this was the
previous model which we created and
that's the new model which we just
created right now so let's start with a
little story meet Joan Joan works at a
company and is always overwhelmed by all
the data terms his colleagues use during
meetings so words like kpis data
warehouse and analytics were thrown
around and Joan often felt lost he knew
understanding these terms was crucial
for his career growth so he decided to
dive into learning about business
intelligence Jones started by learning
what business intelligence actually
means he discovered that bi involves
strategies and technologies that help
companies analyze and manage their data
for example if he worked at Spotify bi
could tell him which songs are getting
the most place when people listen the
most and even predict the next big hit
this realization made Jan see how
powerful bi could be for making informed
business decisions all right so let's
dive in and let's understand what
business intelligence actually is
imagine you're running a popular ice
cream shop and business intelligence is
like having a super smart helper that
tells you everything about your business
cool right so what exactly is business
intelligence it's all the tricks and
tools companies use to understand the
data better it helps them make smart
choices based on facts not just guesses
for example let's say you use a tool
like powerbi in your ice cream shop it
might show you which flavors sell the
most on H days what time your shop is
busiest and which shoppings are most
popular with kids this info helps you
make smart decisions like stocking up on
popular flavors or hiring extra stuff
for busy times business intelligence is
super important because it turns boring
numbers into useful information that
helps businesses grow and succeed it's
like having x-ray vision for your
company NeXT let's talk about data
visualization so data visualization is
the graphical representation of
information and data
by using visual elements like charts
graphs and Maps data visualization tools
provide an accessible way to see and
understand Trends outliers and patterns
in data for example a bar chart showing
the most popular pza toppings in a
delivery app this is crucial for
presenting data in an easy to understand
format moving on we have analytics so
analytics involves the systematic
computational analysis of data for
example using analytics to to understand
which times of day are busiest for a
Piza delivery app this term is important
because it helps in making sense of
large amounts of data and AIDS in
decision making next up is kpi that is
key performance indicator so kpi is a
measurable value that demonstrates how
effectively a company is achieving key
business objectives for example tracking
the number of visas sold each month as a
kpi to measure business performance kpis
are essential for measuring performance
and progress towards strategic goals now
let's discuss data warehouse so data
warehouse is a centralized repository
for storing large volumes of structured
data from multiple sources for example
storing customer data from different gym
branches in one place for analysis it is
used for reporting and data analysis and
is a core component of business
intelligence data warehouses are
important for consolidating data from
different sources and making it
available for analysis next we have
database so database is an organized
collection of data generally stored and
accessed electronically from a computer
system for example a database storing
member records for a gym databases are
foundational for storing and managing
data efficiently and are critical for
any business intelligence processes
moving forward let's introduce data
mining so data mining is the process of
discovering patterns and knowledge from
large amounts of data for example a gym
analyzing member attendance to identify
the most popular class times data mining
is important for extracting useful
information from large data sets next
let's talk about dashboard so dashboard
is a business intelligence tool that
allows users to track key metrics and
kpis for example a dashboard for a gym
showing daily attendance most used
equipment and membership growth it
provides a visual representation of data
and helps in monitoring performance at a
glance dashboard are crucial for
real-time data monitoring and decision
making next up is reporting reporting
refers to the process of organizing data
into informational summaries to monitor
how different areas of a business are
performing for example a monthly
financial report summarizing income and
expenses for a gym reports are essential
for tracking progress identifying Trends
and making informed decisions finally
let's discuss SQL that is structured
query language so SQL is a standard
program language for managing and
manipulating databases for example
writing an SQL query to retrieve all gym
members who joined last month it is used
to query insert update and modify data
SQL is fundamental for anyone working
with databases and business intelligence
tools remember whether you are running a
multi-million dollar Corporation or a
neighborhood laminate stand these bi

smarter decisions and grow your business
they turn row data into valuable insight

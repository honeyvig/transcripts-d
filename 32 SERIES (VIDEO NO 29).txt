hello everyone this is dr. omnium from
team MDS conquer in this 32 series we
are going to discuss 32 important points
regarding extremis point number one
x-ray tube consists of cathode and anode
in a evacuated tube point number 2
cathode consists of a filament and a
focusing cup in which filament is said
to be source of electrons and it lies in
the focusing Cup point number 3 this
filament is made up of tungsten which is
2mm in diameter and 1 centimeter or less
in length point number 4 there is one
person thorium in the filament which
results in increase in the release of
protons point number 5 focusing cup is
negatively charged concave reflector and
is made up of molybdenum point number 6
the x-ray tube is evacuated to prevent
collision of fast-moving electrons with
gas molecules and oxidation of the
filament number 7 anode consists of a
tungsten target embedded in a copper
stem number 8 this tungsten target
converts the kinetic energy of colliding
electrons into x-ray photons now let's
see some characteristics of tungsten the
atomic number is 74 and is most
efficient in producing x-rays the
melting point of tungsten is three
thousand four hundred and twenty two
degrees Celsius and it helps in
withstanding the heat generated at a
node number twelve it has high thermal
conductivity of 173 watts and readily
dissipates heat into copper stem number
thirteen tungsten has low vapor pressure
and at high temperatures it helps to
maintain the vacuum in the tube number
fourteen copper is a good thermal
conductor and it helps to remove the
heat from tungsten and reduces the risk
of target melting number fifteen focal
spot is the area on the target on which
focusing Cup directs electrons number
sixteen as focal spot decreases in size
it results in increasing
sharpness of the image and heat
generated per target area also increases
number 17 the size of effective focal
spot is 1 mm into 1 mm
the size of actual focal spot is 1mm
into 3mm number 19 when the target is
inclined about 20 degrees to the central
x-ray then it causes effective focal
spot number 20 rotating a node helps to
dissipate heat from small so-called spot
number 21 stationery anodes are used in
intraoral x-ray machines number 22
rotating anodes are used in occasionally
in Sofia metric units usually in cone
beam units and always used in medical
computed tomography number 23 filament
transformer helps to reduce voltage of
incoming AC to 10 volts number 24
flow of electrons to the cube from
cathode to anode is known as cube
current number 25 the actual voltage
used on explanation is adjusted with
autotransformer number 26 high voltage
transformer increases incoming current
of 110 volts up to 60 to 120 kilos
number 27 voltage of intraoral machines
OPG SEF Loma technicians East from 60 to
90 kv P whereas old age of cone beam the
computed tomographic machines is from 90
to 120 kv p number 29 he build up at
anode is measured in heat units number
30 heat storage capacity for anodes of
the Intel diagnostic tubes is 20 K H
number 31 frequency with which
successive exposures can be made without
overheating a node a node is known as
duty cycle number 32 typical duty cycle
is 1 is to 6 key that is 0.25 second
exposure for every 15 seconds guys all
the points discussed here are very
important from neat a names point of
view so start preparing notes from these
points and be well-prepared for the exam
all the best
thank you

pain comments SRA is a country singer
and recently she got sponsored by North
American Music company for her new album
she was really nervous and excited about
the performance once all songs were
recorded she was set to release the
album worldwide so when she inquired
about when it would happen she realized
she barely had one week left she
panicked and ran to the manager of that
Music Company Mark to inquire how
everything like editing mixing
portfolios and promotions would be done
in just one week that's when Mark
answered don't you worry our production
is managed on Microsoft Azure Cyra was
confused and asked but isn't Azure a
cloud service used to store your data
Mark smiled and answered well it's true
but Azure is not just that but much more
let me explain it to you mark further
explained that Microsoft Azure is an
open and flexible Cloud platform for
services such as analytics virtual
Computing storage networking and more it
offers a constantly growing selection of
products and services designed to
satisfy all of your demands on a single
practical platform it enables its users
to engage in cloud computing and is
designed to manage tasks through
Microsoft's data centers a data center
is a structure with networked computers
storage systems and computation
infrastructure that organizations like
us use to gather process store and
distribute massive amounts of data upon
learning what Azure is used for she was
still unsure how it would help her in
the album release Mark explained that in
Azure every production happens
simultaneously every day Azure builds
Mission critical solutions to analyze
images comprehend speech and make
predictions using data
simultaneously hence multitasking he he
further added that all the data of her
album for example footage and audio
travel securely to the cloud from even
the most remote locations all the data
is securely stored in the cloud which
can easily be accessed by the editors
and other production members immediately
on realizing every process would run in
parallel Cyra was under the impression
that all this would be a tedious and
timeconsuming job then Mark answered no
only the data relevant to their role
would be accessible to them same
platform same tools same workflow but
just more efficient and secure Cyrus
started wondering ask that it must cost
them a fortune to use such advanced
technology Mark further explained that
the costs are easily controllable so we
only pay for what we use and because our
album is stored in the cloud it's
accessible from every corner of the
world for example producers can review
approve and make changes in real time
and video indexing makes the album
searchable and understandable Predictive
Analytics makes the most of marketing
and distribution strategies therefore no
ad dollars are wasted or seats are left
empty secure distribution means album
releases smoothly and on time as soon as
the audience starts watching and
reacting to every interaction Azure
analyzes their viewing habits to drive
recommendations advertising and
personalization this makes future
production decisions really easy Zara
was relieved to understand this new
technology and how it would help help
her build her future career Azure is the

fundamentals associate and expert level
the future is in the cloud and Cloud
Engineers are The Architects building
the digital infrastructure of Tomorrow
by 2025 it's estimated that the world
will store an astounding 200 zettabytes
that is 2 billion terabytes of data in
the cloud and The Architects building
this digital infrastructure are Cloud
Engineers the best part Cloud
engineering offers a reward ing career
path with immense potential in the
United States alone the average base
salary for an Cloud engineer is around
$117,000 per year if you are looking for
a stimulating career with excellent
earning potential Cloud engineering
might be the perfect fit for you this
guide is your road map to success in the
cloud field we will walk you through a
step-by-step process transforming your
daily routine into a springboard for a
cloud engineering career so buckle up
and get ready to embark on the the
journey to become a cloud engineer all
right so without further Ado let's get
started all right so the first thing
that you should start with is computer
networking so think of cloud as a giant
network of interconnected computers
these computers store and run
applications you access like web
services emails and file storage without
understanding how data travels across
this network it's like trying to
navigate a City without knowing the
streets or signs in the cloud data needs
to move seamlessly between servers
databases and user devices networking is
the backbone that makes this possible
ensuring reliable and efficient
communication so by understanding
networking Concepts like IP addresses
protocols and subnetting you can work
better on some things like first design
and configure secure Cloud networks so
you will know how to set up secure
connections between different parts of
your Cloud infrastructure such as
between virtual machines databases and
external services this ensures that data
reaches the right destination safely
protecting against the authority access
and cyber threats so second we have is
optimize Network performance so with a
solid grasp of networking you can
troubleshoot network issues identify
bottlenecks and Implement solutions to
enhance data flow this ensures that
applications run smoothly providing a
better user experience and improving
overall system efficiency then at third
we have is choose the right cloud
services so yes this is the third point
so different Cloud providers offer
varing Network features and capabilities
so by understanding the basics of
networking you can make informed
decisions about which Services best meet
your needs this helps you leverage the
strength of different Cloud offerings to
build a more effective and efficient
infrastructure now that you have a grasp
of the underlying Network let's dive
into the operating system and powering
cloud environments so the second thing
that is important for cloud engineering
is knowledge of operating system so most
Cloud platforms run on Linux based
operating systems being comfortable with
Linux allows you to interact with and
manage Cloud resources directly imagine
it like having a house key knowing how
to use the key that is the Linux
commands so Linux commands grants you
access and control over your Cloud
environment so Linux provides the
foundation for many cloud services and
understanding it helps you navigate and
manage your Cloud infrastructure
efficiently so by learning Linux Basics
like user management file system and the
CLI that is command line you can first
manage your Cloud instances so you will
be able to configure settings install
software and troubleshoot issues
directly on the cloud servers this
handson control means you can quickly
adapt to your environment to meet the
needs of your applications and services
ensuring everything runs smoothly
then second is automate tasks so Linux
scripting allows you to automate
repetitive tasks saving you time and
effort in managing your Cloud
infrastructure whether it's your
scheduling backups monitoring system
performance or deploying updates
automation streamlines operations and
reduces the chance of human error so
third is work efficiently with Cloud
tools so many Cloud management tools
have Linux foundation so familiarity
with Linux makes it easier to use them
efficiently from orchest isation
platforms like kubernetes to
configuration management tools like
anible knowing Linux helps you leverage
these tools to their full potential
enhancing your productivity and
Effectiveness as a cloud engineer all
right so this was about why knowledge of
operating system is important to become
a cloud engineer so with an
understanding of network and operating
system we can explore the concept of
virtualization which is another
important thing if you want to become a
cloud engineer so virtualization is a
game changer in cloud computing it
allows you to create multiple virtual
machines on a single physical layer
think of it like having multiple
apartments in one building each VM act
as a separate computer with its own
operating system and resources this
capability maximize the use of physical
hardware and provides the flexibility to
run different applications independently
on the same physical infrastructure so
how it helps so understanding
virtualization empowers you to optimize
resource utilization which is our first
point so by creating VMS instead of
using dedicated physical servers you can
efficiently utilize Cloud resources and
reduce cost this means you can run
multiple applications on same Hardware
making the most out of the available
resources and improving overall
efficiency then there is scale
applications up or down need more
computing power for your application
just create additional VMS need to scale
down simply shut down VMS you don't need
virtualization provides flexibility
allowing you to adjust resources based
on the demand without the need for
additional physical Hardware then there
is test and deploy applications safely
so create isolated VMS environments for
testing new application without
affecting existing ones this isolation
ensures that any issues or bugs in the
application do not impact your
production environment allowing for
safer and more efficient development and
deployment processes all right so data
is the fuel that drives most Cloud
applications let's understand how they
play a crucial role in Cloud engineering
so let's understand about database so
data is the lifeblood of most Cloud
applications databases store and manage
this data efficiently understanding
databases is crucial for interacting
with and managing the information
powering your Cloud applications so by
learning about database types like
relational that is SQL and nosql and
Concepts like data quering and
administration you can choose the right
datab datase for your application so
different databases are suited for
different types of data knowing the
functionalities of each helps you select
the most efficient solution for your
needs next is work with Cloud managed
databases so many Cloud platforms offer
manage databases Services understanding
database Basics equips you to utilize
these Services efficiently and manage
your Cloud applications data with ease
the next is troubleshoot data related
issues if your Cloud application
encounters data access problems your
database knowledge allows you to
diagnose and resolve them efficiently so
in these ways database helps a cloud
computing or Cloud engineer now that you
have built a strong foundation in
networking operating systems
virtualization and datab basis it's time
to take your Cloud engineering Journey
to the next level certifications think
of them like badges that showcase your
expertise in specific Cloud platforms so
get certified so Cloud certifications
validate understanding of a particular
Cloud platforms technology and services
they act as a stamp of approval showing
employers you have interested time and
effort in learning the platform and its
functionalities each major cloud
provider that is AWS Azure gcp offers
its own certification programs consider
which Cloud platform you find most
intriguing or allign best with your
career goals now that you have equipped
yourself with the Essential Knowledge
and potentially some certifications it's
time to get your hands dirty with
projects so think of them as your
training ground where you can experiment
apply your skills and build a portfolio
that showcases your capabilities to
potential employeers so why projects
matter that is first one practical
experience real world projects allows
you to solidify your theoretical
knowledge and put your skills into
action you'll encounter challenges
troubleshoot problems and learn valuable
lessons that textbooks can't reach then
next is portfolio building so projects
serve as a concrete examples of your
work create a portfolio website or
online repository where you can showcase
your
projects all right then next is
confidence booster so successfully
completing projects instills confidence
in your abilities you will be able to
confidently discuss your experience and
approach to challenges during job
interviews with your new found knowledge
and certification projects you are ready
to take on the job market so here are
some tips for crafting the winning
application so these tips you should
keep in mind as you walk on a cloud
engineering Adventure All right so the
first one we have is level up via open
source so contribute to open source
Cloud projects gain a real world
experience collaborate with engineers
and work with production G
infrastructure the next is build your
Cloud playground so set up a personal
cloud lab using free tires or low
subscriptions experiment Test new
features and break things safely the

platform as service markets hey everyone
I'm Lance and I want to welcome you all
to this new video from Simply learn on
AWS versus Azure versus gcp in this
video we will compare and contrast AWS
Azure and gcp based on a few related
Concepts around these cloud computing
platforms it will help us understand the
functioning of these top Cloud platforms
and will also let us figure out the
individuality of each one of them but
before starting with the comparison
let's have a quick introduction of AWS
versus Azure versus gcp so let's get
started
Amazon web services or AWS is a cloud
computing platform that manages and
maintains hardware and infrastructure
reducing the expense and complexity of
purchasing and running resources onsite
for businesses and
individuals these resources are
available for free or for a fee per
usage Microsoft Azure is a cloud
computing service that offers a
collection of Cloud Computing Services
for building testing deploying and
managing applications in the cloud
including remotely hosted and managed
versions of Microsoft
Technology Google Cloud platform offers
a variety of Cloud Computing Services
for building deploying scaling
monitoring and operating a cloud the
services are identical to those that
power Google products such as Google
search Gmail YouTube and Google Drive
now let's move on to the comparison
between AWS Azure and
gcp we will be comparing them based on a
few major parameters like
origin service
integration availability
Zone Cloud tools like
compute
storage
networking market
share pricing
and at last who uses
them now let's move ahead and start with
the first comparison
origin in the year 2006 Amazon web
services or AWS was introduced to the
market and in the year 2010 Azure
launched its services whereas on the
other hand gcp was established in the
year
2008 from the start AWS has been
supportive of the open source concept
but the open source Community has a
tense relationship with
Azure on the other hand gcp similar to
AWS provides Google cloud with managed
open-source services that are tightly
linked AWS offers services on a large
and complex scale that could be
manipulated but Azure support is
comparatively low quality whereas gcps
monthly support price is almost $150 for
the silver CL class which is the most
basic of services and is quite
expensive now let's move on to the
service integration of these Cloud
platforms service integration is a set
of tools and technology that connects
different applications systems
repositories and data and process
interchange in real time AWS makes it
simple for users to combine services
such as Amazon ec2 Amazon S3 beanock and
others and on the other hand Azure
allows customers to effortlessly combine
Azure VMS aszure app service SQL
databases and other services whereas
users can utilize gcp to combine
services such as compute engine cloud
storage and cloudsql now that we know
briefly about all these Cloud platforms
let's have a look at the availability
zones of these platforms because AWS was
the first in the cloud domain they have
had more time to build and extend their
network but Azure and gcp both have
various locations around the world but
the distinction is in the amount of
availability zones they have AWS now
offers 66 availability zones with an
additional 12 on the pipeline close to
it Azure is available in 140 countries
and is available in 54 regions
throughout the world but Google Cloud
platform is now available in 20 Global
areas with three more on the
way now let's move on to the next
important factor which is tools now
let's move ahead and have a look at the
first feature which is
compute elastic compute cloud or ec2 is
aws's compute service which offers a
wide range of features including a large
number of instances support for both
windows and Linux high performance
Computing and more Azure on the other
hand as virtual machines is Microsoft
azure's core cloud-based compute
solution it includes Linux Windows
server and other operating systems as
well as better security and Microsoft
program
integration in comparison to its
competitors Google's Computing Services
catalog is somewhat smaller compute
engine that company's principal service
offer for custom and predefined machine
types per second invoicing Linux and
Windows support and carbon neutral
infrastructure that uses half the energy
of traditional data
centers within the compute category
Amazon's different containers services
are gaining prominence it has Docker
kubernetes and it's also fargate service
which automates server and cluster
management when using containers as well
as other alternatives
Azure unlike AWS uses virtual machine
scale sets of two container services
Azure container services is based on
kubernetes and container service uses
Docker Hub and Azure container registry
for management for Enterprises
interested in deploying containers
Google offers the kubernetes engine and
it's also worth noting that Google was
significantly involved in the kubernetes
project providing an extensive knowledge
in this
field now let's move on to the next
parameter of comparison which is
storage simple storage service for
object storage elastic block storage for
persistent block storage and elastic
file system for file storage are among
aws's storage
offerings block storage for rest-based
object storage of unstructured data Q
storage for a large volume workload file
storage and disk storage are among
Microsoft Azure core storage Services
gcp offers an increasing number of
storage options its unified object
storage service cloud storage also has a
persistent disc option relational
database service or RDS Dynamo DB no SQL
database elastic and memory data store
red shift data warehouse Neptune graph
database and database migration service
are are all SQL compatible databases
offered by
Amazon the database choices in Azure are
specifically wide SQL database mySQL
database and postgre SQL database are
the three SQL based choices now when it
comes to databases gcp offers the
sql-based cloudsql and Cloud spanner a
relational database built for Mission
critical workloads now the next
parameter is Network
AWS uses Amazon virtual private cloud or
VPC on the other hand Azure uses Azure
virtual Network or
v-net and gcp uses Cloud virtual Network
now let's move on to another factor
which is market share and pricing all
these cloud services are based on
comparative pricing strategies which
means you need to pay on the basis of
its usage according to Canalis the
worldwide Cloud Market Rose 35% to 41.8
billion in the first quarter of 2021 AWS
accounts for 32% of the market with
Azure accounting for 19% and Google
accounting for
7% on one hand Amazon charges on a
yearly basis and on the other hand
Microsoft Azure and Google services
charge on a minute basis and also all of
them provide you a standard price for
you to access these Services AWS charges
roughly $69 per month for a very basic
instance with two virtual CPUs and 8 GB
of RAM and AWS largest instance with
3.84 TB of RAM and 128 vcpus will set
you back roughly
$3.97 per hour but in Azure the same
type of instance one with two vcpus and
and 8 GB of RAM cost roughly $70 us per
month and azure's largest instance has
3.89 TB of RAM and 128 virtual CPUs and
it cost about
$6.79 per
hour compared to AWS gcp will supply you
with the most basic instance which
includes two virtual CPUs and 8 GB of
RAM for 25% less and as a result it will
set you back roughly $52 every month and
the largest instance that includes is
3.75 TB of RAM and 160 vcpus and it will
cost you about
$532 per hour Amazon other than this
also provides spot instances reserved
instances and dedicated host where you
can look for multiple offers and
discounts but for Azure it provides
special prices to developers based on
situations or even Azure hybrid benefit
which benefits your organization up to
40% if it uses Microsoft software in
their data
centers whereas Google offers quite a
sorted pricing to its customer compared
to the other two it gives you sustained
use discounts which activate if you use
the same instance for a
month the prunable instance which is
very similar to Amazon spot instance es
but one thing is common in all three
cloud services which is that they all
offer long-term
discounts now let's have a look at the
last comparison which is the companies
that are using them because AWS is the
oldest player in the cloud business it
has the largest user base and Community
Support as a result AWS has the largest
number of high-profile and well-known
clients including Netflix Airbnb
Unilever BMW Samsung MinGa and others
with time Azure is getting a large
number of high-profile customers Azure
currently boast around 80% of Fortune
500 firms as customers Johnson Controls
polycom Fujifilm HP Honeywell apple and
others are among its key clients Google
Cloud on the other hand uses the same
infrastructure as Google search and
YouTube and as a result many high-end
Enterprises trust Google Cloud HSBC
PayPal 20th Century Fox Bloomberg
Domino's and other are among Google
clouds mini so this exam is from
Microsoft and easy 104 is is the code of
that
exam now as you can see this is a 104
which is the first step which is a
certification which is nothing but the
first
step to the world of Azor all right now
all right so what is that link that link
is nothing
but nothing but the study guide for you
uh it's a learning path from Microsoft
itself right now what do we have in this
learning
path this learning path is designed to
make
sure people who are be who who wants to
become a your administrator
associate they can follow this learn
path all right now everyone of you I
would encourage you to follow this learn
path whatever session I will be
delivering will be based on this path
only all right so as you can see we have
uh those who are very new to this
session uh to to the world of Azor you
can go with the prequisite for as your
administrator now every course doesn't
matter which course you taking part
every course has its own prerequisites
so if you don't know anything you can go
for this prerequisite all right if you
are an experienced professional if you
have uh if you're already working in I
on in it you're working in VMware or
Windows or Linux you can skip the first
learn path right you can directly start
with the second
one okay so if you click on it every
every uh learning path has some kind of
modules so that's what we will be
following this is the learning path that
we will be following okay now what
happens with this uh if you're following
this learn path make sure you are logged
in so Microsoft keep track of your uh
Journey okay so you can log in here
before before starting any of this uh
learn path now why I'm asking you to log
in because you you'll get some badges so
for example if I log in uh
now and if I complete anything I have
already logged in let me just show
you let me open here right if I
if I go to that particular link so you
see once you log in it keeps track how
many modules you have been completed let
me just ensure that I have logged
in okay so you see the first one is
completed so Microsoft keeps tracks of
your work so once you complete this this
particular path it will show completed
if you have completed 20% it will show
only that number of modules have been
completed and all those things as you
can see the fourth one I have only
completed
97% so that's why uh signing is is
important so you can use your Microsoft
account if you don't have one you can
create one all right now what we will be
covering so I'll be following this link
so if you see if I scroll down what is
required okay so what is expected from
the audience what is expected from the
uh people who are joining a 104 so this
is what is is is you should already be
knowing okay apart from that if I just
simply type a 104 in the
browser okay now this is the
certification page right so if you see
what skills will be me measured when you
go for the exam as you can see what you
should already be knowing as a candidate
for this certification you should have
some information related to network
storage compute all those things and you
should be familiar with OS networking
Concepts servers virtualization in
addition you should have this this this
this this info if you do not have do not
worry we'll start from Basics all
right and what skills will be measured
so if you see a your identities and
governance manage storage deploy and
manage a your compute resources so these
are the five actual uh sections that we
will be covering if you scroll scroll
down uh you should see that this is what
they have mentioned over here identities
virtual network storage a compute
resources and monitoring and backup
which will be which should be our last
uh topic all right so this is what we
are going to cover in our easy 104
syllabus all right apart from that you
can take some practice test you can also
launch the sandbox of exam just to get
an idea how the exam s exam will look
like the this is about the global exam
all right it will not give you any
questions but it will just give you the
sandbox the feel how how your exam
screen will look like all right and
Microsoft has given you some prep videos
as well so before going for the exam
make sure you watch this it's not
mandatory but if you want to have some
more knowledge you can just simply watch
it all right and how many uh minutes we
will be having and then uh the policy of
the exam now these days you can also
take exam from your from the comfort of
your home you don't need to visit any
any peon VI Center or any other Center
you can simply schedule the exam and you
can you can uh do the exam from your
home all
right and then just the languages in
which this exams is available so mostly
I I believe people here are English
speaking so you you might be going for
the English exam right and from here you
can schedule the exam so once you get a
voucher I'm I'm not sure if that is
included in your fee all right you can
you can get that detail from from your
uh from from the person who help you to
get that admin admission over here all
right so you can schedule the exam from
here once you click on schedule it will
take you to the pson vi page you just
need to provide few details and once you
have entered those details you just need
to accept the NDA and once that is done
your exam will be shed
eded all right and once the exam is
scheduled the certification will be
valid for 2 years sorry one year all
right initially it's used to have two
years but since 2022 Microsoft change
2021 Microsoft change it to uh to be
valid for one year but you do not need
to pay for the renewal this the renewal
is free of cost if you do it within 6
months so what happen happens when you
go for the exam once I complete 6 month
from the date of exam Microsoft will
drop me an email right so around 6
December or January I should receive an
email from Microsoft that my
certification now can be renewed So
within 6 month you have to renew your
certification once you and that renewal
is free of cost you don't need to sit
for the exam you can simply renew uh
from your profile itself all right and
it's an open book so uh
it's just done to make sure that you
understand whatever new thing Microsoft
have added or whatever uh new topics
Microsoft have added uh it will test you
on on those new topics right and
obviously it will test your your
knowledge on existing topics as well so
around 25 26 questions will be there
when it comes for Renewal you need to
renew it within 6 month all right if you
are not able to renew it within six
month then I need to retake the exam
okay so that's what you need to uh make
sure that you're giving the exam within
the 6 month so that it will be again
renewed for one year all
right so that's what the renewal policy
is as of now it may change in future but
as of now that's the renewal
policy all right then these are some uh
extra resources that Microsoft have
provided you like study guide so study
guide will give you some
uh some detailed uh requirement for
example what is required so if you
scroll down this is nothing but the
study guide so if I scroll down again uh
what I should be knowing and at
particular uh on a particular section
how many percentage of questions is
expected so for example from the first
section it's expected to be around 20 to
25% and the passing is for uh passing is
around 70% for Microsoft exam so the
total number of marks will be thousand
you need to get 700 marks in order to
pass
right and then uh the sections are
divided into subtopics like what you
should know before setting for the exam
you should know how to create a user how
to create groups how to manage a user or
group how to manage licenses how to
manage guest users this topics all this
topics we will be covering right so as
you can go go through all this so you
should be knowing all all these things
all right before setting for the exams
okay so this is about the exam now what
are the prerequisites so a your
fundamental is the prerequisite but not
mandatory so fundamental Is AO
fundamental is nothing but the a900
certification this is not nothing but
the entry level certification to Azor
Cloud all right now every track in Azor
has a fundamental certificate so does
the as your uh administrator path right
now if you are from database background
if you are from any other background
every topic in Azor uh every track in
Azure has a fundamental certification so
here somewhere we should see that so if
I just scroll up or scroll down
somewhere here we should see
certification
poster you see certification poster over
here so this this will uh give you a PDF
file which you can download and then you
can see which track you want to follow
so if you are interested in
infrastructure so which is the first
certification which gives me the entry
to this particular track so a900 is the
first certification right it's not
mandatory that you should have this
certification before going for EZ 104
but if you want just for example someone
is coming from Google Cloud someone is
coming from AWS you just want to know
what are the equivalent uh Services we
have in aor so you
they can just simply go for a900 and
they can understand understand that
thing right if you're interested in data
or AI so these are the entry level
certification now after getting the
entry level certification what are the
next certificates available so that you
can see under the role based uh
technical skills or role based
certification so first one we have is a
104 then 305 and then specialty uh
specialist certification so if you are
coming from the network background this
is this is what the certification is if
you from the server background this is
what the certification is if you just go
right hand side you can see there are
Developer related courses as well there
is devops related certificates as well
all right and if you go extreme light
extreme R there will be some security
related certificates as well so this is
nothing but a PDF where Microsoft has
all the uh uh whatever Microsoft is
dealing with whatever product Microsoft
is creating
so they have certifications related to
that particular rack all
right so that's about a your fundamental
rights now let's start with the actual
topic so what is a your all right so
what is cloud computing so let's
understand in a simple example what
cloud computing is so if I just want to
explain cloud computing in very simple
term I can say that cloud computing is
nothing but keeping your data in someone
else's computer this is the basic
definition that you'll find over the
internet right if you keep your data in
someone else's computer that is nothing
but cloud
computing right in other words in other
words delivery of IT
services delivery of IT services over
the Internet that is nothing but the
cloud computing
okay so everybody is using cloud
computing cloud is not is not new okay
if you say the uh infrastructure
Services which got famous recently but
cloud is here from more than two decades
now Google Drive is an example of cloud
computing so what are we getting when
when we use this particular service
Google Drive is nothing but it's giving
the storage as a service right I can
keep anything I want want until certain
limit after that if I want to use I need
to pay same goes for Microsoft product
one drive same goes for uh Apple product
iCloud right so there are many if you
remember the first want to do this was
Dropbox and then everybody else followed
right so these are nothing but the
storage as a service so we are keeping
our data and where are we keeping our
data in Google's data center in
Microsoft data center in Apple's data
center or in Dropbox data center
wherever Dropbox is is hosting all right
apart from that there are there are many
services available in the market which
helps us to store our files over there
now what are we responsible for when it
comes to Google Drive let's say I'm
using Google drive to keep some file to
share some file what is my
responsibility so I'm using Google drive
as a user right so what will be my
responsibility my responsibility will be
only the
files the behind the scenes storage and
the servers and all those things whose
responsibility is that the service
providers responsibility right am I
responsible let's say the hard drive
where my file is stored behind the
scenes goes corrupt or goes crashed that
is not my responsibility as a user right
it's Google's responsibility they will
make sure that they have your data right
obviously it's free of cost so you you
won't get any SLA or anything but when
it comes to cloud computing you'll have
some kind of fa so what is cloud
computing is nothing but delivery of IT
services over the Internet okay so that
is what here we have mentioned cloud
computing is nothing but the OnDemand
delivery of it resources over the
internet now what do you mean by on
demand delivery how many of you are
using
olaer olaer is nothing but car as a
service right so whenever we need
whenever we have the demand
at that time we book a car we use that
car right and once the demand is over we
just release that car so that is nothing
but the car as a service similarly when
it comes to cloud computing what we we
get what are what are the it resources
it resources resources are nothing but
servers databases Network networking
components right so all this thing I can
get whenever I need right so if I let's
say I I get an idea and I want to create
an application I want to uh develop an
application what is an application guys
application is nothing but right so you
just need to do some kind of coding if
you have an idea and you want to convert
that into business you need an uh
presence over the internet you need
presence over the you need to reach out
to uh today's generation so everything
we are doing using an application right
so what is that application that
application is nothing but a code behind
the scenes so where do we we write that
code we write that code in a file you'll
be having a file you'll be having if
you're using net or you're using python
most of you might be familiar with
python or you're using Java right so
these are nothing but the languages
using which we can create an app right
so that is nothing but a code and code
is written over a file so in order to
host that application I will be
requiring servers I'll be requiring
database es in order to make sure
communication is possible I need I'll be
needing the network that's all those
thing will be
required okay so how from where we can
get it so we can get that on demand so
if you get an idea today uh in within a
month if you if your application is
ready you need to host that application
somewhere in order to host that
application on servers I need the I need
those servers all right so those servers
I can get from any cloud provider
and I can keep my code over
there okay and how much I'll be paying
I'll be paying if I'm using one server
I'll be paying accordingly if I'm using
two servers I'll be paying accordingly
so cloud computing is nothing but
delivery of it resources like servers
databases Network and many more uh over
the Internet so what I need to uh from
as a from the user point of view what I
need what is my requirement my
requirement is only having a laptop with
an internet connection that's all I
don't need to create a Data Center and
keep my server over there all right all
the cloud providers they have created
data centers for you they have their
servers over there and you can just ask
them for the servers Network for the
databases right for the storage whatever
whatever is your requirement so if you
create an application and that
application requires a server and you
need a server so you can ask the uh
service provider for that this what is
your requirement just internet a simple
example hola obber I have already
provided an example swii we can we can
take that example as well those who are
not from India you can you probably know
food Panda or Uber HS all right so these
are nothing but the food delivery
services app so whenever I need food I
can use these applications and I can
order order the food correct so these
are nothing but on demand uh service
whenever I need food I'm I'm not I'm in
no mood to let's say uh cook my food so
what I can do I can simply use this
applications and order it's like a food
food as a service whenever you need it
you just order and you you'll get it so
what what as a user I need I need a
mobile phone where I have this
application and apart from mobile phone
I need an internet connection thanks to
Gio we all have it now right everyday
2GB 2.5 GB whatever your service pack
whatever your plan is right so you just
need an internet connection and you can
order similarly for it resources if you
if you are in need of it resources you
just need an internet connection with
your laptop and you can how the number
of servers you
want all right so what is cloud
computing in simple terms nothing but an
IT delivery of IT services or it
resources over the Internet what are it
resources nothing but servers databases
storage
Network all right as you can see all
this things you can get you can create
your mobile application you can create
your desktop applications as well you
can create web applications as well you
can create your databases as well uh you
can make use of hybrid Cloud all the
clouds are uh these days supports hybrid
Cloud so you can connect two clouds
together as well for example you have
some of your resources in AWS some of
your resources in Azo and you want them
to communicate with each other you can
you can do that all right so different
types of cloud we have public private
hybrid so what is the difference public
cloud is like anyone can use that
service and can create their own server
private cloud is private to a particular
organization so for example I'm I'm my
organization is let's say making use of
private Cloud
so only I can create resources uh in
that private Cloud I mean my
organization can only create the
resources in that private Cloud public
cloud is available to everyone hybrid
cloud is like your you making use of
private Cloud as well as public cloud or
you making use use of two different
clouds all right you can get servers
from from cloud computing okay another
example I can give you is
electricity so what is electricity guys
we how do we get electricity so there
are some providers if you are from
Mumbai you might know we have tataa
power all right the tataa power provides
us the electricity and how much do we
have to pay
depends on your consumption so if you
consum so if you consume so and so units
you'll have to pay so if today uh if I'm
getting my bill uh uh if this is my
billing cycle uh if today I'm getting
let's say 2,000 Rupees because I have
consumed that much of unit tomorrow if I
consume less I might receive 1,000 or
1,500 only so similarly when it comes to
Cloud Computing how much you'll be
paying so that depends on your
consumption so if you consume more
you'll pay more you'll end up paying if
you consume less you'll pay less all
right so that's what cloud computing
is
okay now what is Azor so Azor is nothing
but the cloud provider Microsoft cloud
provider so you have understood what
cloud computing is all right you have
understood what what uh if I take an
example you have understood what what
electricity is all right now how many
providers do we have in uh do we have
when it comes to electricity you have
data power all right you have Reliance
Reliance is I don't think so uh
providing uh electricity as of now all
right apart from that you have adani
right so there are different different
providers available in the market so
similarly when it comes to cloud
computing Microsoft Azure is the cloud
provider Okay so as you see over here
Azor is nothing but the cloud platform
and Microsoft is the company who is
providing you that cloud
platform okay the Microsoft Azure is one
of the top Cloud providers who another
you have gcp Google cloud so Google is
Google Cloud platform is nothing but the
cloud platform coming from Google we
have ews AWS is nothing but the cloud
platform coming from Amazon you have
Oracle Cloud as well apart from that
there are there are many other providers
as well all right like uh in China it's
it's popular uh Ali Alibaba Cloud all
right IBM is there NTT is there so there
are many Cloud providers but these are
the most uh popular one Microsoft as
your AWS gcp okay Oracle will take I
mean that will also come in future as of
now AWS aure are are the top Cloud
providers available in the market but
people are still people are using gcp as
well depends what is beneficial for your
company uh how good deals they are
getting with which provide which
provider they get good deals with so
they'll they'll mostly use that
particular cloud provider all
right now why should we be moving to
Cloud now before Cloud what was if if
before Cloud what was
there Cloud become famous if you if I
say it become famous around 2015 2016
somewhere around 20156 right since then
people started migrating or moving to
Cloud okay before that also Cloud was
there but it was not that much famous
people were using it using it but not
that much all right so before Cloud what
was there so if you have an idea you
create an application now in order to
make sure people can use that
application I need to host that
application all right and in order to
host that application you require a
server what is server server is nothing
but you can consider uh you might be
using your laptop right so similarly uh
this laptop is for commercial purpose so
you can use this is for your uh home
purpose so for entertainment for your
office work for for running excels and
all those you you have a desktop or a
laptop at your home right if you want to
host an application you'll require
similar kind of uh computer but instead
of having 8 GB Ram r or uh what i7 CPU
it will have more compute power so
instead of 8GB it will have around TBS
of uh uh RAM
similarly uh storage will also be high
the hard disk drive will also be high
the CPU will also be high all right so
if you want to host an application
you'll be hosting that application in
server not on your laptop right so that
server is required in order order to
host an
application so before Cloud we used to
buy this server that will cost you
around in Indian rupees around 1 lakh
something all right and then apart from
just buying this uh uh server you need
to have an operating system as well so
what is an operating system operating
system is nothing but a way to interact
with the hardware of uh of of your
server it it gives you the uh
uh interface to interact with whatever
we have in the in the server all right
so uh you might be using your Windows
operating system in your laptop
similarly for Server we will be
requiring server operating system it can
be Linux can be
Windows all right so Linux is famous
when it comes to server operating system
also we have server operating system
from Microsoft which is known as Windows
Server all right so you need that kind
of operating system so for this you'll
have to pay another license
cost the license cost will be there so
first of all you need to buy the
hardware server that will be around this
much and then you'll need to buy a
license for your operating system if you
decide to use Windows all right if you
go with Linux then different different
distributions are there if you go for
red you'll have to pay for the support
all right apart from that if you want to
use any open source you can use it for
free of cost so you can save there for
license cost but you still need to pay
for the hardware server
all
right so before Cloud we used to buy
this we used to buy the Windows
operating system Windows or Linux
whatever we want we need to deploy that
and on top of it you need to deploy your
runtime right so what is runtime runtime
is nothing but on which language you're
writing your application you're writing
it on Java so you need to have Java
runtime engine installed over here if
you're writing it on python python
runtime should be there Linux Linux
operating system should be there all
right if you B uh if you're writing this
on uhet then net runtime should be there
so it depends on you on on which
language you're writing this application
so that framework you need to install
over here all right apart from that if I
want people to to use my application
what is required how do you access
Google how do you access Google drive or
Google so we need to to go to this
dubdub dub. Google.com this is nothing
but the domain name so you need to buy
this as
well right how how do we buy this this
is you can buy this from GoDaddy you
might be seeing ads uh in in in TV in
Television right so this is nothing but
the domain name so you need to buy this
domain name from any regist so goad is
one of the regist right and behind the
scenes what happens you know every
server every Computing device has an IP
address
right so This Server will also require
require an IP address so that IP address
for that IP address also we used to pay
to the service provider you might be
having internet service provider you're
getting internet connectivity from your
internet service provider if you want
people to reach out to your server you
need a public IP and we will if you need
a public IP we have to buy that from the
internet service
provider okay so here I first of all I
need the hardware server then I need the
oper in system then I need the run time
and then I need the public IP and I also
need a domain and once you have all this
thing then people can use your
application all
right now this once you have all this
thing then people can use your
application and can whatever your
solution is they can use your solution
so if your solution is like swiigy where
you are making a food delivery app so
once you have all this thing then only
people will be able to use it
okay now where I'll I'll keep this
server we have a server we have bought
all this thing but where should we keep
this server if you keep it your
home you need that amount of bandwidth
that amount of reliability and all those
things so we obviously we cannot keep
this at home so where should we be
keeping it so before Cloud we used to
have data centers so you need to build
up a data center what is a data center
is nothing but a huge room where you
will be having different different
racks and inside that rack you'll be
keeping your
servers all right so first of all
imagine today if I go and buy a huge
space how much I'll have to pay so I
just mention the cost of server but if I
want to keep this server I need to have
a data center first inside that data
center you need to make sure you have
proper cooling you have proper power
supply you have proper generator in case
power supply goes down so all these
things is is was required right so how
much I'll have to pay only for hosting
an application today if you
have an idea you just need to focus on
the app development that's
all you simply use any cloud provider
they have already created the data
center for you you ask them that I need
this server so with the server you can
also get the operating system you can
also get uh uh the domain name if you
want to use the free domain name coming
from them you can also use the public IP
address which is which the provider will
provide you so all this thing you can
get from the provider you don't need to
go to different different providers for
example for Windows operating system I
used to go for go to Microsoft for for
IP address I used to go to uh internet
service provider for domain name I used
to go to any domain registers so all
this complex cities have been removed
everything is available over here you
can uh get it from the service provider
itself from cloud service provider
itself all right so what are the
benefits we are getting the first
benefit that I just explain is cost cost
saving so how I'm saving cost over here
imagine I just cleared it but imagine
the same thing you need to buy this
server so I need to pay whatever cost we
uh whatever cost for this server is I
need to pay that upfront
and tomorrow if my app is not working
it's not a hit and just imagine I don't
need this server I've already
paid I've already paid this much amount
and I if I don't need this server then
my this amount is gone obviously I can
sell it but I'm not I'm not recovering
all the amount right so here what I can
do in Cloud if I don't need it I simply
decommission it and I'll only pay for
whatever servers whatever compute
resources I have have consumed so that
is giving you the cost saving over here
when it comes to Cloud you don't need to
pay upfront
amount I don't need to buy any hardware
server I don't need to pay that upfront
cost okay so today if I'm hosting an
application and tomorrow if if if I feel
that I don't need it I simply go and
delete it so I'll only pay for one day
for the amount of time I have hosted
similar to your electricity or water
bills so the amount you the the more you
consume the more you'll pay
all right
scalability what is scalability
scalability is nothing but increasing
the number of servers now imagine back
in before 2015 if I get an idea and I
want to host that application now
whatever I mentioned earlier you need to
pay for the hardware server you need to
pay for the IP address you need to pay
for the operating system you need to pay
for the uh domain name all this thing
we'll have to pay right what if this
server goes down for any reason
will people able to access my
application if this server is down so
your application will be down if because
you're hosting your application on top
of your server all right so if you're
hosting your application on top of your
server if and your server is down people
will not able to reach your application
have you guys tried using IRCTC during
the tatkal time so because of traffic
you can sometimes you can reach you can
open you sometimes you cannot
right nowadays it's quite stable but if
you're old as me I am using ictc from if
I'm not wrong 20 12 or 13 something all
right so back in the days during tkal it
was very very hard to connect to the
IRCTC
website right so why it was very hard to
connect because all over the India
people from all over India trying to
connect to the same domain same and
maybe behind the scenes they'll be
having less number of connections less
number of servers right so if IRCTC
servers goes down you won't be able to
book tickets you need to visit the raway
station and from there you need to book
the ticket so similarly if your
application is down if your server is
down which is hosting your application
then you won't be able to reach people
won't be able to reach right so in order
to avoid that what we can do we need to
buy an additional servers so this thing
adding extra instances to your server is
nothing but
scalability so why do we need
scalability in order to make sure we are
not having a single point of
failure right you if you are working
professional you might be having more
than one person in your team right why
manager ask for more people so that if
any one person is on sick leave other
can handle the workload right so you
have more than one one person over
similarly you'll be having more than one
servers so if I'm paying $1,000 for one
server and if I want scalability I need
to buy additional server so imagine I
need to pay all this thing again server
cost operating system cost right
obviously public IP uh will be using
only one and domain also will be using
only one but for server and operating
system I I'll still have to
pay right so that scalability you can
get over here if you require you simply
go ahead and ask cloud provider add an
additional instance over there so you'll
have scal ility tomorrow if you don't
need it just remove it right security so
when we when we progress uh through our
Azor Journey you'll understand uh how
Azor is securing your data so how Azor
is securing your data first of all it is
isolating your your network with other
organization's Network right so when it
comes to a your you create a virtual
Network and which is which is is a
private cloud in itself right within a
public Cloud you have your own network
so nobody will be able to access your
resources unless you provide them the
access all right and then whatever data
you keeping in Azure all the data will
be encrypted so physically if any person
is having access to the data center and
uh uh that person takes the hard drive
where your data is he or she won't be
able to read that data why because your
data is in encrypted form so in order to
read that data
they need to do the decryption or
unencrypt unencrypt that data all
right deployment in minutes so it's it
will not take a lot time of yours in
order to deploy the server within 5
minutes your server will be ready so
before Cloud just imagine I need to go
to any of the uh shop I need to see
which server is good for my application
I need to buy that server and then I
need to install that server in inside
the data centers rack
and once it's installed I need to make
sure networking is proper all those
things are proper right here I can
deploy a server within 5 minutes and
host my application within an hour if
you have your code ready you can host
within 10 minutes as
well okay so very quick deployment you
just need an internet connection and you
just need to connect to the cloud
providers portal elasticity is nothing
but again scalability but using the
automatic way all right so
uh when the traffic increases I want to
add additional
resources what I can do I can make use
of Auto scaling over here that is
nothing but elasticity all right so Auto
scaling means as soon as your traffic
increases automatically provider will
add additional instances to your uh
solution right when Once the traffic is
traffic decreased the additional
Solutions will will be removed so that
elasticity will will give me the benefit
of automatic scaling and automatic
descaling right whenever whenever as for
the traffic right and Agility is nothing
but the way to quickly recover okay so
aor provides you lot of features or lot
of services which helps you to create
your own Dr site if anything goes down
you can quickly recover so that
possibility is also there so these are
the six benefits that you can get get
when it when it comes to a your first
cost saving will help you to save lot
lot of cost for your company scalability
you can make use of you can add
additional servers whenever needed all
right security your data is encrypted
whenever you're putting your data into
AO Cloud you can deploy your resources
within few minutes you can make use of
autoscaling all right if you don't want
to do the manual scaling AA provides you
the way to uh to configure Auto scalings
as well agility you can make use of
different services in Azure and you can
uh you can configure High availability
and Disaster Recovery when if you
require all
right so this is what the benefits that
we get all right so agility is nothing
but how quickly you can recover from a
failure uh agility is nothing but how
quickly you can recover from a failure
so how can we quickly recover if there
is any failure you you will have to make
sure that that your application is
highly available you'll have to make
sure that you have a disaster recovery
so AIA provides you different Services
which helps you to uh create your Dr
Solutions
okay and why this goes so Microsoft a
your
administrator uh helps your user to
manage cloud services over a your Cloud
right over AO platform so a 104 will
will teach you how you can create your
servers how you can hold your
applications how you can manage
networking how you can manage storage
and all those things right and as you
know Azor is having around 50 55% of
market share so after AWS Azor is the
second top cloud provider z z and ews
are the top two Cloud providers as you
can see you can see the Gardner report
and all those thing and you should see
Microsoft AIO as a second number over
there right uh AWS started way behind
way back all right so it was the first
cloud provider you can say the
infrastructure cloud provider in the
market so that's why it has it is having
the most market share but if you see the
Azor journey and the AWS Journey Azor
has captured lot of uh a vast market
share all
right and maybe who knows if AO comes up
with better Services it can beat ews as
well but ews and AZ is going to be top
cloud providers in the market all
right so this is what we have divided
those five uh sections into this modules
so as of now we are doing the
introduction then we'll move on to
identities and governance then we'll
move on to networking then compute then
storage and then uh monitoring and
backup as your resources that's what my
plan is to cover all right so this is
how I deliver the courses I first talk
about the identities and govern
then I'll show you how you can create
networks then we'll deploy some virtual
machines and all those virtual machines
are nothing but the servers that we were
talking about all right if your solution
requires storage so we'll discuss what
are the different options available for
storage in Azure and then at the end how
to monitor your resources and how to
take a backup of your resources all
right so all those things we will see
now provin is asking me to talk about
Security in Cloud all right so Security
in Azure is like whatever data you
keeping in Azure all the data is first
encrypted and then only added to the
backend servers whatever servers aor is
using to keep your data all right so
your data is encrypted and first of all
since I said that this is a public cloud
and anyone can use it so how your data
is secured that is the first question uh
comes in people people's mind when when
they they want to choose a cloud
computing so how to choose the why to
why we choose Cloud whether it's secure
or not all right so how they make sure
that your data is secure so first of all
every uh customer or every consumer
every cloud consumer creates their own
network so that network is nothing but a
private Cloud for your
company unless you allow someone to
access your
Resources by default they'll not be able
to access so you need to allow them
right so whenever we use any cloud
computing platform they create your own
network so this networks is an isolated
Cloud for your organization for your
company unless and until you allow
someone to access they'll not be able to
access right similarly if there is any
other organization they'll create their
own network so this is an isolated even
though
this organization organization one and
organization two uh using the same data
center they're not able to access their
data unless they provide the access to
each other so that is how the First
Security layer is the second security
layer is whenever you're keeping your
data Azor is encrypting your data all
right and when you access it Azor is
providing you the decrypted format okay
so so how how when I take an example of
Google Drive what happens behind the
scenes Google is having big big data
centers where they'll be having
different servers right inside that
server they're keeping your data so if
someone who has the access to the data
center take the hard drive where your
data is stored they can see what type of
data what kind of data you are storing
in the Google drive right so how to
secure this this this thing because
obviously they need security personal
they need uh the VMware or whatever they
are using as a virtualization platform
they'll need those kind of Engineers who
require access to the
servers so if someone physically goes
into that data center and and take the
hard drive where your data is
stored then he can see what kind of data
you
have so that's why every cloud provider
will encrypt that particular data will
encrypt the data and then keep it on the
data center what is the meaning of
encryption changing the data protecting
the data whatever you have written that
will be protected first right so if you
have written something a BC so that will
be encrypted additional data will be
added over here which is not in human
readable format all right additional
data will be added over here and then
that data will be kept in the data
center right so if someone who has
physical access take the hard drive with
with with him or her and attach that
hard drive to the
laptop he or she will not be able to see
that data in order to read that data
your sh first need to decrypt that data
all right so your decryption keys and
all they will encrypt it and they'll
provide you the decrypted format when
when you're trying to access your data
all right so this is how the security is
done when it comes to Cloud now
obviously there is layers of security so
we have some responsibility they have
some responsibility so as we move
forward you will understand that all
right so this is what we are going to
cover uh in and ay
104 what are the career benefits when it
comes to Azure now if you go to LinkedIn
and search for aure administrator or or
a cloud engineer or an operations
engineer or a SAS operations engineer
you'll see people are demanding a your
right so people are demanding that you
should know you should at least have
have an easy 104 certification so as
soon as you add it add EZ 104 to your
resume uh you will get you will get
uh job offers as well all right you can
go to indeed you can go to LinkedIn you
can go to
Monster uh and you can see what are the
requirements for cloud engineer what are
the salary range as of now right so
salary totally depends on your current
salary or maybe if company is is new so
if you uh if you would have started as
your a 104 back then in a 2015 when it
was new people used to get 200% 300%
height because it was it was very new
Cloud was very new back then now if you
see my market is saturated obviously but
still people are requiring uh AWS
administrators as your administrators
Cloud Engineers right so you need you
you'll definitely get benefit EZ 104
will definitely benefit your career all
right now if you see the market trends
you can search for you can see in glass
door how much salary you are taking
whenever it comes to negotiating a
salary you need first do a research you
see what people are getting all right
obviously if you go to India market
you'll get around 30 40% High all right
but if you do additional certifications
with Azor for example see in a 104 will
only understand the concepts we'll
understand what are the different
services available what are the
different features available right but
you need to contrast or you need to get
additional certifications as well for
example how to deploy this resources how
I can automate deployment of this
resources if you do all those things
together with a Azor obviously you'll
get good job offers okay now you can
search LinkedIn and indate and you can
see how many positions are available so
as the year goes by the
requirement gets on increasing all right
and if you see
it the the last decade 2010 to 2020 what
belongs to the cloud professionals right
this decade
20202 2021 to 2030 will belong to data
and AI all right as you can see every
company is going behind uh artificial
intelligence right so Azor has AI
certificates as well and AI platforms as
well so once you understand Azor if you
do a 104 you will be understanding a
your platform and then you can choose
your track I'm not saying that a 104
will not give you a job AZ 104 will give
you the entry level jobs all right but
as you can see people are moving towards
AI people are moving towards data
engineering data scientist people are
moving towards that okay so you need to
make sure that you're doing a 104 you're
understanding AO once you understand AO
you can take on any certificate uh which
comes after a 104
okay the exam format I have discussed
already from the exam page so quickly if
if you see the exam name is Microsoft as
your administrator a 104 is the exam
code how many questions you'll be having
depend on the questions question set
that you get you'll get 4 to 60
questions that will be multiple choice
questions so you'll be having number of
options all right uh you'll get 120
minutes but you can confirm that from
the Microsoft uh page I think now it's
100 minute if I'm not wrong you can
confirm again that with Microsoft
official document right and the
languages that are available so I'm I
think 100% here uh will be going for the
English language all right but you have
that exam available in different
different languages as well and what
will be the passing score it will be the
it will be 700 out of th000 one more
thing I can share with uh with you is
that why um why Microsoft is asking you
to do to go through this learn
documentation because you have access to
this learn documentation when it comes
to
exam okay so I can access this learn
documentation this a 104 study guide
when it when it's coming when when I'm
sitting for the exam you'll be having an
access so once you launch your exam
somewhere here you should have the learn
documentation option all right so for
example if there is one of the questions
that I'm not familiar that I'm I'm I'm
confused for example let's say there's a
question coming from this particular
topic and I'm confused whether it option
A b c or all of them so I can come I can
I can see I can go to this particular
topic and I can read through it and then
I can select whatever answer I want to
select so that's why Microsoft is
insisting you or recommending you to go
through the Microsoft learn so that when
it comes to the exam you know where
which documentation to look for instead
of wasting time searching for the
documentation searching for the keyword
okay so limited access is given you
don't have internet access uh you'll be
having access to this particular
documentation and you can search for
your if you stuck somewhere you can
search for it all right so that's about
the introduction where we have covered
basics of cloud computing and basics of
uh easz 104 as well somewhat uh the exam
I have shared
portal.
a.com so this is the uh uh platform this
is the portal or this is the web app you
can say where I can interact with the
with azo once you have provided you'll
be landed to this
page you can see the URL over here
portal. oo.com so this is the homepage
that I have
landed okay whatever you're getting just
first time just cancel okay so this is
the link create your free uh account
today the first link so you need to
search like this as your free tier
account and this is is the link that you
need to click on okay if I click on this
link it will land me to the Microsoft uh
website where I can create my fre tier
account now why do you need free tier
account free tier account is like you
can use Microsoft AO for uh first 30
days which will give you 200 as your
credit limit 200 USD $200 us all right
if you convert it to Indian rupees
you'll get around 14,000 or 13,000
something for a month now why do we have
this credit this credit is this credit
is given to you so that you can test few
services for example I create a server I
create a virtual machine so that virtual
machine will be deducted from this $200
us whatever amount whatever how many
days I'll be using those virtual machine
right so that will be deducted from this
$200 if I create any other service like
database or storage or whatever I'm I'm
creating all these services the amount
that is cost will be deducted from the
free tier from the free credit limit
that you have got okay so you'll get
us200 and that will be deducted whenever
you're using now what is the limit what
is the expiry for this 200 USD 30 days
so after 30 days let's say for example I
I was only able to utilize USD so
another another 100 USD is gone so that
is only valid for 30 days after 30 days
you are not getting any credit
okay but the account itself is free for
12
month so this credit is gone but there
are few services that you can use for
another one year so if you scroll down
you
see you have 12 months of free for AZ
your virtual machine for Windows
operating system same goes for Linux
operating system same goes for SQL
DBS storage account and then some other
services so these are always free all
right some are restricted to 12 months
so I can only use that particular
service for 12 months after that if I
want to use I have to pay for 12 months
is free but after that if I have to pay
after that if I have to use I have I'll
have to pay okay some are always free so
I can use lifelong those services so
this particular account that you are
going to create will be free for 12
months some Services you can use always
but obviously with free Serv Services
there are some limits so you cannot use
all the features that they have to
provide like an example of Google Drive
what is the limit 15 GB is limit if I
want to store more if I want to store 30
GB of data I need to pay to a Google
right similarly there are some some free
services but there are some limit if you
read through if you letter if you choose
to go for the database courses so you'll
understand what Cosmos DB is and what
this
means okay so only that particular thing
only that particular uh those particular
services are free not all so if you see
1 GB storage is only free with this
particular service all right so that's
what uh free services are and once the
credit is over and if you're using any
Services apart from this those services
will be shut
down and you'll be asked to convert to
pay as you go in order to use those
Services all right so if you want to
create you can click on start free over
here now what is the requirement when it
comes to a your free toer account the
requirement is you should have an email
address which you have not used
previously to Avail the free services so
you need every time if you want to
create a free tier account you need a
separate email address you cannot use
the same email ID plus you need uh your
phone number
all right if you read through you'll
you'll understand what is required plus
you need a credit card details now this
credit card should be the credit card
which you not you have not used right
now I have already utilized my free tier
account so I won't be able to create a
new one so every time you create a free
tier account you need different credit
card you cannot use same credit card for
all the free tier accounts all right so
one person if they have one credit card
they can use he or she can use only one
free tier account not two or three or
five so this is not the case with AWS in
AWS you can have a separate email
address and same credit card can be used
for creating a free tier account so
that's one thing that I like about AWS
right in Azor it's not like that you
need to have a separate email ID you
need to have a separate credit
card right if I don't have a separate
credit card uh I I can aail this free
service only once right so I clicked on
free tier account and then you need to
provide what your email address all
right so your your your address your
email ID which has access to the email
can receive the email you need that kind
of email address over here and what what
email address that should be that should
be a Microsoft account you can use
Gmail you can use uh GitHub you can use
other signin options you can use all
those account but what behind the scenes
Microsoft is doing it is converting them
to the Microsoft account so you need to
log in and then it will just ask you
free few details of I'll use my personal
email ID over here okay so let's see
another email address so if I use
this so this is my Gmail account but it
will be converted back to Microsoft
account
yeah so once I do next it will ask me
now I already utilized this email
address as well so it will ask me for
the password and once I give the
password uh it will ask me few details
now what what those few details will be
that will be your address your credit
card your phone number all those details
you need to provide so you need to
provide your region your country your
first name middle name last name uh some
are optional some are mandatory right
your phone number once you have provided
the phone number you can you can verify
your phone number by texting or calling
and then you'll have to provide your
address once you do
next you see over here you need to
provide your card details once I provide
all these details and click on next I
need to provide my credit card details
you see identity identity verification
by card so if I utilize that card
already they will uh they'll not process
the free tier account for me so it's
mandatory to have a separate card every
time you want to use a free tier account
all right so that's some limitation that
I don't like about
Azor but yeah if you want to use free
tier account you need to follow this
process once that is done just click on
sign up and you have 3er account will be
ready and in in the right hand side you
can see that uh they will not charge
automatically to your credit card
although they are asking you for the
credit card details but they will not
deduct anything from your credit card
only one rupee will be dedicted just for
verification and that will also be uh
credited back to your account
okay all right and after 30 days once I
have done with my free tier account they
will not charge a single penny to my
credit card unless I convert that credit
uh that account to pay as you go all
right got
it so that's about free tier account if
you want you can create one now I cannot
create since I have already utilized it
all right now I'll go to portal. ao.com
and I'll log in with my
user I'll sign out with this user and
I'll log in with the user that I created
for simply learn
uh
demos so I'll mostly be using my own
subscription for demo purposes all right
so that's about the
introduction all right so as you can see
I have directly been land uh directly
been redirected to portal. aio.com now
I'm using simply Lars lab simply Lars
credentials all right you see odl user
odl user is nothing but on demand lab
user all right so you'll see something
like this uh in your user us name and
password thing all right so coming back
to the topic now so now we will be
starting with our first topic which is
administer
identity all right guys so let's start
with the first topic which
is administer identity I hope this is
visible so what is the first topic the
first topic we have here if you see this
particular topic uh administer identity
so if I go back to Microsoft
uh a 104 study guide all right so what
topic are we covering here we will be
covering the first topic which is
nothing
but manage as your identities and
governance all right so what I have done
we have divided this into three
different topics okay the first one
you'll be just understanding the basic
concepts what identities are what entra
id is and all those things after that
you I'll show you how you can create
users and groups and then how you can
access a your resources right so these
are the four subtopics inside one one uh
section the main section name is manage
as your identities and governance so as
you can see from this particular section
you'll be receiving around 20 to
25% of questions all right and this is
an important topic so let's see what
ident what a your identities and
governance is active directory or if you
are from the Linux background are you
familiar with LP server
okay what is active directory what is
alep server or those who are uh
freshers you might be
familiar I you might be familiar with
with any
uh any platform like Netflix rme
or maybe Google drive or
YouTube right so those who are not
familiar with active directory in l l
app just forget it I'll explain what
identity is all right so what topic are
we going to cover this is divided into
two main topic two subtopic Microsoft
enter ID and user and group account so
what we are understanding over here the
entra idid thing okay now in order to
explain uh enter ID thing uh you need to
know the pre the basics things in order
to understand Microsoft enter ID the
basic thing you need to know is active
directory or L app or you should be a
user of any of this platform so that I
it will be easier for me to uh to
explain this concept to you all right if
you're not familiar with active
directory L app just forget it you are
familiar with Netflix I know 9095 %
people here might be having the Netflix
account all right so what is Netflix
Netflix is a platform streaming platform
right and how do you use
Netflix I'm a new user I want to watch
movies or stream some or watch some
series on Netflix what is the
requirement first requirement or forget
Netflix you just want to access any
service over internet what is the first
requirement service like free service
like Google drive or
YouTube first requirement is register
the credentials create the user account
right so we create the user account that
is the first thing that we
do right user creation is the first
thing that we do when we want to use any
of this platform so what is this user
creation user creation is nothing but
user is nothing but an
identity right what is that identity
so this entra ID that we are we are
seeing over here is nothing but an
identity and access management
solution all right so what we do
whenever we want to use any of this
platform we first create the user so
when you join a new
company when you join a new company what
the administrators
there do for you they create your user
account so so that you can log to the
laptop provided by the organization to
you once my user account is there then
only I'll be able to log in right once
my user account is there in Netflix then
only I'll be able to log in right so
user account creation is the first thing
that is done when it comes when when you
join a new company or when you want to
try out a new platform so what is
identity and access management it is
nothing but a solution which helps you
with this kind of thing user creation
all right now after user creation what
happens once how how do you log to
Netflix let's say you have signed up for
user so are we only providing the
username apart from username you provide
few details right and the main uh one of
the main details from from those details
is password right so user when you
create an user account you first of all
provide the user ID which which is
nothing but your
username and a password so what is this
user ID and password this is nothing but
the you can say credentials so these are
nothing but the credential now why do we
need this credential to authenticate the
user now what is the meaning of
authenticate authenticate is nothing but
verifying whether username and passwords
are correct or
not all right so the first thing that we
do when when someone joins our company
is user creation in that user creation
we have few details like username Which
comp which department this user belongs
to what is the address and all those
things apart from that there are two
main details that we create that is user
ID and the password user ID is nothing
but user identification password is
nothing but the the secure uh string you
can say which can be used which is only
known to this particular user which is
not known by everybody unlike Netflix
where we share our password we do not
share our credentials of uh we do not
share our credentials our us
organization credentials to anyone so
password is nothing but a secure string
which is which should be only known by
that particular
user right in order to verify whether
this user and password is correct or
not we do the process of
authentication so authentication is
nothing but the way or or a method of
verifying whether user is the same user
who he is he or she is claiming to be
right so in order to do this
authentication what do we need first of
all if I'm using an app what Netflix is
doing when I'm creating a user so
Netflix is entering my details in a
database so what whatever my username is
they'll enter my username and in a
secure form they'll enter my password as
well and once I open WB netflix.com in
web browser and I enter my username and
password that gets checked first you
might have noticed if you enter a wrong
password it will show you some some
error wrong credential wrong email ID or
password entered if any one of that uh
user ID or a password is wrong am I
allowed to go in am I allowed to log
into the Netflix no right they they'll
they'll throw this error wrong
credentials I need to reenter my right
credentials cor right so there should be
a mechanism which is checking against it
there should be a database where Netflix
is checking my username and password if
I'm if I have entered correct or not
so this thing of managing username and
password is known as directory service
and directory services are used for
access management for authentication
purposes all right so this the thing
that I mentioned over here these are
nothing but the directory
Services ad is active directory coming
from Microsoft and LP is like an open
source one which mostly we use in Linux
right it's nothing but a protocol but in
Linux we can create an alup server which
is nothing but the directory Services
basically all right so you know if you
want to make use of identity and access
if you want to create users if you want
to provide them access to certain
resources then you need identity and
access management solution if you're
looking for identity and access
management solution then Microsoft entra
ID is the service that we have in Azor
got it have you understood why in the
first place we need Microsoft entra ID
so in order to create users create
groups manage users modify users you
need an identity and access management
solution and Microsoft entra ID is
nothing but an identity and access
management solution that we have from
Microsoft
aor all
right so that's the basic con that the
basic that I I gave you an overview of
first what what directory Serv Services
what authentication is and in Azure what
service do we have to achieve that
particular thing so what topics are we
going to cover first of all we'll we
have already understood what Microsoft
entra ID is and then we'll understand
why should we be using it what are the
benefits and features what are the
different concepts concepts are nothing
but different terminologies involved
when it come to Microsoft ENT ID okay
then we compare uh in previous slide I
just mentioned are you familiar with ad
ad is nothing but uh identity and access
management
solution uh on
Prem okay Microsoft entra ID is
counterpart overcloud but if you want to
use on Prem then there is another
service from from Microsoft which is
which stands for adds which is nothing
but active directory domain services so
if I want to manage by myself everything
then I can make use of active directory
domain services so we'll compare that
what is the difference between both both
the products are from Microsoft so what
is the difference between Microsoft
entra ID and Microsoft uh a your sorry
active directory domain services and
then we'll see what are the different
plans and pricings available apart from
that we'll also see one demo today which
is nothing but self-service password
reset so I I'll help uh I'll explain
what self-service password reset is all
right so let's start with the first
topic that is Microsoft entra ID
benefits and features
so usually this is the slide that I
should uh I I was using to I I used all
the time to make you understand the
concept so you might be having a laptop
in that laptop what what do we do we
create user account and a password so
when user logs into that user account
and password that laptops checks that
with the directory
server if the username and password are
correct or not if the username and
password are correct then only this user
will be able to log to that laptop same
concept is with application as well as I
gave you as I just gave you an example
of
Netflix so when I enter username and
password on Netflix Netflix checks that
against the whatever Services they are
using against that particular service if
the username and password is correct or
not if it is correct then only it will
allow me to
login all right so what is end ENT id
entra id is nothing but cloudbased
identity management
solution apart from Microsoft entro ID
the other product that we just discussed
what is active directory domain services
in order to use active directory domain
Services what are the requirement let me
tell you okay if I want to create my own
directory service I mean I want to
manage all the things so first of all
you need a
server so when we discuss about basic
cloud compy Computing I explained you
why the server is required the another
uh uh use of the server instead of only
hosting the application the another use
of server is hosting this kind of
services so inside This Server I will
need to deploy uh an operating system so
let's say if I want to use active
directory domain Services I need to
install Windows operating system Windows
Server operating
system on top of it I will be deploying
active directory domain services so This
Server will become
the directory
server right once this service is
deployed then I need to promote it to
the domain
controller and once that is done then I
can go ahead and create users
groups I can provide them the access
over the files over the servers and all
those things so what is the requirement
over here in order to create the users
and groups first of all you need to have
a server on top of it you will be
deploying Windows operating system then
you will be installing this particular
service active directory domain services
and then you'll promote it to the do
domain control there are four five steps
involved right this is all when you Ed
to when you want to manage by
yourself what if I say that you don't
need to do anything you will get
identity as a service that means all
this behind the scenes will be managed
by the cloud provider what you can do
you can simply go ahead and create users
and groups so which is
easier if you if you think from the
company point of view from the
organization point of view which will be
easier for me see I'm I'm let's say I'm
not a technical person obviously I
should focus on my business and I should
only focus on creating users and groups
and providing providing them the
access right so if I only focus on the
work that I want to do then obviously I
don't need all these things I can simply
sign up for a your Microsoft and
Microsoft a your account and I have
access to Microsoft ENT ID without doing
anything I just need to sign up for
Microsoft entra
account and I have the access to
Microsoft entra ID so I don't need to do
all this thing I don't need a server I
don't need to install Windows operating
system on top of it I don't need to
install this services and then I don't
need to promote it to domain controller
I can simply sign up I have access to
Microsoft entra ID all right
and I can simply go ahead and create
users and groups all right so what
identity management solution is is is
what I'm explaining over here so in
order to log in what do you do you
provide your username and password to
your laptop and that pass uh that
credential that you have provided goes
to one of the directory server whatever
you have and once your username and
password match that then only that user
will be able to log to the
laptop right so doesn't matter you want
to log into any
application or you want to log into any
laptop or any server there should be
some kind of directory service some kind
of identity and access management
solution which you are
using so your application or your laptop
will check against that database whether
username and password is is is matching
or not if username and password is
matching then only it will allow you to
login same concept all right now when it
comes to Microsoft entra ID Microsoft
entra ID is nothing but the cloud-based
identity management solution you can say
it's nothing but an identity as a
service ID as a
service all right now in order to
explain the benefit of Microsoft enter
ID I gave an example that if you want to
use active directory domain service
which is the Microsoft product for on
Prem directory services so if I want to
use it what I can do first of all I need
a server I need to create a
server inside that server I need to
deploy Windows operating
system all right in order to use adds I
need Windows operating system then I
need to install active directory domain
Services which is nothing but short form
is ads and then you promote it to the
domain controls this is the thing that
you learn in uh Microsoft uh server a
800 or
8001 once all this thing have been
created then only I'm able to create the
users
group I can add user to the group and
then I can provide user access to the
file server or whatever you want them to
access so this is all thing that I need
to do if I want to use on Prem but if
I'm a business owner where my focus
should be on generating revenues and
just avoiding all this thing
but the fact is without this thing
business will also not work right
because I'll be hiring people so I need
to make sure that only the right people
uh who are my employees can access my
resources so I need some kind of
identity in Access Management
Service so I have two options now I can
create a server I can do all this thing
and then I can start creating users and
groups or I can simply sign up for
Microsoft enter ID
all right all this thing behind the
scenes will be managed by aor so we
don't need to bother about all this
thing I just need to sign up for
Microsoft enter ID and I can go ahead
and create users now so all the
authentications and all will be managed
by a since it is nothing but an a a
service it's a cloud service which we
can use how to get access to Microsoft
entra ID you simply need to sign up for
a your account and any similar Microsoft
product like micr
365 so if you have signed up for those
kind of product you already have access
to Microsoft ENT
ID Microsoft entra ID is nothing but a
identity an identity and access
management
service all right the Microsoft entra ID
how you can Define is nothing but a
cloud-based identity management service
so anything which is cloud-based becomes
a managed service and managed service
means whatever you whatever we need to
do all this thing we don't need to
bother about it everything is managed by
the cloud provider we just focus on
creating users creating groups creating
whatever whatever Services they have
different different identity and access
management solution will give you
different
features all right so this is what we
what this is what Microsoft entra ID is
okay focus on concept have you
understood have you understood what
Microsoft entra ID is
we'll go step by step so you'll
understand it better okay so if you have
understood what Microsoft entra ID is it
will be easier for me to just show you a
demo okay so as you can see now I I we
just uh I just shared how to create a
free tier account all right so let's
assume that you have already created an
account if you click this option this is
nothing but the portal menu okay here I
can see all the services available in in
Microsoft CL in Microsoft as your
Cloud so this is known as portal
menu so if I want to search any service
so as of now we are speaking about
Microsoft enter ID so if I want to go to
Microsoft enter ID page to manage my
users and groups you see here you have
the service
listed so I can simply click on this
portal menu and see if the service is
listed or
not right so here you can see Microsoft
enter ID is listed if any of the service
that we are talking about is not listed
over here you see we have a search bar
in a your portal where you can search
for it when I'm speaking about entra ID
you can simply type entra ID so you see
Microsoft entra ID all right so if I
want to go to Microsoft entra ID I can
see I can go to that so if you have
registered if you have signed up for a
free tier account or if you have your
organizational account if if you're
using Microsoft 365 like Microsoft
Office or Outlook or uh teams any other
service from Microsoft you already have
access to Microsoft enter
ID okay so this is nothing but Microsoft
enter ID where you can see under the
manage section we have the option to
manage our users to create or or delete
users whatever obviously it depends on
what kind of access you have okay so if
you if you search for Microsoft Android
you'll be landed and if you click on
that you'll be landed to that page now
remember one thing uh Microsoft entra ID
is nothing but the new name given to a
your active directory all right so they
have just rebranded it with the new name
Microsoft ENT ID so in paper in exams uh
Microsoft a your active directory is now
is now referen as Microsoft ENT ID but
in in in general language in general uh
in in production or in organization we
sometimes you'll hear people saying as
you active directory sometimes you'll
hear people saying Microsoft entro ID so
if you see anyone saying as your active
directory is nothing but the same thing
okay first they named it as your active
directory but since the name was
resembling to active directory domain
Services people used to get confused so
Microsoft has renamed it to Microsoft
entri
ID
okay all
right all right so next topic next
slide we'll understand the different
concept that we have in Microsoft entra
ID what are the different concepts these
are nothing but the terminology of
Microsoft entra ID that we need to
understand right so what what are these
terminologies first of all identity so
what is identity so in Microsoft entra
ID identity is nothing but an object
that can be authenticated
any object can be a user who can get
authenticated right can be an
application which can be an can get
authenticated can be your devices your
computer has an account all right if you
want to authenticate your computer as
well right so identity is nothing but
any object that can be authenticated and
you can authorize that particular object
to provide access to any of the
resources
okay the second terminology is
account and uh account is nothing but a
set of credentials used to access
resources so if any identity associated
with username password or smart card or
any anything which can be
authenticated so any identity which has
a data associated with it like a
username password like a smart card
reader like a biometric any identity
which has some kind of data associated
with it that becomes an
account right what is Microsoft ENT ID
account the account that you create
using Microsoft ENT ID is nothing but
Microsoft ENT ID
account all right what is tenant and
directory so tenant is nothing but a
dedicated instance given to an
organization or an individual whoever
wants to use Microsoft enter ID right
sometimes I would refer to is as as your
active director since this is the recent
change last year only all right so I'm
still used to uh used to use the term a
your active director some if I'm saying
a your active director nothing but
Microsoft ENT ID okay so what is tenant
and directory tenant directory are the
same thing sometimes you will hear
people say tenant sometime you'll say
you'll see people say directory so this
is nothing but a dedicated instance
given to you to an individual or to an
organization okay ten and directory are
nothing but the same thing so this is
this is a dedicated instance given to me
now Azor is a public cloud or a private
Cloud Azor is a public cloud or a
private Cloud it's a public Cloud right
so many people will be using it I will
be using it I have my account my
organization has its own account you
guys have your own account so how Azor
will will distinguish all all other
people's
all other organizations how it will
separate one organization from other
organization so what AO will do if I
sign up I have one tenant if any
organization sign up that organization
is another tenant you are signing up you
are another tenant right so tenant is a
dedicated
instance to an individual or an
organization every tenant how to
distinguish you'll be having a tenant ID
so that tenant ID is nothing but way to
identify y one tenant or another tenant
or another tenant so what is a tenant or
directory is nothing but a dedicated
instance of you can say uh directory
services to one individual or an
organization whoever is signing
up okay so there is nothing but
multi-tenant service where people people
are using uh since it's a public service
anyone can come and anyone can sign up
so in order for aor to distinguish all
this 10 ANS they provide you the they
provide you the directory ID or tenant
ID you can say Microsoft tentra ID
tenant is nothing but a dedicated
instance all right it's a dedicated
instance for one individual or an
organization okay I have my own my
organization if they have signed up they
will have their own you have signed up
you will have have your
own okay one
tenant is dedicated to one uh this
tenant is dedicated to one person or one
organization now if I use the same email
ID and sign up second time and if I'm
creating another tenant I am part of two
tenants it's like a multi Multiverse
over here I'm part of two tenants but
this tenant both the tenants are
separated with each other all right one
organization can have multiple tenants
but both the tenants will be separated
with each
other so whatever user I'm creating over
here are different users whatever users
I'm creating over here are different
users right now there are ways to make
sure that these users are part of this
this users are part of this there are
that is a different topic Al together
all right one company has one tenant ID
that is correct so every customer of AO
will have their own tenant
ID okay so I uh I as as my use as I as
an user I logged in let me just give you
an example uh just explain you over here
so you see I have logged in with the on
demand lab user you see this is nothing
but my tenant ID now if I go to the
users section you see the number of
users part of this
tenant so this two users belong to the
same tenant Labs admin and this user so
this users belongs to the same tenant
now if I create thousands of user over
here all the users will have same tenant
ID all right so all these users will be
trusted by this directory service
whatever directory service I have
created right if I created Thousand
Years thousand users over here all the
Thousand users are part of one tenant
it's like part of One Directory part of
one
company all right but this let's say
this user signs up for a free tier
account so he will have its own
tenant now this user is part of two
different tenant and both the tenants
are separated with each
other if if this user goes ahead and
create another thousands of users this
user this thousand users are different
this thousand users are
different okay real example where you
have a company who wants to use AO
Services if any organization wants to
use AO Services they'll sign up for AO
services so once they sign up how Azure
will identify this
company they'll provide it a tenant ID
so that is a tenant ID dedicated to this
company second company who signs up for
as a your services AO will create
another tenant for them the tenant ID
this is different this tenant ID is
different now both the tenants are
different
tenant they do not have access to each
other's resources unless they explicitly
allow it all right so tenant is nothing
but a dedicated instance to one company
one organization or one individual
whoever is creating the
account okay I can explain in very
simple format which is helpful for
everyone are these two different things
or same things Netflix Prime you have
account in Netflix you have account in
Prime right can I use the same account I
mean I can login using the same
credentials that is possible but can I
use the same user ID and same password
and watch Netflix content while logging
into the prime
ID while logging into the Amazon
prime.com I just go to dubdub Amazon
Prime over here I logged into Prime and
can I watch the whatever Netflix has its
in in in its own uh own uh collection
can I watch that is it
possible no right so these are two
different world similarly when one
company wants to use directory services
and if they're relying on Microsoft
entra ID if they r on Microsoft entra ID
Netflix will create it its own AO
subscription or its own AO tenant and
this will be one
tenant from AO point of view Netflix
will get its own tenant ID like this
same when it's come to Prime they will
sign up for Azo let's just assume that
they're also using Microsoft enter ID so
from Azo point of view this is another
tenant all right so these are two
different tenant Netflix is one company
Prime is another company these are two
different tenants same go goes for hot
star or whatever Services we have
available in the market if they're
making use of aor and Microsoft entra ID
then these three are three different
tenants okay so any account that you
create using Microsoft entra ID that
becomes Microsoft entra account entra ID
account okay so if I make use of
Microsoft entra ID and if I create a new
user you see the new user option over
here if I create it using uh Microsoft
ENT ID that account will become
Microsoft enter ID account so is just
given a term where you are creating
account using Microsoft entra ID uh uh
portal using Microsoft entra ID solution
if you're creating an account that
particular account will be known as
Microsoft entra ID account it's just a
name it's just a logical name that is
given okay uh another question from
Sharad where does it show user are of
same tenant so if you see
see see it's it's quite simple I uh have
you see in Netflix also you you create
different profiles like I have option to
create different profiles in Netflix
right so all these profiles I think four
or five I can create they are under same
account or they are under different
account they're under same account they
use all the all of these users use the
same user ID and password right if you
create different profile so if I log in
using a user account over here that
means I'm logging into one of the tenant
whatever tenant I have been assigned and
once I log into the tenant if you go to
the users option you will see all the
users so if I see all the users under
this tenant that means this user belongs
to the same
tenant okay now obviously I don't know
the user ID and password of all the
users I'm not the admin right I can log
in with my user account only so here I
can see the tenant ID this is my tenant
ID that's all
it's just a logical identification from
AER point of view that this is nothing
but a tenant ID for this
particular this this particular company
simply learn all right so let me just go
through this again see these are just
the
terminologies okay now what it
terminologies whatever Services you'll
be you'll be using every service will
have its own terms own concept own terms
all right so in in general idea if you
say say if I say an user ID that is
nothing but an email ID which you use in
day-to-day purposes in day-to-day
activities like your Gmail ID right
Gmail Gmail account is nothing but your
Gmail ID so it asks you to enter an
email ID and then
password so any user any identity
identity is nothing but and uh object
that can be
authenticated account is nothing but an
identity that had data associated with
it that data is nothing but user ID
email ID password uh your your location
whatever so whatever data you can think
of whatever attribute that you can think
of Microsoft entra ID account is an
account which you have created using
Microsoft entra ID it is that simple I
hope you have understood what Microsoft
entra ID is right what Microsoft entra
ID is is nothing but an identity and
access management solution cloudbased
identity management solution what is
identity management solution that allows
you to create users manage users right
modify users delete users then
authenticate them all those things is
nothing but identity and access
management
solution Microsoft entra ID is nothing
but an identity and access management
solution so if I'm creating an
account user account using Microsoft
entro ID that will become Microsoft
entra ID account if I'm creating it
using active directory
that will become an active directory
account right if I create a Google
account using any of the Google services
like YouTube or Gmail that will become
my Google account these are the simple
whatever Services you using if I'm using
Microsoft entra ID it will become my
Microsoft entra account all right what
is a tenant it's nothing but a dedicated
instance for one company you can say for
one
organization all right and tenant and
director is nothing but the same
thing there's one more term a your
subscription all right now here between
tenant and subscription so remember one
thing Microsoft entra ID tenant helps
you to manage your identities your users
your groups your
applications subscription helps you to
deploy resources now what are resources
deploy servers deploy
Network deploy storage
all right so these are the two different
things now in in order to give a simple
example again I'll take Netflix over
here you can right now you can go into
the Netflix and you can create an
account I can create account that is
free of cost but if I want to watch any
any uh movies or any series I need to
buy a
plan I need to buy one one of the plan
whatever plan they are offering I need
to buy those plan right so so in order
uh in order to watch any any
uh movie or any series I need to buy
that plan I need to pay something so
similarly Microsoft entra ID tenant is
free of cost you can go ahead you can
create you can sign up and then you can
start creating your users but you will
not be able to deploy the resources
you'll not be able to deploy virtual
machine let's say you'll not be able to
create any
network all those thing will not be
possible unless you buy a subscription
okay the subscription is required over
here all right so you need to buy a
subscription once subscription is there
then only I'll be able to deploy all
these resources whatever resources I
want to
deploy there are two things tenant is a
dedicated instance to an organization
where if you're only using tenant you
can create your users create your groups
create your uh you can register your
applications and all those things but if
you want to deploy resources you want to
host your application then you need a
subscription uh in place all right all
right now there is a difference when it
comes to Microsoft tentra ID and active
directory domain Services I just before
starting this topic I explained what if
you want to use uh use on-prem identity
and access management solution then you
have the option of choosing active
directory domain Services all right
Microsoft enter ID is a cloud-based
identity and access management solution
all right so what are the
differences so differences are between
the protocols they are using all right
apart from that Microsoft entra ID is a
manage service so what is a manage
service in order to use active directory
domain Services I need a server I need
operating system to install I need uh
the role that needs to be installed on
this on on top of that Windows operating
system and then I need to promote it to
the domain controller then only are able
to create the user so this is unmanaged
service unmanaged service nothing but
user or company they have to manage it
organization will have to manage this
all this thing that's why they need the
professionals like Windows admin or
active directory admin where they can
manage all these things they can create
domain controllers they can create users
create groups all those
things right this is a manage service
that means everything what we need to do
is is given to us as a service that
means it is managed by someone else not
by us not by the
consumer all right so it's a managed
service so any services like a simple
example Google
Drive Google Drive is a managed service
or an unmanaged
service Google Drive is nothing but a
manage storage service where you are
only responsible to keep your data
similarly for entra ID we are only
responsible for creating users and all
behind the scenes whatever infra is
required that is the responsibility of
the provider same goes for Google Drive
behind the storage service whatever is
required it's their responsibility I'm
only responsible for my data I just
bring my data put my data share my data
with anyone I want all right so that is
the difference between manage and
unmanage now active directory domain
Services uses this kind this protocols
LP Cur
all right for
authentication if any user is logging
into the laptop and this laptop is
connected to the
domain so when the authentication is
happening over here these are the
protocols that have been that will be
used when it comes to active directory
domain
Services all right protocol is nothing
but the language so both should speak
the same language in order to identify
whether the user is allowed to log in or
not allowed to log in where as entra ID
gives you rest apis like you can query
your users using HTTP https protocol you
can do the authentication using all
these new age protocols right like saml
WS fed open ID or with the help of this
new age protocol I can authenticate
users from AWS to a your to Microsoft
enter ID as well that means I have my
resource I have my resources deployed
over AWS
I can create I can use Microsoft entra
ID for user
creation right that is possibility how
it is possible because of these
protocols right so these are nothing but
the language or these are nothing but
the language that is understood by
Microsoft entra ID so if you want to use
your
application if you are creating any
application if you're developing any
application you have a uh application
over here all right so if you're
developing an application and you want
an authentication system the
authentication module for your
application you can make use of open ID
on o over here so you can write your
application in such a way that they they
understand open ID and o o once they
understand that once the application
understand that you can use Microsoft
enter ID for authentication that means
anyone tries to logging into my
application my application will that
traffic for authentication purpose to
Microsoft entra
ID Microsoft entra ID will authenticate
that user and once the user ID and
password is correct I will give access
to my
application all right WS fed is nothing
but the Federation and saml is nothing
but uh I don't know the full form but
saml is like if you want to use let's
say for example I don't know if you are
aware of service now service now is
nothing but the ticketing tool all right
so you might be using uh Office 365
Microsoft 365 in your day-to-day life so
Microsoft 3605 is nothing but the suit
of services like Outlook like one drive
like teams like SharePoint right so
these are nothing but the suite of
services so do I need to provide
different different uh email uh
different different user ID and password
for all these
tools simple example Gmail using Gmail
ID I can make use of all the Gmail
product all the Google product using
Gmail ID whatever ID you have got you
can use YouTube using the same email ID
you can use Google
Drive what what else do we have from
Gmail Google
Sheets all this thing can be accessed
Google meet right all this thing can be
accessed using same email ID so how this
is possible this is known as single sign
on so this is possible using SLE prot
all right so that is the protocol which
is used to do all these things so for
example if I'm using any third party
product which is not coming from
Microsoft service now for example it's
nothing but a ticketing tool all right
so if I want to use it and I have users
in my company I don't want them to use
different email ID for service now
different email ID for Microsoft 365
different email ID for any other
service so instead of providing them
different different email IDs I can make
use of single sign on I can provide them
single ID and I can onboard service now
into Microsoft enter ID using the S
protocol all right then in Microsoft
entra ID Federation Services is
included in active directory domain
Services Federation need to create
separately and now what is Federation
Federation is nothing but trusting any
other identity provider I can give you a
very simple example which will help you
to understand so I don't know if I
logged in over here if I go to Simply
learn.com and if I click on
login we have Google we have Facebook we
have apple we have
LinkedIn so using this what is happening
over here we are trusting Google's email
ID we are trusting Facebook email ID we
are trusting apple apple IDs and we are
trusting LinkedIn as well so this means
you can log in here using your Google
account you don't need to create a
separate account for simply learn you
can use the same account and you can log
in similar you can log in using your
Facebook account LinkedIn account Apple
account so simply learn is trusting all
this identity
provider so that is nothing but a kind
of federation now it's it does not mean
that we have created a Federation over
here this is nothing but a kind of
federation that means we simply learn is
trusting all this IDP identity provider
so similarly if you have two different
organiz
ization right users are over here users
are over here as
well and here you have few resources
like virtual machine like storage
account like SQL databases you want this
user from one company company number one
to access this resources so how to do
that where the authentication will
happen one thing I what I can do I can
create the same number of users same
user ID over here here as well all right
so that is one
possibility but then you need to manage
the user account on both
sides if let's say tomorrow this user
resigns I need to delete the account
from here similarly I need to delete the
account from here so I need to manage
identity both the sides so that's an
overhead that's a uh that's that's
headache for your administrators if I
have thousands of users over here I need
to create thousands of users over here
so in order to avoid that what I can do
I can create a federation server on both
end right and I can
trust company 2's directory
Services Company 2's directory Services
can trust company 1's directory Services
similarly company 1's directory Services
can trust company 2's directory services
that means whenever any user wants to
log to this users uh this uh resources
if I'm trying to log into let's say this
resource VM what will be happening the
directory server from Company 2 will
redirect the authentication request
to directory
one and if it's authenticated then only
the access will be will be provided so
that is nothing but the Federation
Services that's a you that's a big
concept all right and uh that is
included in a your active Direct in
Microsoft enter ID you don't need to
create the Federation Services
separately when it comes to Microsoft
ENT ID so that is directly included all
right but when it comes to active
directory domain Services I need to
create a federation server so I need to
have a dedicated Federation
server but that is nothing but the
Federation trusting someone else's uh
directory Services is nothing but
Federated authentication fed Federated
Services okay all right the last thing
we have over here is a Microsoft entra
ID is a flat structure so I'm not going
into depth into this particular point
because if you're are familiar with
active directory domain services and uh
I promise that this is the last time you
you are hearing adds uh unless you
joining an organization where they are
using active directory domain services
from a 104 point of view this is the
last time I'll be mentioning adds all
right
so if you have worked with adds it has
an hierarchy IC structure where first of
all you create a
forest you create trees and then inside
that you create a
domain all right so this is nothing but
the hierarchical structure then you have
the option to create organizational unit
and all those things here we don't have
that kind of hierarchical structure here
we have a simple tenant that's
all if you have your tenant created you
simply go ahead and create your users in
active directory domain Services you
need to create all these things and then
only you can create your users groups
and all those things right so this is
what we have in adds and this is what we
have in Microsoft entro ID right so it's
a manage service it uses different
protocol when it when it comes to
Microsoft entra ID it uses HTTP https
all right uh Federation Services is
included that means we do not have we do
not need to have a separate server which
will only focus on Federation right but
when it comes to active domain Services
we should have a different server which
will which will do the Federation right
and here we have a flat structure only
tenant that's all we have a tenant you
create users groups here we need to
create all this thing first all right
it's like a single sign on uh protocol
so I can uh I can onboard all this third
party applications SAS based
applications see if you log in you need
to go to enter ID where where will you
find the tenant and user related details
in enter ID because enter ID is nothing
but an IM IM solution so you need to
search for enter ID once you click on
enter ID on the overview page itself
you'll see the tenant
ID if you can go to this page tenant
Microsoft entra ID you should be able to
see the tenant ID okay all right so once
I click over here you might be on
another screen and then once I click
over here you might miss it and then you
won't be able to be on the same page as
of me all right forget about tenant now
have you understood what cloud computing
is all right have you understood what
Microsoft entra ID
is what is Microsoft enter ID in
short I am
service what do you get when you use IM
am
service what what we can achieve what we
can do why in the in the first place
I'll
I'll use enter ID so that I can create
my
users right why why do you want users so
that you have your company where
obviously you will be doing your company
is doing something they're doing some
kind of business so they'll be using
laptop they'll be using uh devices
mobile devices laptops PCS all those
things now their employees will loging
into this laptops and will do their work
right will will they they'll do their
work so in order to create the user
account I need some kind of IM service
so Microsoft enter ID is nothing but an
IM service all right now this
organization if they want to use
Microsoft enter ID they'll have to sign
up so they'll simply sign up so this
let's say this organization name is
organization a so they'll sign up for
Microsoft entra ID they'll sign up for a
your account and they'll get an access
to Microsoft entra ID so for this Oran
organization organization a this is the
tenant ID for them another organization
will do the same thing they'll also log
in they'll also have users and all those
things they'll also have computers and
all those things so they will have
different tenant ID whatever now the
your question is why my tenant ID is not
similar to your tenant simply learn as
sign up for many many directories so
whenever user is logging in behind the
scenes a new directory is being
created and the user is part of that
directory
so it's it's it's it's obvious that you
will not get same tenant ID if your your
two users of your company they are
logging into aor they will see the same
tenant ID since the both the users have
been created in the same
directory all
right prasanjit is again saying simply
learn is not see did I mention that one
organization can create only one
directory if organization a creates
another
directory this is a different tenant
from from Microsoft point of think think
it from the Microsoft point of view are
this the same tenant company is same but
they have created two different accounts
over here two different uh tenants using
Microsoft signup
feature so they can have multiple tenant
one company cannot have single tenant I
did not mention
that one user can create thousands of
directories every directory will have a
unique ID
all right it does not mean that I'm
launching the lab and I'm part of the
same directory if you can see my account
this is my user account if I go to
manage section and go to the users if
you see my user account in your
directory then we are part of the same
ten if you if you don't see my user
account over here we are not part of the
same tenant okay tenant ID you don't
have to do anything about the tenant ID
it is just an identification from
Microsoft point of view if you are the
service provider you take an example of
bank bank is nothing but providing the
banking services so if you have one
customer you'll have one customer ID
other customer will have different
customer ID so similarly one
organization will have one tenant ID if
same user creates another account in
Bank let's say joint account with with
his or her spouse then they'll have
different customer ID so one user can
have two different can Avail two
different services from the bank they're
not restricting users from using
different different Services all right
now Microsoft entra ID comes with
different plans okay so what are these
different plans first of all Microsoft
entra ID comes with the uh with the free
free of cost I mean you don't need to
pay anything you just sign up and start
creating your user so if you see over
here in the overview page itself of
Microsoft entra ID you'll see what kind
of license you have got all right so as
of now my license is free license so it
comes free of cost you don't have to pay
anything you can simply sign up and you
can simply uh start using Microsoft
enter ID all right now if you see
license it's showing as free apart from
free there are few different uh premiums
that are available P1 P2 governance now
why you would be choosing uh P1 P2 or
governance so as you can see over here
some of the features
that are available only with premium all
right some of the features that are only
uh that are available only with
governance so if you need Advanced
security features then you should be
considering choosing the premium tier
all right free tier you don't have to
pay anything but obviously you will not
get all the features consider it like
your Google Drive Google Drive is free
of cost for every Gmail user they give
you 15 GB but if you want to store more
data obviously you need to pay similarly
Microsoft entra ID is free of cost but
if you want to use uh features you can
if you want to use some extra features
like Advanced group management if you
see over here uh if you want to use
conditional access if you it's not
available with the free tier if you
wants to use automated user and group
provisioning to app it's not available
in the free tier similarly there are a
lot of features like privilege identity
manag m not available in the free tier
if you want to use those kind of
additional features which are nothing
but the security features that that gets
covered in a 305 not covered in a 104 so
if I want that kind of features I would
be needing the premium
license all right so the it comes with
four different tier free tier freely
available anyone can use it but if you
want to use additional
features you you would consider to
upgrade from free tier to premium P1 or
premium P2 so I have an uh I have a uh
link over here which will give you uh
detail about all the
features and as you progress in a your
journey you'll understand what this
feature is what that feature is now
obviously a 104 does not cover all the
features but if you have enrolled for a
305 there we cover conditional access
and privileged identity management so
you see we have a free tier then we have
a P1 all right which will cost you do
six per user per month all right we have
P2 which will cost you $9 per user per
month similarly we have the governance
of your pre tier which will cost you us7
now depends on you which feature you
require so according to the feature
requirement you'll be choosing your
premium tier you can try it for the free
uh try free for the first 30 days after
30 days you'll have to pay all right so
you see there are few features which are
available like for example multiactor
authentication is available partially on
on free tier so I can configure
multiactor authentication even in the
free tier as well these are nothing but
the additions available in Microsoft
entra ID all right so if I go back over
here as of now I have the free tier you
can confirm your free tier or you are
having the premium tier or you are
having the premium P2 tier right in
order to try for the premium or premium
P2 Microsoft provides you the 30-day
free trial you can try it from here you
just provide your uh email address and
you can try for free all right you can
also activate it from the portal
itself if I want to activate I can go uh
under the manage section over here under
manage section you should see licenses
from there I can uh activate a free
trial right so you can see I can
activate a Microsoft entra ID
P2 right so for 30 days you can activate
it and after 30 days uh it will
automatically be uh uh deactivated
unless you upgrade to the pay pay
payment
model all right so you'll only be using
the premium tiers when you want to use
this kind of features otherwise if you
are not if you don't want this security
features you can simply go ahead and use
the free tier as well all right security
does not mean that if we do not if we
are not using this premium tier we are
not secured you have the authentication
authentication itself is secured all
right so your data is secured that is
not compromised but if you want to add
some additional security to your
accounts to your tenant then you should
be considering upgrading to P1
P2 all right so that's about the
addition right and the last topic for
this we have uh for this module or for
this topic you can say is uh
implementing self-service password reset
now what is selfservice password reset
as the name suggest you can allow your
users to reset their password by their
own that means what what happens when
you forget the
password let's say you have a Gmail
account and you forget the password what
happens how can you recover your account
if you have forgotten the password I
have a Gmail account but I let's say
forgot my password so what are the
options how to recover my account yeah
OTP to mobile number security questions
correct OTP we have the option to click
on forget and and set a new password so
that is nothing but self-service
password reset Self Service means the
application owner is allowing you to
reset your own password you don't need
to reach out to the Google
helpline right now IM imag how many
people are using Gmail
account billions right all over the
world so if and uh these days everyone
is having a Gmail account right so if
anyone forget the password and and
Google is not allowing you to self to
reset your password by yourself then
what is going to happen everyone will
make call to the help de everyone will
make call to the Google and ask them to
reset the password first of all Google
is providing you the free email services
and then if you're forgetting password
you're calling them to reset the
password so that's that's not a uh best
practice I can say right so in order to
reduce those kind of help deex thing
what you can do you can make use of this
self-service password
reset now we are aware how how this
self-service password reset work what
what we need to do when we create a uh
Gmail account we provide our details
what details do you provide you you
provide your mobile number right you
provide your mobile number your contact
number you provide your if you have a
secondary email ID you provide that
email ID as well you set up few security
questions so that in case you forget the
password Gmail will ask you what was the
first city uh you visited or what was
the uh what was your school name so
whatever security questions you'll be uh
you'll be will'll be setting up right so
you have uh OTP as well if you have
given your contact number they will try
to send an OTP to that contact number
and then you need to provide that
onetime code right so these are the
things that we need to provide first we
need to configure first then only we
will be able to uh reset our own
password all right so these are the
things that we need to provide so
Microsoft entra ID provides you the
option to configure the self- service
password reset for your
users you understood the concept of
Microsoft and ID will be creating users
and all right so I have a Microsoft
entra ID account over here Microsoft
entra ID tenant over
here all right we have this tenant I
have created thousands of users inside
that
tenant I have created thousands of users
inside that tenant if two of the users
are forgetting password what they'll do
they'll they'll log a ticket or they'll
ask their colleague to log a ticket and
that ticket will come to help deex team
or whatever team is managing the
Microsoft entra ID and your help deex
team need to reset the
password right so in order just to reset
the password I have to hire a few people
all right so in order to avoid that
additional cost to your company or you
can use your human resources in a in a
good uh uh required uh things in a good
requirement all right instead of just
resetting password so what you can do
you can use this feature of self-service
password reset you can ask your user to
provide few details and once the users
user have provided all these details in
case in in future if they forget their
password they have the option to reset
by themselves they don't need to log a
ticket to the help de or or a support
team all right or the front end team
whatever team you have so self-service
password reset is nothing but a feature
that helps your users to reset their own
password which is quite require which is
quite a basic requirement these days all
right so user can reset their own
password using a secure automated
process minim Min imizing obviously the
downtime all right what downtime is
minimized since since if user forget the
password he'll simply say the manager
that I don't remember my password I have
forgotten the password I cannot log in
today I cannot work today so that one
day productivity is is is gone for one
user over there right so we have given
this option Microsoft has given you this
option to configure self-service
password reset and once you have
configured it you your users will be
should be able to reset their own
password you can also Implement
multiactor authentication along with
self service password reset so that see
email ID is something which you share
with your people so if I have any email
ID over here email id.com uh whatever my
name at gmail.com so this is my email ID
which I might have shared with people
all over the world so many people will
have access to my email ID they know my
email ID obviously they don't know my
password so what hackers can try to do
they can use my email ID and they
click on forget password and then they
just guess all this thing all right so
in order to avoid those kind of things
in order to avoid those kind of security
risk what we can do along with
self-service password reset we can
enable multiactor authentication as well
all right so that you can uh you can use
just to ensure security then uh you have
the option to select from what are the
methods available for the user to
recover the password so you have this
all these options to select from you can
configure it and you can select whatever
you want all right if you are selecting
security questions you can decide the
number of questions that user will
required to register for the uh
self-service password
reset all right now you need to remember
one thing here what one thing you need
to remember is that self-service
password reset is freely available for
free tier so you don't need a premium
license if you want to use self-service
password reset even free tier will will
work all right the only difference over
here is I mean the only uh thing that I
want to share here
is if you click on end user self-
service and if you see self-service
password uh
reset you see self-service password
reset with on Prem users it's not
available in the free tier that means if
I have
uh active CED domain Services already in
place I have few users over there and I
have Microsoft entra ID as well I have
few users over here in Microsoft enter
ID and I'm synchronizing my uh active
directory users to Microsoft enter ID so
for this on Prem users I will not be
able to use self-service password reset
using the free tier so in if you want to
use you need to go for the uh premium
tier all
right got it so self-service password
reset in free tier is only available for
Microsoft Andra ID users not for the
on-prem
users all right so how to
uh how you can enable Self Service
password reset for your users so first
of all you need to go to portal. aio.com
you need to log in all right and once
you log in you can uh go to your
Microsoft enter ID so you can search for
Microsoft enter ID in the search bar all
right and you can simply scroll down
under manage section you can simply
scroll down and there we have the option
of password reset obviously it is grade
out for me because I'm using simply
learn uh directory and everything is not
available to to the users to the users
that we are creating using the launch
but if you see that in your your own
tenant that you have created either free
tier or your company's tenant if you
have proper access you should be able to
see the password reset over here all
right from here you can configure you'll
you'll directly be landed to the same
screen that we have mentioned over
here all right so that's about
selfservice password reset if you want
to use self service password reset you
just want to go to the password reset uh
section from the man under the manage
section in Microsoft Andro ID and you
can configure all this so what these
options are saying number of methods
required to reset
so you can select either you'll send an
uh authentication email to a secondary
email address or you need to you need
the mobile phone and or you need the
security questions as well so it's it's
up to your administrator if you are the
a your administrator you're managing
enter ID so you need to decide what are
the methods available to the user with
the help of which user can reset their
own password all
right so that's about topic number one
on Prem integration is like I just
explained if you have active directory
domain services that you are using on
Prem and you're synchronizing your users
with Microsoft entra ID so in that case
if you want to use self-service password
reset for your on Prem users you can set
you can do that using this option but
you require a premium uh Microsoft entra
ID license either a P1 license or a P2
license you can go to that link and you
can find out which license is required
all right so that is nothing but on RAM
integration all right see Commando
script you can create by Script you can
create by yourself right how how you can
create you need the apis and all those
thing you need the knowledge of the
scripting and then you can create a
script and then reset a password here
we'll simply get the reset password
option when I log off from here so if I
go back to the browser and if I do
portal. aio.com
here you see can't access your account
you'll have to provide your email ID
you'll have to provide your password and
all those thing will help you to reset
your password if you have if you have uh
registered for the self-service password
reset okay password reset is available
with with free tier if I'm not wrong you
can see it over here password reset end
user self-service so self service
password re uh password change for cloud
user is available with the free tier
it's
if you see over here in the Microsoft
documentation itself this row is for the
this column is for the free tier so if
you see self-service password change for
the cloud user users that you have
created using Microsoft Andro ID they
can reset their own password if you have
enabled it okay on Prem integration is
not covered Prine you need to go for
SC300 if you want to learn more about
see this is a your Administration course
it's not about active directory or
micros oft enter ID all right as your
Administration course will have
different different topics obviously you
need to know different different
Services uh that Microsoft provides you
need to know those
Services uh and Microsoft has included
those Services over here on Prem things
are not included in Azor administrator
if you want to do on-prem
synchronization with Azor I would
suggest you to go for SC300 I don't know
simply learn doesn't provide training on
SC300 or you can go for easy 800 or 8001
all right so these are the two
certificates where on Prem things are
covered in details all right so that's
about the topic number one now we'll
start the second part of
topic this is the agenda which we will
be covering so now we come to the second
topic part number two of configuring
Microsoft entra ID okay so configuring
Microsoft entra ID is
how how you can create users how you can
manage users if you have a requirement
let's say uh your company is hiring
people in bulk and next Monday they are
joining if they are hiring hundreds of
users obviously you need to create their
account in bulk we won't be creating one
by one so we have we need to have some
kind of option where we can create uh
user accounts in bulk so that's what
we'll see how you can create user
account and bul you how you can create
group accounts all right how you can
assign licenses to your users so the
licenses that we talking about premium
P1 premium P2 if you want to use it uh
if you have those licenses how you'll be
assigning those licenses to to your
users or groups and then at the end
we'll do one demo where I'll show you
how you can create a user and a group
and also I'll share one interactive
Labs uh link with you where you can do
the uh interactive Labs uh yourself all
right right so let's start with this
topic let's come to the main topic where
we'll be creating few users all right so
what is a user user is nothing but your
employee so if you have a company for
which you're working and you are the
your administrator and one of the user
is joining in first of all you need to
create their user account right so what
is the user is nothing but your employee
who needs access to your company's
resources all right so whatever
resources you have you might be having
servers you might be having applications
you might be having uh storage account
whatever whatever you have if you want
your employee to access those users or
even a simple laptop that you are having
if you want your user to use that laptop
you need to create an user account for
your user all right so user account is
simply an account for your user which
you'll be creating in Microsoft uh entra
ID so user account in Microsoft entra ID
is nothing but an individual identity
within that particular
organization okay so let's see see
quickly how you can create a user if uh
in order to create a user you need to
again go to your Microsoft entra
ID all right you you should see some
page like this or someone uh some of the
people should see uh all the options
expanded all right if you click on
manage over here you see the first
option that we have under manage section
is it it shows users all right so from
here I can manage create or modify users
if there are any existing users I can
modify them I can create a new users so
let me quickly show you how you can
create a new users all right so as of
now I have only two users if I want to
create a new user where I can go you can
go over here and you can create a new
user you see the option new user from
here I can create a new user right so I
can click on new user over here and the
first option as you can see which says
create a new internal user in your
organization all right so I can click on
it and then I need to provide a few
details over here UPN uh display name
and the password so how to how do any IM
service
work we need to have some sort of
credentials so your credentials will be
your username and password so that is
what we are providing over here username
and a
password okay so if you have multiple
domains over here you can see all the
domains Europe Asia and uh and and some
other part of the world right let's
let's say Australia so if you have these
three domains you need to uh add those
domains as a custom domain and uh any
number of domains that you have added
you should see that over here if you
want to create user for Europe domain
you should select Europe domain from
from this drop down list all right if
you want to create for Asia you need to
do that from this drop down list okay so
as of now I only have one
domain and in order to create an account
I can only create in in this particular
domain as of now all right so what we'll
do we we'll use a simple name user 01 so
what this will become let me just open a
notepad this will become
my you
PN all right this will become my user ID
so this is my user id once the account
is created I can use this user ID and
can log into to a your
tenant all right and apart from that
these are some details display name so I
can type whatever I want whatever your
name whatever your username would be
John do or whatever right so this is a
common name that we use for uh
demonstration so this will be my display
name display name is nothing but the
actual name of your user which you want
uh what name you want to be displayed in
Microsoft entra ID tenant okay and
password you can keep so this is an
autogenerate password so when you create
a new user whenever you create a new
user uh you can provide a default
password and then whenever that user
logs in for the first
time whenever that user logs in for the
first time Microsoft enter ID will ask
that user to change the password
all right so we have we are creating the
user over here and we are change uh we
are giving a default password and then
uh account enable option is whether user
can log in or not so if your user is
logging in uh next week so till then you
can keep the account disable and uh
during uh the joining you can again come
over here and you can click uh enable
checkbox over here and user account will
be enabled so if you keep it disabled
user account will get created but user
will not be able to login okay so it's
like account disable or account enable
once you have provided all this details
you can click on review create and your
account will be created so as you can
see within uh one second the account is
ready so everything okay if you do not
receive any error then sometimes you
should see your user account under
Microsoft entro ID
tenant right now let's try to log in
with this user so in order to log in
what I need I need the username and the
password so these are the username and
the
password all right so I need to log into
the browser so I'll open portal. aio.com
in another browser so that it does not
conflict all right so what what we need
to provide we need to provide the email
ID or the user ID which is nothing but
this I'm providing it over here and then
I'll click on next and it will ask me
for the password so this is the password
that was def default generated password
by Azor enter ID and then I click on
sign in so this is the first time I'm
signing in so it will ask me to reset
the password all right so I can keep now
so this user will keep its own uh his
own password whatever he can
remember right once he has provided the
password he can click on sign in and now
you're are part of the same tenant once
I I have provided all those details I am
part of the same tenant now all right
you can see that if you go to Microsoft
enter ID you can search for Microsoft
enter ID from here or you can enable the
portal menu and you can go to Microsoft
enter ID and from there you can see
you're part of the same tenant now so if
I click on enter ID on another browser
and the browser that I used to log in
the new user now you can confirm that
these are nothing but the same
tenant right c568
c568 okay so user creation is quite
simple you just need to go to the users
section under manage section you need to
go to users blade you click on that you
click on create user you provide the
details and your user will be created
all
right that's about user
creation Now the other section we have
is managing user now who can manage the
user so I created the user because I
have those kind of Rights I have those
rights that is allowing me to create the
user now who can create users in
Microsoft entra ID who can manage the
user so in order to create or manage the
user you need this these rules either
you can you need to be a global
administrator or you need to be a user
access administrator right everyone
cannot create the user right so in order
to prove my point what I'll do I'll go
to the user 01 section so this is the
user that we just created
okay this is the user that we just
created user
01 okay so as you can see user 01 this
is nothing but user 01 all right so user
01 is the user that we just created now
can this user create another user let's
see you see can I create another user
the option is grade out so as user 01 I
cannot create a new user now why I
cannot create a new user that is nothing
but the authorization concept are you
authorized to do do something all right
so in order to explain the authorization
we have a full topic over here but I'll
just brief it what is the difference
between what is the difference between
pm and CM prime minister and chief
minister what is the difference prime
minister has the authority over the
country so if prime minister today
announces anything
it will impact all all the
citizens in in that particular country
all right so the difference between pm
and CM is authorization The
Authority PM whatever he passes will
impact entire country CM whatever he he
passes will impact only a particular
State all right so you see state laws
and Country laws right so whatever PM
says if PM do the demonetization it is
for entire
country all right CM cannot do that CM
will have different kinds of authority
CM has control over the state police pm
has control over the Army right so
different level different level of
authority over similarly when I created
user 01 what he can do can he create a
new user user 02 can you do that how to
assign this if if CM wants to manage the
RB he needs to become the PM in the next
election then only he'll be able to do
that right so if user 02 wants to create
another user if user 01 wants to create
another user he needs to have some kind
of admin
roles all right so that admin roles are
required so in Azor entra ID or uh I
should say in Microsoft entra
ID in Microsoft entra ID you should have
the global administrator all the all the
user access administrator role in order
to manage the user you want to delete
the user get one of this role from your
administrator all right user profile is
optional so not all the details are
required if I go back to the browser
now where I have logged in with the
admin user the user that was that got
created when I launched the lab if I
want to I I logged in with that
particular user which has the authority
to create the users creating a new
user if you see these properties so
these are the optional field you don't
need to provide each and every detail so
what is this property these are nothing
but the extra
attributes okay so if you want to add
additional details for your user what is
the first name of your user what is the
last name of your user what is the user
type whether he a member or guest or
what do you have any certificate are you
doing the certificate related
authentication what is the job title of
user let's say cloud administrator what
is the company name so whatever your
company name is so these are not
mandatory Fields these are optional
field that you can you can provide over
here all right so user profile is not
mandatory you can add all these details
if I go back over here I'll show you the
deleted user letter all right so so what
is the next tab over here assignment so
I said I just said that if you want your
user to
manage other users you need to provide
them this particular role user access
administrator or Global administrator
all right so this role should be
available should be provided to your
user if you want them to manage so how
to assign that R so while creating the
user you have a tab which is known as
assignment that you can make use of so
from here I can assign whatever roles I
want so if this user is Microsoft uh
enter ID administrator so I can search
for those those particular uh role for
example uh user access administrator so
I cannot see that role sorry I clicked
the wrong option okay so as you can see
this is this is the option that we need
to use but because I'm using simply
learn lab I am not allowed to add that
particular role so if you want your user
to manage other users you need to use
this particular uh uh you can say option
and from there you can assign them the
role all right so in order to assign any
role to your user you need to use this
particular
tab all right and once that is done you
can simply click on review and create
now that's when when that's while you
were creating the user if you have
already created user and you want them
to assign you you did to assign them
some role you can simply go to the users
page you can select your user and from
there also you can assign the roles so
under manage section you see assign
roles and from here also you can assign
whatever roles you want this is after
once you have created the user while
creating the user you also have option
to assign the role but once you have
created and after that you want to
assign any assignments or any roles you
can select those assignment role and you
can select for the role for example uh
user
administrator right so I can select this
and I can add this particular role so
once that role is added you can uh
refresh and that that role should be
reflected over here
right so I have assigned user
administrator role to user 01 now let's
go back to the browser where I have
logged in from user 01 so I go back over
there uh in order to refresh now that
role is recently assigned to me so
obviously I need to refresh the token so
let's refresh or you need to relog in
all right now can I
see now am I able to create a new
user all right so this is where I can
create where I can manage so that's what
I'm I'm using over here all right I have
provided this particular user user
01 user administrator role and now this
user can manage all other users as
well okay so now he has the option to
create new
user if I go back to the p uh the slide
over here deleted users so I can once I
have created user obviously I'll be able
to delete the user when you'll be
deleting the user whenever your employee
is
resigning so obviously we need to delete
that particular user otherwise that user
will have access to my company's
resources so whenever any user resigns
you'll be deleting that particular
account okay so how can I delete a
particular account that's quite simple I
can go back to the portal
where I've logged in with the uh user
account all right I go back to the user
section and from there I select that
particular user and here you can see the
delete option so I simply delete it and
click on okay that user will be deleted
now if everything is okay you receive
this notification you just refresh few
times you should not see that
users once you have deleted
it you can see those all the deleted
users over here
all right all the deleted users will be
reflected over here now once you have
deleted the user Microsoft will still
keep them until 30 days after 30 days it
will be permanently
deleted but let's say your requirement
is that you don't want to wait for 30
days so you can select that select that
user and you can delete that particular
user permanently using this particular
option or within 30 days if you feel
that this is the wrong user account
which I deleted and you start receiving
the complaint you can also restore that
that those users within 30 days after 30
days you will not be able to recover all
right within 30 days if you want you can
restore those users all right so that's
about user management and the last
option we have in the slide is log on
information so who is logging in who is
not Lo who is logging in every
information is available you don't need
to uh do any extra uh logging feat
features and all those things so if you
see over here under monitoring section
under entra ID you should see the signin
logs over here all right so you see user
01 just logged in odl user just logged
in whatever so whichever user is logging
in you should see all the uh account
over here right it's whether the login
was successful or failure so login
information is available for you in any
point in time if you want to uh you can
go and you can see all right
that's about log on information that
that's about uh user managing user so in
order to manage user you need this
particular role either the global
administrator or the user access
administrator the difference between
these two roles is global administrator
has full
privileges so it's like a root user
which is having entire access over your
tenant user administrator will only be
able to manage the user
section right he can create users modify
users assign users to any group remove
user from any group he can delete
users all right modify the properties of
user okay so all those thing if you just
want a user to manage another users then
you can provide this particular role to
that user Global administrator if you
provide any user the global
administrator role that particular user
will get the full privilege to your
tenant okay
all right next topic that we have over
here is performing bulk operations as of
now I just created one user user
01
okay now what if there is a scenario
where hundreds of users are joining
in if hundreds of users are joining in
obviously I cannot go uh how much time
it will take for me I can go over here
under user section I can go over here I
can click on create user I can click on
create new user I can provide the
details I can click next review create
so one user is created I can go back
again to the user section I click on new
user create new user it will take
another if one user creation is five
five minutes uh if I'm creating hundreds
of user it will be around 500 minutes
right so we should be having some kind
of option where we can create users in
bulk so that's what this topic topic is
about bulk account updates you want to
create or modify users in bulk uh if you
see the third option over here bulk
operations from this you can do all
right now it's quite simple if you have
worked with active directory you know
that it's it's we need to create a
script or we need to create a bad script
and then only it is possible to create
the bulk uh user user account in bulk
here Microsoft Azure has given you a
simple option where you can download a
CSV file enter the details your username
your password and all those details
upload that file back and your user will
be users will be
created all right so that's what this
bulk operations mean if I have any
scenario where I need to create users in
bulk then I can use this particular
option where I can download a CSV file I
can provide the details I can upload
back that CSV file and the users in bulk
will be created same goes for the
deletion as well all right so I I'll
show you two demos over here so I'll
click on create bulk create over here so
Microsoft is giving you a CSV template
all right I can download
that okay once I have downloaded that I
can open it I just need to provide the
required
details I clicked on open so Excel Will
Will just open all right here if you see
what details are need to be provided
okay so these are the required details
so you see in every uh cell they have
mentioned which detail is required so if
you just provide the required
details the CSV file will be uh once you
have provided all the details which is
required you can upload that details
upload those upload this file after
saving it and then your users will be
created so what you need you need to
provide your user name over here
right so I have already created user 01
so what I do I provide user 02 03 04
just to Quick all right and here you
need to provide the user principal name
so what is UPN UPN is nothing but the
user ID of your
user so for providing UPN I need the
domain name whatever domain name I'm
using over here so this is my primary
domain that I'm using all right so I can
copy this name I can go back to the CSV
file and I can just provide my user name
over here user
02 at the rate whatever your domain name
is all right same I can do uh user 03 at
the rate whatever my domain name is same
goes for user 04 at
theate the domain name and then user
5 at theate the domain name right then
password what password password you want
so you can provide whatever password
make sure you don't have a
space since it will fail uh if I if I do
not remove that space uh the CSV
Microsoft a your entra ID will not be
able to uh read this and your user
creation will fail
right so this are the details that you
need to provide these are the only
required details that we need to provide
you see required required required so we
need to provide only those details these
are not required but if you want you can
get all these details from your uh from
your HR and you can you can fill all
this detail and then upload this
particular file
okay all right so I have I'm creating
four users now whatever password you
want to keep you can keep those password
and this password will be the default
password for these users when the user
logs in obviously it will ask the user
to change the password okay so I have
provided the username the file name is
user create template 2 so I just upload
that file now I go back to the user
section over here I click on the bulk
operations I click on the bulk create
and now I just provide that
file that should be under the download
user create template to and I open it
and I submit it if you have proper
spacing and all those things your uh
user accounts will be created okay you
can also see the operations details by
clicking onto this information option
over here information button over here
so if I click on it it should show me
what is uh what is the status all right
so it is completed you see the status
completed with no errors that mean that
means all the users were successfully
created okay so if I now go back to the
users I should be seeing all all the
users that I just created user 2 3 4
5 okay so if you want to create
thousands of users you just provide
enter those users in the in the Excel
sheet in the CSV sheet and then upload
that
sheet same goes for the deletion as well
so for deletion Microsoft has provided
you another CSV template where which you
can delete U sorry which you can
download you can open the delete file
all right and you just need need to
provide the UPN so in order to get the
UPN I can again go to the download
folder and from there I can get
the uh the UPN that we have in in the
user create template
file all right I can copy the
UPN I can go to the delete file I can
paste it over here
and I can save the file close it go to
the
portal click on the bulk operation click
on sorry this is not the portal from
here uh click on the bulk operation
click on the delete option over here
just provide the delete file from the
download
folder and
and provide a confirmation that yes you
want to do it and click on
submit okay so once it is done your user
should be
deleted so this is the operation you can
see if it was if if any error was was
there to my uh CSV file there was no
error so four users were deleted you can
again go to the all users section and
you can confirm that all the users have
been deleted so you can do those bulk
operations from here
all right so this is quite a simple
thing which I'm showing over here this
will be your day-to-day activities if
you become as your Microsoft Microsoft
enter ID administrator where you'll be
creating users modifying users all right
uh these days obviously company will not
have a dedicated uh person to only
manage this creation and deletion of
users so it would be like managing
entire enter ID where you'll be managing
your devices your users and all those
things all right so the next thing that
we have is a group accounts okay so now
what is a group account now when you
create a
user are we having a single employee in
in in in in a single team do you have
teams different different teams you'll
be having uh project team the
development team you'll be having
managers you'll be having uh virtual
machine administrators you'll be having
Windows administrators you'll be having
different different teams you'll be
having Cloud administrators right so
five people are joining in and they all
are Cloud administrator they need the
same similar kind of role they need the
similar kind of
access how how to do that how to achieve
that for example let's say five people
are joining in as Microsoft enter ID
administrator to my
company so they are Microsoft enter ID
administrators as the name specifies
they'll be managing Microsoft entro ID
so the role that we just saw user
administrator we need to assign them
this
role so one way is just manually create
the user or use the bulk option to
create the user and then assign all the
user the user administrator role so
that's one way but obviously that's not
uh a best
practice what I I can do over here I can
create a
group group account in my Microsoft
enter ID I can add all these five user
to that group account all right and then
instead of assigning all the users
individual roles I will assign that role
to this group so whoever user belongs to
this group will automatically has this
particular
role right so that's why you will be
using group accounts in Microsoft Andro
ID so this is the basic concept where
you'll be using group accounts so you'll
be part of one group you'll be assigning
roles to that group and once the role is
assigned every member of that group will
have will will attain that particular
role so that is nothing but the group
account in Microsoft entra ID we have
two types of groups Security Group and
Microsoft 365 group so these are the two
when when I when I click on create
groups I can see that these are the two
options that is given to me either I can
create a security group or I can create
a Microsoft 365 group so what is the
difference between these two type of
group so security groups are used to
manage users if you want to assign any
kind of permission to your users like
user access administrator like Global
administrator any any other role which
we have in uh Microsoft entra ID
whatever role you want to provide to
your user you will be creating the
security group
types right so that is the purpose of
Security Group if I want to assign any
kind of role to multiple people so I'll
create a security group I put them in
that group and then I assign a
particular role whatever role I want to
uh I want to provide so what are the use
cases of security groups assigning
access permissions to resources or
applications right managing access to a
your resources or if you want to assign
any kind of policies to your group you
can assign the assign that to the
security group another kind of group
that I I we see in Microsoft tentra ID
is Microsoft 365 group so 365 groups are
designed for collaboration like uh if if
you want to use Outlook SharePoint teams
or any Microsoft 365 app if you want
your users to have access to those those
apps you will be creating Microsoft 365
group all right access in the sense I'll
give you a simple example over here we
have a group of monitor team so in that
in that team we have let's say 10 people
10
employees so what is what is the uh job
role of monitoring team what what is
their day-to-day task to monitor your
infrastructure so they'll be monitoring
the your infrastructure any Ro any uh
issue they should be notified somehow so
how they'll be notifying how they'll be
notified Whenever there is any issue so
one way we can use is is
email right so there should be a common
email for all these 10 10
people so if that kind of requirement we
have where if I send any uh email to
this common email all the 10 people
should be
notified how to achieve that so you can
create a Microsoft 365 group for that
and you can put all those 10 people into
that group and then that group will have
an email
ID and whenever you you send an email to
that email ID all the 10 people will
receive all right so for that reason you
can use Microsoft 365 groups another use
case I can say
is teams Channel I don't know if if you
have if you're using teams but I see
most of the companies are using teams in
teams there we have the features of
creating channels
right where I can create a channel for
one
group all the members in that particular
group will be part of that channel and
they can chat they can uh notify
themselves whatever issue they are
facing or if if if any anything they can
they can within the group they can just
uh communicate with with themselves
right so you can create a teams Channel
using Microsoft 365
group right apart from that uh if you
have any SharePoint site where people
need access in in group so you can
create a Microsoft 365 group and you can
provide them access to the SharePoint
site so these are the two types of
groups that you see all
right now if I quickly go to uh the
portal Microsoft entra ID in order to
create a group right right beneath the
users options we have the groups option
over here if I click on
it it will take me to the group page I
can click on new group from there and I
need to provide all this details what
are the details you see this is just
this is what just we discussed the type
of group are you creating Microsoft 365
groups or are you creating a security
group okay so if I select Microsoft 365
group you see automatically and group
email address is is getting
created so whatever members you are
adding to this group all those members
if you send an email email to this
particular email ID all those members
will get uh will be notified about that
particular
email all right mostly we deal with the
security group and the second thing that
you need to provide is the group name
name so let's keep it simple group 01
and then description why this group is
being created or who belongs to this
group you can provide that and and the
option that you can see over here is
membership type so there are three
different membership type that you can
provide uh when it comes to group
creation and assigning the membership
types so there are three types of
assignment that you can select from
assigned Dynamic user and dynamic device
now before explaining this thing just
just give me just give me the difference
between manually
manual and
automatic what is the difference between
manual and automatic manual is something
you're doing yourself automatic it is
automatically happening all right so
that is the difference so that is the
same thing that is the same concept over
here assignments you have to assign the
users to that
group when I create a group I select the
assigned membership that means I as an
administrator manually need to add all
the users whatever user need to belong
to that particular group I need to
manually add those users to the group
all right dynamic means it will happen
automatically now how it will happen
automatically so if you remember when we
created the user there were lot of
properties to choose from the user
profile information so if I again go
back to the user creation
page there are lot of properties to
choose from you can assign all these
properties right like CT email uh age
group usage location even the job
profile related to the job title all
these things you can provide right now
if 10 users are joining as Cloud
administrator what will be their job
title if 10 users are joining as Cloud
administrator the job title should be
either it administrator Cloud
administrator whatever HX administrator
so you will enter that detail over here
Cloud
administrator that detail will get
entered over here all right so Dynamic
membership means you can create few
Dynamic rules with the help of which if
a particular condition is meeting user
will be automatically added to a certain
group for example we have a group of
cloud
administrators so if
job title says Cloud
administrator a your entra ID or
Microsoft entra ID will automatically
add that user to the cloud administrator
group so you can create few rules with
the help of which AIA will add those
users to the ad uh to the to to any any
group that you have created right so
there are two types
of
assignment two types of assignment
assigned membership that means one once
you have created the
group you need to add users
manually all right dynamic means using
some properties user will automatically
get added to the group so that is the
only difference between assigned and
dynamic now in Dynamic also we have two
two uh two types over here Dynamic user
and dynamic
device all right so Dynamic device is
nothing but you will be having Windows
laptop you'll be having Mac laptops
you'll be having Linux machines if you
want to agregate your uh devices from on
the basis of operating systems you can
do that using Dynamic device uh type of
membership all right assigned static you
just need to add manually Dynamic it
will happen automatically just by
looking into the properties all right so
let me just go back to the portal I'll
just simply uh give you a demonstration
how you can create a group I'll click on
new group over here you can uh select
whether you want to go with the security
group or the Microsoft 365 group so
let's say we want to go with the
security group what is the group name
let's go with Cloud
administrator okay group
description this
group
sorry all right whatever you want and
here is the membership type now it is
grade out but if you have a pre uh
premium P1 if you want to use Dynamic
membership you need premium P1 at least
so if you see over here under under
somewhere where we have the group and
find group membership of something you
should you you just find for that and
you'll be able to see uh the dynamic
group membership for dynamic group I
don't see it nothing if I just search
for
[Music]
membership all right so I I know that if
you want a dynamic if you want to use
Dynamic groups you need at least premium
P1 okay now you need to go through each
and every uh feature where it will be
mentioned that in order to use the group
assignment here it is mentioned
application so in order to assign any
application to a group you need premium
P1 or premium P2 similarly somewhere
they might have
mentioned if you want your user to be
dynamically assigned then you need
premium P1 or premium P2 all right so if
you read through each and every feature
you'll you'll get those feat you'll
you'll get that okay so as of now I have
a free uh Microsoft entro ID so I cannot
change from
assigned all right one more option
Microsoft has given to you is that you
can assign owners to your group now who
can be the owner owner will have the
full privilege over the uh Microsoft
entra ID group that means whoever is the
owner can add or remove the users from
this particular group only this
particular group we covered I I told you
that Microsoft entra ID is a flat
hierarchy we do not have any hierarchy
so if I want someone to only manage a
particular section a particular
organizational unit it's not happening
over here in Microsoft Andro ID
but Microsoft has given you another
feature where you can uh assign an owner
to the group and that owner will be
responsible to add or remove users from
this particular
group all right so it's just to
segregate the different level of uh uh
you can say different level of access
over here you can assign owner role to
the team leader or the manager and then
that manager or team leader can add or
remove that particular user right while
creating the group if you want to assign
members MERS you can assign members from
here if I want to assign the user that
we just that that we we are logged in
with if you want this user to be part of
uh this particular group you can assign
while creating the group itself or you
can do it later as well once you click
on create your group will be ready and
sometime you should see your group
reflected over here okay as of now
there's no members to this
group so this is the group that we
created I can click on that group and
then I can add the member over here all
right I can select the user as of now we
only have one user so I can select it
and that user will be part of group
[Music]
01 all right and then you can assign the
rules and administrators as well so this
role will be given to this particular
group okay so that's about group
management the next topic that we have
is
licensing now what is licenses licenses
are nothing but the licenses that we
just discussed P1 P2 apart from that
there are many products that we have
from uh from Azor from Microsoft there
are many products that we have from
Microsoft that you'll be buying your
your company will be buying all right
for example Microsoft 365 license so
what what do we get with Microsoft 365
we get access to the suite of services
like Microsoft teams Microsoft One Drive
SharePoint yamama all all those things
uh Excel Microsoft Office right so all
all access we get when we buy license so
your company needs to buy the licenses
from
Microsoft if you have thousands of
employees you'll be buying those
thousands of licenses one for each
employee so how to assign those licenses
to your
employees right that's what this topic
is about now you can assign licenses to
users as well as groups right so if
group has five members five licenses
will be consumed instead of going to one
user and assigning licenses to that
particular user you can simply assign
licenses to to the group but again you
need the premium feature for that either
P1 or P2 all right so you can gain that
functionality either with P1 or a P2
license if you have P1 P2 license then
only you can assign licenses to the
groups okay so how to do that it's quite
simple if I go back to the group over
here or user over here in order to
assign licenses I can select a
particular user or you can select a
group as well okay if I scroll down over
here you should be able to see the
licenses
option so from here you can assign
licenses to your
users all right same you can do with
groups as well if you go to the group
section
you can assign licenses to the group but
obviously you need a premium feature for
that okay you can click on license and
you can assign licenses to your users uh
to your group and whoever is the member
of this group will be able to get those
licenses right so I cannot select any
since I don't have a premium license so
in order to assign licenses to your
groups you need to have Microsoft enter
ID P1 or
P2 okay
I'll go back to the users section in
order to assign a license but obviously
you need to buy that product from
Microsoft first I don't have any product
I need to pay if I want to
buy if you see licenses and click click
on ADD licenses these are the licenses
available so if you save all these
licenses all the licenses will be
assigned to this user okay now it says
failed one thing I deliberately did it
one thing that you need to do before
assign any license to your user is you
need to make sure that user under user
properties you have assigned the usage
location okay so where is the usage
location you need to find now uh maybe
under job information if you scroll down
you should see
the usage location somewhere so while
creating the user you have the usage
location
option now here I need to search for
it yeah this is the license this is the
usage location that needs to
be provided all right before assigning
any license to your
user okay so this is updated now now you
can go and you can assign the license
but obviously I don't have this this
licenses with me so I cannot assign
those licenses you need to buy these
licenses from Microsoft first and then
only you'll be able to assign those
licenses
as you can see all these licenses are
paid license I need to pay Microsoft in
order to buy those
licenses
okay all right so that's about licenses
the last topic is demo and I have
already demonstrated all this slides
first of all we did the user creation
how you can create a user uh how you can
manage the user in order to manage the
user you can provide them the global
admin right or the user access
administrator right you can provide them
uh the user profile is optional not
mandatory but that data obviously is
required you will get you'll be getting
that data from your HR all right uh you
can recover the deleted users within 30
days okay so Microsoft retains your
users for 30 days after that it will be
automatically deleted right and you uh
in m in Microsoft enter ID Microsoft
keeps the log information so you can uh
analyze the logs if you want we can do
the bulk account
updates we can create group accounts in
group we have two types of groups
security groups and Microsoft 365 groups
security groups are used with when you
want to assign any kind of access to
your users Microsoft 365 groups are used
for collaboration like you want a single
email address for multiple users you
want uh to create a Microsoft teams
Channel you want to create a SharePoint
site for your users so any Microsoft 365
Tool uh that that you want them to
access or you want them to create a s
single mailbox for multiple users those
kind of requirement then you'll be
creating Microsoft 365
groups you have three different assign
actually two different assignment types
all right assigned and dynamic so if you
want to manually add all of your users
to the group you'll be using assigned
membership type if you you want users to
be automatically added you'll be
selecting Dynamic membership type all
right in Dynamic we have two types for
users and for device now how the user
will be automatically
added you can select the properties all
right you can have any property for
example the job title the city where
user belongs to you can use any any of
the information from the profile you can
create a condition and once the
condition is matching user will be
automatically added to one of the group
whatever group you want them to be added
to then you can add licenses but in
order to add licenses you need to make
sure you yourself have the license you
have bought the license from Microsoft
in the first place once you have the
license then you can assign licenses to
your users all right what a guest user
is okay so in Microsoft entra ID we have
the option to invite external user so
what what is ex what what do I mean by
external user external user are the
users who are not not part of your
tenant but you want to collaborate with
them okay so they are part of any other
tenant or any other identity uh
providers so they just need an access to
an email address that's all all right so
when you'll be inviting external users
just you want to collaborate with them
for example you have a virtual machine
in your in your subscription under as
your tenant under this tenant you have a
virtual machine and you you want someone
from uh different tenant or from from
any other uh uh identity provider you
just want them to come to your tenant
access the VM and do whatever their job
is whenever you use it you use it when
you are collaborating with any other
partner
organization and they need access to
your resources in that case I can invite
them to my tenant and then I can assign
whatever access is required so that kind
of scenario where this user is part of
any other tenant or any other email
providers like Gmail Hotmail or whatever
they should be part of the uh the
requirement the basic requirement here
is the user that you want to invite to
your tenant should have an access to the
email
address okay so they should have an
email
ID so external user
is not an user belonging to your tenant
but you can create an user object for
that user by inviting them into your
tenant and then you can assign whatever
access you want them to be uh you want
them to assign you can add them in any
group you want all right it's quite
simple when it comes to inviting or uh
inviting any external user so you just
need an email address so for example I
have one Gmail account I just need an
access to any of the it's not it's not
mandatory that you should be having a
Gmail you can have Hotmail you can have
any email ID your company's email ID as
well all right now if you see over here
in AO portal in Microsoft enter ID we do
not have any user any external user over
here we only have users who are member
users these are not guest users so what
I'll do I'll invite uh an external user
from here from this option all right now
why you should be inviting because you
want to collaborate so let's say this
root Cloud a the account that I'm using
over here is a developer and I want them
I want this user to develop an
application for
me so in order to develop an application
for me for my
organization I would be needing an he
the developer would be needing an access
to my resources right he would be
needing an access to my development
resources my production resources and
all those things so in order to provide
the access first first of all I need to
have an object ID over here so there are
two ways either you can create a
user or you can invite an external user
now in which case you'll be creating
user and you'll be inviting an external
user you will be creating an user when
that user is working for you working for
you in the sense uh he has joined You
full time he has joined your
organization full time all
right if this root Cloud a is a
freelancer and I only want him to work
for me until the application development
is done so in that scenario I'll only
invite that user for a certain period
after that I can delete delete this user
account all right instead instead of
creating a new user account for this
user root Cloud easy what I can do I can
invite him now what is the difference
over here when you invite any external
user the management is at the at the
identity provider that means if user
forgets the password user need to reset
the their password using the uh Gmail
option not using our
option okay inviting external user you
cannot manage that user you can only
delete uh that user you can only modify
the modify the properties of that user
apart from that you cannot manage the
password and all those things for that
particular user so inviting is quite
simple you click on invite external user
and provide the email address to whom
you want to invite so I'll just provide
this email address
should be a valid email
address where user can receive the email
okay so I've provided that display name
you can provide anything whatever you
want and just send an invite
message once that is done properties
assignment are same if you want this
user to be part of any group you can
assign that user uh directly to the
group while creating the user you can do
that letter as well I'm not going into
those things but it is the same thing
that we saw while creating the users all
right as of now I'm not doing it so I'll
simply click on review plus invite and
I'll click on invite so once I click on
invite over here user should receive an
email address from Microsoft entra ID
right and he should be accepting your
invitation once user accepts your
invitation then only uh he will join
your tenant
all right so that is quite simple you
just invite the user using the email
address and once the user accepts the
invitation then you should see that
under uh user
section now for some reason it is
failing so what I'll do I'll just
refresh my portal it's maybe because of
token reactivation or maybe I'm not able
to communicate with the
AO okay so let's provide the email
address over here
and then simply click on review create
and click on
invite or maybe I don't have proper
access over here let's just see if I
just go to portal.
aio.com since I'm using simply learn
credentials might be the access is
restricted we can confirm
that if I go to Microsoft entro ID you
can conf conf that under
properties whether uh users whether user
can invite the external user or
not sorry not under properties under
user
setting you see guest user access guest
users restrictions so from here you can
you can provide the restrictions and you
can uh provide whether non-admin users
can uh sorry whether
yeah whether guest users have the same
access as members or not so all these
settings you can you can uh do from here
okay under the properties you can you
can do those settings sorry under the
user settings you can do those
settings so it's failing I don't see any
error over here but let me it's it's
because of the service connection so
might be I need to relog in or something
or as of now might be something is down
from the Android ID thing or from the
Gmail thing yeah you see I've already
received an email over here but here
it's it's quite failing so let's just
confirm that by going to enter ID
whether user user is invited or not it
might be misleading from
here yep since you see email has already
been triggered but we have been
misleaded by this notification so behind
the scenes it is already uh on the email
is already triggered all right you can
see the user type over here what type of
user it is it's a guest user right it's
not a member so guest user we cannot
change the password if I click over here
uh you should not be able to change the
password of the guest user you see this
is not the home directory for this
particular user so you cannot change the
password okay so password is managed now
this is nothing but what we call as a
federation if you remember yesterday
yesterday I told you that Federation is
included with Microsoft as yours you
don't need to do any extra
setup here what is happening I have
invited a Gmail
account right I have invited a Gmail
account I have my own my own tenant over
here I have invited a Gmail account so
my tenant is trusting Gmail for the
authentication for this particular user
this is nothing but Federated
Services okay a simple example for
Federation now if you do Federation in
your on Prem it's a quite a lot of task
lot of steps are involved here it's out
of the box you just invite the email
address that's
all right now this user needs to accept
the invitation first so I need to go to
this particular email and I need to
accept the invitation from
here let's not do that from here I just
copy the link and I open a incognit
all right and once I open incognito it
will ask me
to to just uh provide the email address
and and the password of my Gmail
account all right so it is asking me to
enter the password now this password is
my Gmail's password then authentication
will be done by Gmail not by Microsoft
okay once I click yes over here you see
some permissions are required if you
accept you'll be landed to the same
tenant all right now I can go to portal.
aio.com and I'm part of the same tenant
now now once user object is
created you can assign whatever access
you
want okay I can go to enter ID I can
search for enter ID and go to the enter
ID from there and you can see I'm part
of the same
tenant
okay I'm I'm logged in with two three
different users over here that's why
it's giving me an
issue and if you see there are a lot of
emails that I have received
probably behind the scenes something is
is is wrong I accepted using this
particular
link let's try another
link what is the tenant ID let me just
confirm the tenant
ID c568
something y so let's try accept the
invitation from this link
Rin is asking me to repo the Federation
Federation is like trusting
other tenant for authentication so here
what we are doing we have one tenant
which we have created we have invited
user which is which belongs to Gmail so
authentication is where authentication
is happening over here Gmail is doing
the authentication he will Gmail will
check whether the username and password
is is correct or not and once it is done
then the login will be allowed okay so
that is nothing but Federation where you
are trusting other identity provider
no that is not required prasanjit
okay so here as you can see now I'm part
of this particular tenant and you see
you should see the tenant ID as well
it's same if you see the
users uh you you should see the odl user
as well all right now I cannot see
because of insufficient privileges so
even the read access is not given to
this user so if you give the read access
then user will be able to see other
users as well
all
right so this is how you can invite your
user you can confirm that by seeing over
here this is the tenant ID c568 if you
go to the
uh if you go to the account where you
have logged in from odl user here you
can see the same thing all right so this
is how external user works so in the
knowledge check that is what the
question what type of user account
allows an external organization to
access your
resources so if you
want any user from any other
organization if you want them to access
the resources in your tenant so what
type of user account you should be uh
the question is what type of user
account it should be which which which
which can access which user can access
your resources from external
organization that means we have two
different organizations over here and I
want users from one organization to
access resources from another
organization so what type of user is it
it's nothing but the guest user
okay sub domains also not required did
you see whether I added the Gmail or
anything I did not WR so it is
Federation out of the box you don't need
to add anything I did not add any
domains over here you need to make sure
that user that you're trying to invite
should have access to the email ID
that's all
okay so that's about the guest users
right now someone was asking me to show
the dynamic thing uh Dynamic you
membership as well so fortunately I've
got the access to the premium uh
premium entra okay so this is my
personal account so if I go to Microsoft
entro ID over here in order to create a
dynamic group I'm showing you a demo of
dynamic group all
right so this is a different tenant if
you see the license over here what what
license I I'm having as of now now this
is not mine actually this is my friend's
okay so since you ask I called my friend
and and get an access to the premium P2
got an access to the premium P2 okay so
this is the license type Microsoft entra
ID P2 now with P2 you can you can uh
create Dynamic groups as well so I'm
just showing you a simple Mo where you
can create Dynamic uh groups and you can
add users automatically all right so
quickly let's create a user so here you
should see the users different users
over here which uh belongs to my friend
and I can click on create new user I can
give it a name you see different domains
so he also has access to different
different domains over
here so it doesn't matter how many
domains do you have if you have
added that as a custom domain you should
see the list over here this is what I
was explaining earlier while creating
the user okay so I I stick to a your
services.in and I'll just name it uh
whatever so let's name it test user all
right same I'll keep as a display name
okay now in order to use Dynamic
membership I need to make sure that I
have some kind of properties over here
so let's make use of the uh
City so let's consider that this user
belongs to
Mumbai all right and then assignment if
you want to assign it to any group or
anything but we are seeing the dynamic
group membership over here so I'm not
assigning directly from here if I
assigned this user to any group this is
the assigned membership this is not the
dynamic membership okay Dynamic
membership it should have happen
automatically you should not be
assigning the user to any group right
and last review create so a user will be
created
to a user will be created with the name
test user so if everything is okay you
should see the test user over
here all right you need to refresh quite
a few time and you should be seeing the
test user here you see the test user if
you go to the test user and you see the
membership he is not part of any groups
as of now all right now let's create a
group now so if I go over here I create
a groups
I click on new group over
here and I name it let's keep it simple
Dynamic group any name you can provide
okay now you see the membership type
here assign Dynamic user Dynamic device
so I'll go for dynamic user since we are
creating a creating an uh group for user
if you are creating a group for device
you should keep it as device okay I'm
creating it for user so let's keep it
user and then you need to add a query a
dynamic query on the basis of that query
user will get user will be added to this
group okay I'm not you see here we don't
have any option to add the user directly
in in assigned membership you should be
having an option to to add the members
in Dynamic you do not have that option
you have the option to create a query
okay so I'll create a query over here
and my query would
be if in the property CT is equals to
Mumbai this is my query if user cat is
equal to Mumbai then add that user to
this particular group so if I create the
group you just wait for a few minutes
and the user should automatically be
added to that group so if I go to the
users over
here if I click on test
user and if I click on groups over here
and sometime you should see that the
group is added over here automatically I
did not add it I just provided the query
okay if you wait for some time five
minutes or something won't take five
minutes but yeah just need to refresh
quite a few
time and this user will be added to that
group we can verify cross verify by
going to the groups as well so
this if I go to the group and if I
search for what was the name of
group dynamic group right so if I click
on the dynamic
group under manage under members you
should see that user so you see test
user automatically added we did not add
that
user right if I go back to uh we can
cross verify by going to the users again
and uh select test user and then select
the membership
select the groups over here and you
should see is automatically added to
Dynamic group all right so that's how
you can make use of dynamic membership
as well now since this does not belong
to me I'll simply click on remove
membership yeah I cannot remove it since
it's a dynamic one I'll go back to the
user I'll delete the
user I make sure that it is deleted from
the deleted users as
well since this is not my tenant I'm
deleting it whatever I have created I go
back to the
group right and I select the group and
delete right so delete groups will be
automatically deleted you don't have the
option to permanently delete them
so that's about Dynamic membership and
uh inviting the guest users let's start
a new topic of
governance so now we are on the second
part of identity and access management
so far we have we have uh understood
what identity is okay what is an
identity is nothing but a user account
you can say or a group account you can
say all right now we are coming to the
second part all right now what is that
second part that is the
governance what is governance governance
is nothing but restricting your users
from doing something for example we have
uh laws in in our country right in the
land we have some laws that we need to
follow similarly when you join any
organization they will restrict you from
doing something they'll allow you to do
something right for example when you
join a new company
if you join as an virtual machine
administrator you should only be able to
do the virtual machine related task you
should not be touching
databases if you're joining as a
database administrator you should only
be doing the database related task you
should not be touching anything else if
you join as a network administrator you
will be doing the network related
thing right if I don't do any kind of
restriction and if I create a user and
all the users are having same kind of
access what problem can
occur if you do not Implement governance
properly I have let's say two users in
my company I do not have governance this
user has same similar kind of access
this user has similar kind of access if
I do not have governance now here I'm
taking only example of two people but
you'll be having thousands of
employees if you do not do governance
governance is nothing but Access Control
Access Control mechanism Access Control
Management if if you do not do that what
could go
wrong anyone can access anything for
example you have a brad
server and let's say this guys join
simply Le easy 104 course as of now so
they just want to try if you do not
Implement governance what what is the
possibility over there they can log into
to the prod server they can try whatever
they have seen in the
class and once they try that on on on on
production server there is a possibility
that your BR application will go
down so if you do not restrict your
users then these are the possibilities
and you may lose your business all right
you may you may lose some amount uh if
if your Production service is down for
that but for more than four five hours
and if you have SLS to give to your if
you have given SLS to your end
users they might sue you right so we
need to have restrictions in
place okay we need to make sure that
only users who required proper access uh
only users who required access they have
the proper access you need to make sure
that they have the limited access they
do not have the full access so how to
achieve all those things so that can be
achieved using governance and
compliance so what is covered in this
topic regions subscriptions what is
Resource Group what is the service limit
what is hierarchy in Azor what is what
are tags how you can optimize cost what
is a your policy what is role based
access control and resource locks so
what is a
region when it comes to uh cloud
computing regions are nothing but
physical data center okay every cloud
provider have created lots of data
centers all across the
world and they call those data centers
as as region so region is nothing but
collection of data center now what is a
data center that might be the question
so I don't know if you if you know or
not if you search for data
center this is what data center is this
is how it looks like okay these are all
the different data centers you can
search for Microsoft data center as well
and you should see the image okay so
what is a data center it's a huge room
where you have your
servers these are nothing but your racks
okay inside the rack you'll be having
all the Computing devices your servers
your routers your databases all those
things so what this Cloud providers have
done they have gone to each part of the
world and they have created this big big
data centers so for example if I take an
example of India so in India aor is
having three region one in central India
one in West India and one in in South
India so this is the name that Azor has
provided all right so in central India
azour is having multiple data centers
same goes for West India same goes for
South India so the collection of data
center is nothing but a
region all right so region is just the
physical location where Azure has its
data
center okay now which region you should
be using when you are deploying your
resources
so you should be deploy resource to your
nearest region now what are the
resources I'm talking about well why do
you need the cloud computing in the in
the first
place why do we need cloud computing so
cloud computing is a way of delivery of
uh uh Computing resources over the
internet right so why do we need the
Computing resources to host our
application
so if I want to host my application in
order to host an application you need a
server that server will be physically
present
somewhere right so that will be present
in one of the data center so when I
deploy application using a your portal
or any any other
way that application is physically
hosted somewhere although I can access
that application using the internet
connectivity but that application
physically is going
and get deployed in one of the data
center right now where you should be
deploying it you can deploy it anywhere
wherever the region is available
wherever that Microsoft or any other
data center any other cloud provider has
their region you can you can put your
your data or your application over there
all right now if you do not have cloud
computing and let's say you want to
serve your users sitting in United
States your user base is in United
States does it make sense to deploy or
and and keep your server in
India your user are connecting to your
application and your user base is United
States so if I ask my user sitting in
United States to connect my application
and I'm hosting my application in India
what what possibly uh issues we can face
we can face latency
issues right going via US going from us
to India there would be latency issues
and my application will not behave
properly so at the end what what issue
will be having our application is not
working properly when user are trying to
access
it so this is not the best practice I
would say so what you will be doing
you'll be deploying your resources in
United States itself so you need to
deploy your resources closest to your
user base where is your user base if
it's in India deploy your resources in
India if it's in US deploy your
resources in in in us okay so it
provides you the flexibility and
scalability so you can deploy anywhere
you want but the recommended way is to
deploy it closest to your user wherever
your user is deploy closer to
them okay it preserves data residency so
if you have any compliance requirement
where you need to have your resources
only in India so deploy it in India AA
will not transfer the data Beyond
India okay Global Services so with the
help of cloud computing we can deploy
Services anywhere so any user from any
part of the world can access my
application so if I have user base all
around the world what I can do I can
have one instance of my application in
India one instance in us one instance in
Australia wherever you have your user
base you can deploy your application if
data center is present over there all
right all the regions are paired with
each other just to make sure that you
are not losing your data just to make
sure that you can achieve High
availability okay so in order to achieve
High availability we need to make sure
we have more than one instances which
are
deployed all right so this is the link
from where you can access the uh AO
Globe where you can see all the regions
all the available region yep so you see
these are the regions you can also see
the map instead of
globe it is quite heavy application I
mean it will utilize you a lot of
resources so it's better to go to the
map instead of globe if you see over
here these are all the regions the
global compliance and all okay so you
can see all the regions wherever we have
the regions so if you see India over
here you have Central India you have
South India and somewhere here you
should have West India but it's not uh
visible because Central India and West
India are quite quite nearer to each
other and this is is the new region that
they have announced India South Central
it's still not up but it will it will
come up uh soon as for them okay there
are lot of regions how many regions they
have I don't have a proper answer but if
you count you you should see you should
see or if you go to Microsoft
documentation you should see okay so as
of now I don't know when was this
updated so if I just search for it as of
now it's showing as 60 regions
so we have 60 regions 60 plus as per
co-pilot right so you have 60 regions
around the globe so if you go to any of
the Microsoft documentation you should
get an exact
answer okay so if you read the
documentation from Microsoft somewhere
you should get an exact
answer if they have mentioned right and
the last uh point that I mention over
here is region pair so every
region is paired with another region
just to make sure that your data is not
lost okay so if you see
India Central
India uh West India and uh South India
all these regions are paired with each
other so Central India is paired with
South
India Central India again is paired with
West India and then West India is paired
with South India right so these are all
the regions which are paired with each
other now why Azor has done that so uh
we need to make sure that what happens
see uh if I'm deploying my application
in central India so this application
goes on Central India Central India is
nothing but Pune so in pune's data
center my application is being hosted
now if there's some natural calamities
or there is some power failure in the
data center what is going to happen to
my
application even though you are using
cloud computing your application will go
down since physically the data center is
not available if data center is not
available I cannot access my application
so you should you could lose uh business
if you if you're making money from your
application so in order to avoid that
what you can do you can deploy one
instance in central India one instance
in South India so if Central India goes
down you can route your traffic to South
India so that's why they have make uh
they have made a paired region so every
region is paired with another
region just to make sure so you can have
uh High availability you can design High
availability by default there will not
be high availability you need to design
it right so if you're planning to design
High availability you need to deploy one
instance over here one instance in the
second region so if one region entire
region or data center is uh going down
you still have your application up and
running from from another
region all right so that's why if you if
you just go ahead and see all other all
the regions are paired with each
other South Africa we have two regions
north and west so they are paired China
we have multiple regions so they are
paired with each other okay it's been
paired so that you can design it by your
by deploying multiple instances it's not
by default if I only select one instance
and if I'm deploying over by default
Azor is not replicating your data okay
by default it will not do that when it
comes to the resources now we have
understood what regions are so regions
are nothing but the physical location
physical data centers whatever data
center aor has created Microsoft has
created you can deploy your application
or your resources over there all right
now in order to deploy a resources first
of all you need AO subscription if you
do not have Subs subcription you cannot
deploy any resource Now understand the
difference over here between tenant and
subscription so you have an A your
tenant with you that tenant is nothing
but a dedicated instance to your
organization all right tenant is a
dedicated instance to your organization
with tenant what I'm getting I'm getting
a directory where you can create your
users you can manage your users you can
modify your users you can delete your
users you can create thousands of users
as per your subscri as per your plan as
per your
addition uh your active direct your
Microsoft entra ID Edition all
right but this users will not be able to
deploy resources unless you buy an AO
subscription in order to deploy
resources I need the subscription in
place if I don't have the subscription I
cannot deploy any resources all right
now let me just give give you a quick
overview on the on the portal itself if
I go to the portal and if I search for
subscription
now you see if I click on subscription
over here so this is the subscription
that simply learn has already
bought I need to have this subscription
if I don't have the subscription I
cannot deploy the resource so let me
just show you a quick
example I click on diss over here I
search for dis I'm just showing you that
I have the subscription if I have the
subscription I'm being landed to this
particular page and I can create a
resource so disk is nothing but a
resource over here you consider this as
your hard disk
okay now the third option that it is
asking is a region so I can deploy it
anywhere I want if you scroll down you
have options to all the
regions right so let's select whatever
you want if I want India I can search
for India so these are the three regions
we have in India so I can select
whatever region I want once I have
selected the region I can change the
size just to make sure
that I'm not being
charged any resource you deploy uh
you'll have to pay all right so that's
why I'm getting very uh low resource and
I click on review
create and then I click on create so my
resource is getting deployed see here
you just need to understand that I can
deploy resource now why I can deploy
resource because I have access to the
subscription if I do not have
subscription I will not be able to
deploy the resource so here your
takeaway is you just need to uh
understand here that in order to deploy
any resource you need to have
subscription in place all right now
let's so you see resource is deployed
now this is the resource that I have
deployed now let's go back to the enter
ID and create a user
do we have user 01 or I deleted it so if
I go back to the deleted
users yeah so let's restore user
01 and let's try to log in with user 01
okay so I just copy the user principal
name I go to the uh incognito
window i s sign out from my root cloud
account and I log in from the user 01
account that we created right so I'm
just using the user 01 name clicking on
next and I'm providing the
password so what I'm trying to show you
over here is that can user
01 deploy a resource so if I search for
this I searching the same uh resource
that I deployed with other user but as
you can
see I search for disk
but it
is I have been landed or I have been
redirected back to this page if I search
for virtual
machine if I click on it I'm again
coming back to this page why why is that
so because this user does not have
access to
subscription so in order to deploy
resources you need subscription in place
if you do not have subscription you
cannot deploy any resource whatever
resource you search for you won't be
able to deploy it since we do not have
the subscription over
here whatever resource I
select you see I'm landed back to the
same
page okay so you need to deploy the re
in order to deploy the resources we need
access to the subscription what is the
subscription subscription is nothing but
the billing boundary where AO will
charge you so no M doesn't matter how
what resource you are deploying will
charge you by seeing at your
consumption right an example of if you
want an electricity if you want to use
electricity you need the connection to
uh you need to apply for the connection
and then you get your uh get electricity
delivered to your home right and then
you whatever you'll be using they'll see
how how they see that you have a meter
so they they take the reading every
month and then send you the
bill right so similarly here Azure will
provide you the subscription and
whatever you'll be used whatever your
usage is according to your usage you'll
have to pay so what is subscription
subscription is nothing but the billing
boundary you can have as many
subscriptions as you want there's no
limitation right uh you can deploy
resources into your subscription and
according to your usage Azia will charge
you got it what are the different types
of subscription and where you can get
the subscription so yesterday I showed
you how you can create create a free
tier account so one of the type of
subscription is free tier another type
is pay as you go free tier is will give
you just 30 days of free credit and you
can use those credit for 30 days all
right pay as you go is like the amount
of resources you are deploying according
to that you'll be charged so pay as you
go according to your consumption you'll
be have you'll be paying right another
type of subscription is cloud service
Partners so you can buy subscription
from uh from Microsoft Partners right
from from them you can buy the
subscription and if you're buying and if
you're using lot of resources they could
provide you the offers as well
Enterprise subscription again you can
get that from uh Enterprise agreement
with Microsoft you can go on an
Enterprise agreement with Microsoft so
if you if you become Microsoft partner
they'll give you an Enterprise level of
subscription all right and the other one
is is uh student all right so these are
the types of
subscription and where to get this
subscription from you can directly buy
it from Microsoft by going into an
Enterprise agreement uh you can buy it
from resellers there are there are
various Cloud resellers that that's
mentioned over here Cloud uh selling
partner or cloud services partner you
can buy it from Microsoft Partners as
well or you can create your personal
free account okay so these are the four
different ways of buying a subscription
now if you want to buy a if you want to
enroll for the pay as you g pay as you
go or or or free subscription you can do
that from here only if I go back to the
uh to the page the portal where I have
logged in from user 01 you see the first
option that you getting over
here is nothing but start with an AO
free trial so if you're eligible you can
you can create a free trial but again
again you need uh credit card you need
to provide the credit card and you need
to provide a email address that you have
not you have not used earlier all right
so I can click on start and it will take
me to the start page and from here I can
create a free tier account right this is
the free tier apart from that what other
subscriptions you can buy okay you can
access student benefits as well so if
you're student you need to provide your
student account but only certain uh
University
who are partner with Microsoft only only
for them you you get the student
benefits right it's not for every all
the universities only for few
universities right apart from that if I
go over here and if I search for
subscription you can add from AA portal
as well so if you search for
subscription over here you'll be landed
to this page and in this page you can
click on ADD and you can add a
subscription so there are different
different types of subscription you see
free trial pay as you go for students
you can explore our other offers as well
so AO provides AO pass sponsorship you
need to buy this from Microsoft Partners
okay so these are the different types
from where you can uh these are the
different ways from where you can get
the subscription all right subscription
is nothing but the billing boundary in
order to deploy any resource you need to
have subscription in place if you do not
have subscription you cannot deploy the
resource all right now I created the dis
so let me just delete that dis first
otherwise it will incur the charges so
what I'll do I'll just delete the uh the
resource that I just
created all right so let's go back to
the
uh page where we are
discussing all right so the next topic
that we have is Resource Group
right in AIO we have something called as
Resource Group so Resource Group is
nothing but a logical container where
you can keep your resources now what are
the resources resources are nothing but
virtual machine your storage
account your SQL databases your virtual
Network your disk that we just created
so these are nothing but the
resources resources are the actual
resources that you're deploying what
virtual machine it's nothing but a
server where you your application will
be
hosted you have storage account where
you can keep your files you have
databases where you can create a TBL
form at databases your schema right so
where we keep all these resources so in
order to keep all these resources you
can you can create a resource Group
first inside that Resource Group you can
create all the resources that you
want okay now why do we have this this
concept of Resource Group it's it's a
good concept it's a uh Resource Group is
something that which is not physical you
can physical in the sense which is not
tangible it's just a logical
resource all right so it's it's just a
metadata where your resources will be
you you you can keep your resources it's
like grouping your resources together
now why do we need to create a resource
Group to separate your instances
so you can use Resource Group in any any
format you want for example you are
distinguishing your resources from the
envir environment type like for example
all the production related resources
will be in one Resource Group all the
development environment related
resources will be in development
Resource
Group all the testing resources will be
in test Resource Group so you can
separate the separate your resources
like that or whatever strategy you want
to follow you can follow those
strategies for example all the resources
in India should belong to one Resource
Group all the resources in us should
belong to one Resource
Group or you can follow all the
resources similar type of resources like
all the virtual machine belongs to one
Resource Group all the network belongs
to one Resource Group so you can follow
whatever you want so Resource Group is
just the way to to keep your resources
together
all right however you want to deploy
however you want to use it you can use
it now there are a few points that you
need to understand over here what are
those Point resources can exist only in
one Resource Group that means at a time
one resource can part of only one
Resource Group that means this virtual
machine can belong to one Resource Group
at a time you can move resources between
resource Group but at a time one
resource is is part of one Resource
Group only so this VM will be under
Resource Group 01 cannot be under two
different resource
groups
okay rg01 is a resource Group under that
Resource Group we have
vm1 I can move vm1 from one Resource
Group to another that is possible but at
a particular point in time one VM will
only reside in one Resource Group not
two resource groups all right you can
have different types of resources in one
Resource Group like you have a VM over
here you have a storage you have a SQL
you have Network you have diss so
different types of resources can be part
of one Resource Group there's no
limitation on that right once you have
created the resource Group there's no
way to rename the resource Group so if I
have given the resource Group name as RG
02 I cannot rename it that's not
possible right as of now we don't have
that feature that is a limitation as of
now all right and you can move resources
from one Resource Group to another so I
can move this VM from one resource to
another one Resource Group to another
that is possibility all right so what is
a resource Group it's just a logical
container which will keep your resources
you can keep any type of resources
inside the resource now what is the
advantage of having a resource Group so
it will help you to manage your
resources efficiently so in case for
example I'm I'm creating a resource
Group for demo purpose
today and I'm deploying hundreds of
resources just for testing just for demo
purposes I'm doing
testing but if I forgot to delete this
resources what is going to happen I'll
have to pay to Microsoft because I'm you
I'm utilizing their resources so I'll
have to pay
them so what can I do at the end of the
demonstration or at the end of the
testing if I'm only doing the testing I
can simply delete this Resource Group
and whatever we have inside that
Resource Group will get
deleted I don't need to go one by one to
each and every resource and delete them
I can simply delete Resource Group and
entire all the resources will be deleted
over here so what is a resource Group
it's nothing but a logical contraer
provided by Microsoft as your which
helps you to organize and manage your
resources so you you can keep any
resource that you
want you can you can divide your
resources you can create resource grip
Resource Group on the basis of
environment like production uh
development test or you can create on
the basis of country maybe all the US
related uh all the US related resources
will be in one Resource Group all the
India related resources will be in one
Resource Group or you can do on the
basis of resources like all all the VMS
will be in one Resource Group however
you want however your management team or
you decides you will be keeping your
resources like that right what happens
it is nothing but a logical grouping uh
Resource Group resources within the
resource Group can be managed
collectively right that means if I
delete the resource Group all the
resources inside that Resource Group
will be
deleted it is helpful to do the testing
right I I'm doing the testing so I'm I'm
deploying lots of resources and at the
end of testing once once my testing is
done I simply delete the resource Group
to all the resources will be deleted
hello everyone this is Samuel and I'm
very excited that you're watching this
video and I would like to welcome you to
this Azure interview preparation session
knowing Azure is one thing having worked
on Azure is another thing and being able
to answer interview questions in Azure
is a totally different thing although
one helps the other it's still different
skills and our aim through this video is
to prepare you with common product and
scenario based interview questions so
why wait let's get started a common
Cloud interview question is what's the
difference between SAS Pas and is we all
know that a software as a service is
Thin Client model of software
provisioning where client in this case
usually is simp a web browser providing
the point of access to softwares running
on the servers now SAS is the most
familiar form of cloud service for
customers SAS moves the task of managing
software and its deployment to third
party Services meaning the vendor
actually gets to manage all that so uh
SAS is software as a service involving
applications being consumed and used by
organization so it's generally using an
application and usually organizations
pay for their use of this particular
application now some examples of SAS
would include Office 365 Salesforce is
another very good example of SAS and a
lot of uh Google Apps and Storage
Solutions like box and Dropbox are a
very good example of software as a
service talking about platform as a
service or pass it actually functions at
the lower level than SAS now typically
it provides a platform form on which
software can be developed and deployed
now here we develop the software we
deploy the software now pass actually
provides an abstract of much of the work
dealing with servers and giving client
and environment in which the operating
system and the server software and the
Hardwares the network are managed and
taken care in other words with a
platform as a service all the things
that I've mentioned like the servers the
service software the hardware everything
is managed by the provider and we can
focus on business side of the
scalability and we can focus on
application development of our product
or the service so in short platform as a
service is a service that enables
developers to build and work with
applications without even having to
worry about the infrastructure or
management of the underlying hosting
environments and some examples of uh
past and Azure is SQL and Azure storage
talking about infrastructure as a
service I as now this is moving down the
stack even further now we get to the
fundamental building block of the cloud
service which is infrastructure as a
service I now I is fully of Highly
automated scalable Computer Resources
isas is full of storage is is full of
the network capability that's what is is
now is clients have direct access to the
servers and storage just as they would
to do traditional servers but in this
case it's going to be in the cloud in
this case it's going to be more scalable
so is is very similar to what you would
do in your on premises physical data
center but when we talk about is we get
to do everything but it's stored in the
cloud so if we need to build a
definition around IAS I or
infrastructure as a service provides
users with components it provides
components it does not give us an built
environment it simply provides a
component such as operating system uh
networking capabilities and a lot more
now this is a paid for based on the
usage and can be used to host
applications in other words this is pay
as you go type the more you use the more
you pay the less you use the less you
pay and some of the examples of I in
Azure is virtual machine that's a great
example for IAS and v-ets for networking
that's another good example for IAS in
Azure another common question in Azure
interview is what are the instant types
offered by Azure the main intention of
this question is how well have you
understood the different offerings in
Azure and how well are you trained to
pick the right offering for the right
service now one size does not fit all
and there are there are a lot of
services in Azure that under the carpet
it does the same thing but depending on
how different different your requirement
is we'll have to pick the appropriate
service so this actually this question
what are the different instant types
offered by Azure it's to test how well
have you used the product and services
available in Azure and how well have you
applied them for the given requirement
you shouldn't be provisioning more you
shouldn't be provisioning less at the
same time so it's kind of matching the
right service to the right requirement
so what are the instant types offered by
Azure as you see in the list we have
general purpose computer optimized
memory optimized storage optimized GPU
virtual machines and high performance
compute virtual machines now answering
just the names won't be enough in an
interview you'll have to go further and
explain why and in What scenario you
would use general purpose and what are
the use cases what type of servers is a
good fit for a general purpose and what
type is a good fit for computer
optimized so on and so forth and that's
exactly what we're going to do now so
the general purpose VMS you know they
provide a balanced CPU to memory ratio
and it's very good for testing very good
for development environment very good
for small and medium databases and also
for low to medium traffic web servers
and some of the use cases are like we
said test servers low traffic web
servers small to medium databases some
Enterprise grade applications it's also
good for relational database it's also
good for uh servers used for inmemory
caching it's also good for some small
analytic uh database very good for
microservices and if you're trying to
build a proof of concept for an idea
that you just have or just parked uh
this is another good server for doing
proof of Concepts because you're not
going to send actual traffic to it I
just want to show that you know your
idea works so general purpose server is
a very good use case for those scenarios
and the largest instance size uh we can
get in general purpose is standard d64
V3 uh which comes with 256 GB of memory
and 1,600 GB of SSD temporary storage on
the other hand compute optimized VMS
have an a high CPU to memory ratio and
are very good for medium traffic web
servers very good for batch processing
servers very good for application
servers now because it's Compu optimized
and compute means a CPU it's an
excellent choice for workloads that
demand
faster CPU but does not need as much
memory or temporary storage virtual CPU
some of the workloads that run very well
on computer optimized are analytic
workloads uh gaming servers require more
CPU they AR really well uh batch
processing are some of the applications
that can be placed in computer optimized
and by doing that we get the actual
benefit of the computer optimized
instance and the largest instance size
or the largest instance and size type is
standard f72 V2 and here we get 144 GB
of memory and 576 GB of SSD temporary
storage in compute optimized VMS in the
same lines memory optimized to VM they
offer High memory to CPU ratio and that
are great for databases databases
require more memory so it's a great fit
for database and uh it's a great fit for
medium to
large scale caches applications that
require inmemory analytics so this
memory optimized memories more so it's
very good for inmemory analytics
applications and the largest instant
size we get here is standard M
128m and look at the um gigabit of
memory it's uh
3892 GB of memory and uh look at the uh
temporary storage it's uh 1400 uh
336 a gigabit of temporary storage on
the same lines storage optimized now I
guess I don't have to explain to you
what storage optimized is used for you
might have easily guessed looking at the
flow yes storage optimized Wim offer
High disk throughput and IO and are very
ideal for Big Data uh SQL no SQL
databases data warehousing servers large
transactional databases and lot more and
some of the examples of the applications
that can be launched on storage
optimized are Cassandra mongodb clouder
redis these are some familiar
applications that can get benefited when
we run them on storage optimized and one
difference between storage optimized and
the other servers are they are generally
optimized to use the local dis on the
Node attached directly to the VM rather
than using an durable disc which is
actually an a remote uh disk space now
what does this allow this allows for
greater input outputs per second or uh
throughput for the workload so that's
what we get a greater throughput a
greater input outputs per second is what
we get when we use storage optimized and
the largest instant size available in
storage optimized is uh standard uh l32
s and U uh the memory is 256 GB and look
at the temporary storage it's a
5630 GB of temporary storage GPU type
VMS easy to guess uh GPU optimized VMS
are specialized virtual machines
available with u multiple gpus attached
to them now these sizes are designed for
or these VMS are designed for computer
intensive graphic intensive
visualization workloads that require lot
of um graphical Processing Unit attached
to it so in short these are virtual
machines that specialize in heavy
graphic rendering and video editing it
also helps with the model training and
interfering with the standard nd24 RS
which has uh 448 GB of memory and
2948 GB of temporary storage and the
last but not the least but the best last
but the best is high performance
computer or Azure H series virtual
machines now they are the latest in high
performance Computing VMS and are aimed
to handle workloads like batch
processing analytic molecular modeling
and fluid dynamics a lot of complicated
applications in this uh VM and this is
the fastest and Powerful CPU virtual
machine with u optional High throughput
interfaces and the largest instance size
that's available is standard l32 s which
comes with 224 GB of memory and 200 GB
of SSD temporary storage and the third
common question is what are the
deployment environments offered by Azure
there are two main deployment
environments one is the staging
environment and the other one is the
production environment now in staging
environment let's talk about staging
first so when you're deploying a web app
or web app on Linux you can deploy them
to a separate slot instead of the
default production slot when running
them in standard premium or isolated app
service plan tiers now the deployment
slots are actually live app with their
own host name and at a later point the
staging environment can be swapped with
the production environment so why do we
need an staging environment what are the
benefit of it so the benefit of
deploying our application to a non
production or staging environment it
provides a platform to validate changes
to our application before it can be made
live in the production environment and
in the staging environment the app can
be identifier using the azures global
unique identifier also called as the
guid URL and it's very very similar to
the production URL except that it has an
custom name in front of it that
identifies it as the staging environment
and for production environment uh this
is the live uh production environment
that's serving customers request that's
serving the customer content now it can
be slightly different from the staging
environment in a way that the URL that's
used to identify the production
environment that's more of an DNS
friendly name like the name of the
actual
service. Cloud
app.net that way it differs in case of
staging environment you have an custom
name right before it so the custom name
and then the cloud app.net but in this
case you get the uh direct service name
as the name of the URL so this is live
production environment which receives
and handles and serves customer traffic
another commonly asked question in Azure
is what are the advantages of scaling in
Azure the actual thought behind the
question is to see how much have you
understood scaling how much have you
seen and how much have you applied the
scaling effect in the production
environment and have received benefits
in return so let's talk about it
advantages of scaling in Azure some of
the advantages are we get the maximum
application performance now autoscaling
is a built-in feature for the cloud
services be it um AWS Azure uh Google
and a couple of other cloud service
providers it's a built-in feature for a
cloud service a cloud service should be
Autos scalable and that includes mobile
services virtual machines and um when we
run our applications uh on mobile
services or virtual machines the website
actually gets the best performance uh
during the change in the demand again
different applications uh might require
different uh performance needs for
example for some apps the performance
measured based on memory and another
good example is the fluctuating demand
for example you could have a web app
that handles millions of requests during
the day and literally nothing at the
night and autoscaling this environment
autoscaling any of these environment
will automatically scale or fatten your
environment so to receive the all the
incoming traffic and during lean period
it actually gets Slimmer and Slimmer so
to help you with the cost so it actually
maximizes the performance that's what
autos scaling does and like we said Auto
scaling scales up and scales Down based
on demand it not only scales up but also
scales down so to help you with the cost
and if you know the particular pattern
in which the application is going to
receive uh traffic then we can very well
go ahead and schedule scaling to our
application or schedule scaling that
infrastructure based on time if we
already know that Monday to Friday
that's the traffic uh that I would get
and it's a constant one it's not a
public facing but you know it's an
internal application so I know all the
500 users or the th000 or the 5,000
users who will be using it so at any
given point it's just 5,000 users it's
not going to go beyond that and during
Saturday and Sunday literally nobody's
going to be in office so no load at all
so in that case I pretty much know how
the pattern is going to be I can go for
scheduled scaling if I know the pattern
and autoscaling like I said not only
helps with keeping the application
highly available it also helps with the
cost effectiveness of our infrastructure
so anytime there's a VM or a group of
VMS running on less CPU Autos scaling is
going to actually get the environment
Slimmer and Slimmer so we're not
unnecessarily running any resources and
paying for it if you're being
interviewed for the infra site in azure
this is another common question that
gets asked how are Windows Active
Directory and Azure active directory
different let's talk about the Windows
Active Directory first the non-cloud
Windows Active Directory was the service
was released along with Windows 2000
server Edition and this active directory
is essentially a database that helps
organizations to organize the users
organize the computers and a lot more it
provides authentication and
authorization to the applications not
only to the applications but also to
file servers to printers and a lot of
other on premises uh resources that's
what the basic non-cloud active
directory does on the other hand the
Azure active directory is not designed
to manage web- Based Services the Azure
active directory on the other hand was
designed to support web- Based Services
that use rest API interfaces for Office
365 salesforce.com Etc unlike the plane
active directory this uses an completely
different protocol so protocol wise it's
different and the services that it
support is quite different now besides
that it also has a couple of other
differences as well and let's look at
them so the actual active directory or
the windows actual directory is a
directory service that facilitates
working with interconnected complex and
different networker sources in a very
unified manner on the other hand Azure
active directory is Microsoft's
multi-tenant cloud-based directory and
identity management service and the
Windows Active Directory has five layers
to store data to store user details and
to issue the management certifications
on the other hand Azure active directory
integrates or compresses the five layers
into just two layers here Windows Active
Directory works with on premises servers
like applications file servers and
printers Etc on the other hand aure
active directory it uh works on web-
Based Services that use restful
interfaces if you're being hired for the
development environment or for the cloud
devops support environment or even for
the production support environment you
might find yourself being asked this
question what are the types of cues
offered by Azure now Azure supports two
types of queue mechanisms the storage
queue and the service bus queue Let's
Talk About Storage queue first now the
storage queue which are part of azure
storage infrastructure it provides a
simple rest based uh interface simple
rest based get put and Peak interface it
provides reliable persistent messaging
within and between the services it
follows the pub sub model or a pub sub
messaging infrastructure and it's best
suited for users that need to store more
than 80 GB of messages in the cube it
can provide logs for all the
transactions executed against the users
queue so that's what we get with storage
queue and on the other hand service bus
queue the service bus cues are built on
top of broader messaging infrastructure
and they are designed to integrate
applications and applications component
that can span multiple communication
protocols so that way it differs so this
is good for applications and components
that may span multiple communication
protocols and even different totally
different network environments so in
short these service buses or the service
bus cues in Azure are part of azure's
messaging infrastructure and they uh
integrate applications or application
components that can actually span
multiple different protocols and
multiple different network environments
it also provides an first in first out
style for delivery and the user Q size
has to remain under 80 gb another
familiar question is what are the
advantages of azure resource manager now
the resource manager helps us to manage
the usage of the application resources
this question is actually to test how
well have you tested how well have you
used resource manager and have gotten
the benefit of it this question actually
tests how easy it has become after the
introduction of resource manager
compared to uh when doing deployments or
when provisioning resources without the
resource manager so let's get into the
answers for the question what are the
advantages of azure resource manager the
in short resource manager is called armm
so the armm helps deploy manage and
monitor all the resources for an
application a solution or a group so all
the interconnected application all the
interconnected Services can be monitored
as group using resource manager and uh
users can be granted to access to
resources that they require within a
resource manager so in an account I can
have like 10 different resources created
by resource manager or a resource Group
created by resource managers and I can
allow deny connection to those services
or only to those Services based on
whether the user should be accessing one
and not accessing the other so that way
it becomes easy to give access to a
group of application it helps in getting
billing details for the group of
resources now which group is using more
which group is using less and which
group has contributed more to this
month's bill stuff like that so those
details can be obtained using Azure zour
manager and provisioning resources is
made much easier uh with the help of
this resource manager another question
is how has integrating hybrid Cloud
being useful for Azure well with the use
of hybrid Cloud we get the best of both
the worlds so what's hybrid Cloud it's
nothing but combining the public cloud
and the private cloud and allowing data
and applications to be shared uh between
them so whenever the compute or the
processing demand fluctuates hybrid
cloud computing gives businesses the
ability to to seamlessly scale their on
premises infrastructure in the public
cloud and handle any kind of uh overflow
in the requirement or overflow in
handling the application so it really
helps it helps it boost the productivity
of our on premises application so with
the hybrid Cloud we get a greater
efficiency with combination of azure
services at devops processes and tools
for the application running in on
premises and and by having an hybrid
Cloud environment users can take
advantage of a constantly updated Azure
service and other AWS Marketplace um
applications for their on premises
environment and the other benefit is uh
with hybrid Cloud environment we can
simply deploy applications regardless of
its locations in case of on premises
we'll have to worry about the location
but when we expand our on premises
environment in the cloud and they can or
we can pick any of the locations and
simply deploy it in them and this
enables the applications to be created
at a greater speed what's federating in
Azure SQL now this question is very
specific about SQL how can we scale the
SQL database now this is a very good
question or a valid question or an
important question in the interview
because many customers or companies have
not been able to meet the user demand
because they could not scale out uh the
databases uh the theory of scaling out
out or adding servers to accommodate the
increased workflows and traffic is not
hard to understand but uh the
implications can be very complicated the
implications can be very expensive we
well aware of scaling the web servers
that's very common but how do we scale
the database so Microsoft provides the
tools and Technologies so we can scale
out the database in the cloud and that's
what is called SQL or Federation in
Azure SQL so the way we scale out the
SQL database is by shing shing the
database so Shing actually enables users
to take advantages of the resources in
the cloud not only that it allows users
to have their own database or shared
database amongst each other because we
creating an highly available database
because we're having shards in a
database it actually reduces the
possibility of a single point of failure
for our database and more importantly
because we're sharting uh because we're
using Federation and Azure SQL it
provides an cost effective scaling of
our databases by using Cloud resources
or by using billing only for the cloud
resources that we have used so no
pre-provisioning no over provisioning it
Provisions the right amount and we pay
the right amount let's talk about this
one what are the different types of
storage offered by Azure now the
different types of storage offered by
Azure are as you already know and as you
can see they are azure blob storages
table storages file storage and Q
storage so let's expand one after the
other now blob storage are nothing but a
massive scalable object storage and
that's very good for storing text and
binary data and asure blob storage is a
a Microsoft's object storage solution
for the cloud blob storage is optimized
for storing massive massive amount of
unstructured data that can be in form of
text or or in form of Bin data so in
short blob storage enables users to
store unstructured data and those data
can be in the format of pictures music
video files and lot more and it stores
them along with their metadata and
another advantage or another feature
benefit that we get from blob storage is
when object is changed it is verified to
ensure it is of the latest version
number one and number two it provides
maximum flexibility to optimize the user
storage needs and this unstructured data
is available to customers through an URL
or an rest based object storage so they
are the benefits that come along with
The Blob storage table storage on the
other hand is an a nosql store for
schema Less storage of secured data now
this Azure table storage is a service
that stores uh structured no SQL data in
the cloud and because this table is a
schema less it's very easy to save your
data it's very easy to adapt your uh
data data as the need for your
application grows and this table storage
is very fast and cost effective for many
type of applications so some of the some
of the type of data that we can store is
U table storage is good for flexible
databases like user data for web
applications address book storage device
information storage and if you want to
store metadata this is a very good use
case to store them in Azure table
storage Azure files is another storage
here it's an managed file share for
cloud or on premises uh deployment so
file storage provides a file sharing
capabilities accessible by the server
messaging block protocol and this can be
accessed from the cloud and this can be
accessed from on premises as well uh
here in file storage the data is
protected by SMB uh 3.0 and hdps uh
protocols and the more important thing
is azure takes care of managing Hardware
and the operating system deployments for
Azure file storage so this additional
file storage can be used uh when we want
to burst the storage capacity in on
premises so on- premises the primary and
cloud is the secondary or the extended
on premises storage so it actually
improves the on premises performance and
capabilities for our on premises Data
Center and then we have cues Azure cues
it's a messaging store for Reliable
messaging between the application
components we spoke a little about this
uh in the previous question so the Azure
Q storage is a service for storing a
large amount of messages that can be
accessed from anywhere in the world via
HTTP or htps uh protocol in here the uh
a single message can be up to 64
kilobits in size and in a queue we can
have millions of messages and the limit
can actually go up if we have not
reached the limit of the storage account
so it's millions and millions of
requests that can be stored in the
storage que or the Q storage so the Q
storage in short uh provides message
queuing for large workloads and it
enables users to build flexible
applications and separate the functions
one from another so one failing doesn't
affect the other application which is
running healthy and this Q storage it
ensures the application is scalable and
less prone to individual component uh
failures because they are decoupled
separate now it also helps in monitoring
the queue which ensures the customers
demands are met so Q is a great place to
monitor or a great component to monitor
so we understand um how much a peak can
be reached for a particular application
service or a container what is text
analysis API in Azure machine learning
now a text analysis is actually an
cloudbased analytics API and it provides
an advanced Ed natural language
processing over the raw text and it has
got four main functions like the
sentiment analysis or and the key phrase
analysis language uh deduction and and a
few other things now what do you mean by
sentiment analysis now sentiment
analysis is from the logs from the
commments from the text comments that we
receive do an analysis and find out
whether that's an positive or an
negative statement now if it is a the
API the API returns and sentiment score
between 0 and one and one is positive
and 0er is negative and then in text
analysis we have a key phrase extraction
which is it will automatically extract
the key phrase to uh quickly identify
the main points in that uh key phrase
for example if you're analyzing an text
which says the food was delicious and
there were wonderful stuff then the API
Returns the main talking points of that
phrase like food food is the main
talking point and wonderful staffs that
was a main talking point so that's
another feature that this uh text
analysis has and then we have language
deduction in text analysis right
irrespective of what you paste it can
try to gauge and try to align it to the
120 or up to 120 languages that it
supports so I can simply take text from
the internet and I can paste it and text
analysis software is going to identify
the language and then can run phrase and
sentiment analysis on those text right
so in short text analysis is an API a
set of web services that can be used for
text analysis it can be used to analyze
unstructured statement sentiment
analysis keyphrase extraction and lot
more and the results are generally
between 0o and one and one being
positive and zero being the negative
sentiment there is no much training or
in other words this is not as
complicated as couple of other text
analysis softwares are available in the
market we can simply paste we can simply
upload the text and we can call the
service and it runs a sentiment analysis
on it all by itself let's look at this
question what are the advantages of
azure Q storage if you're going to work
in a development environment if you're
going to work in an environment that
Embraces devops this could be a question
what are the advantages of a your Q
storage now Azure Q storage is built to
flexibly operate the applications and
separate the functions between the
applications that run large workloads so
when we design applications for scale
these applications can be decoupled so
that they can scale independently you
know a thing happening on an application
is not dependent on another application
and anything happens to an section of
the application will not affect the
other application because they are now
decoupled and connected through the Q
storage so the Q storage gives us
asynchronous message queuing for
communication between the applications
irrespective of whether they are running
in the cloud or whether they are running
in desktop or whether they are running
on premises or on mobile devices so in
short this queue storage enables message
queuing for large workloads in a simple
and cost effective and a durable manner
talking about the advantages advantages
is it provides Rich client libraries for
Java Android C++ PHP rubby and a lot
other services getting added during
every new release from Azure and the
main advantage again is it enables users
to build flexible apps and uh separate
the functions for bigger or greater
durability again introduction of cues
into our application it ensures our
users application ations are scalable
and less prone to individual component
failures meaning one component failing
is not going to take the whole
application down right if one component
fails it's just that component that
stays fails the rest are healthy and the
rest are going to function it also helps
us to monitor the cues and ensure the
servers are overhelmed by sudden traffic
burst so how much do I have in the queue
uh kind of determines uh the traffic for
my application and if the a q is more I
can always go and autoscale my
environment and the Q is less I can
always go and Shrink or make my
environment thinner so it can save cost
and anytime there is more data in the
queue I can Auto scale monitor the
metric and do auto scaling based on that
metric so the environment knows that
there are more datas coming in I need to
expand myself to handle that much amount
of data this is a very common question
what are the two kinds of azure web
service roles now as service role is a
set of managed and load balanced virtual
machines that work to perform some task
and based on what it's going to run on
top of it is it going to run web service
or is it going to run worker service
defines what kind of roles that gets
attached or that goes on this virtual
machines so we have two types web roll
and worker roles the web roll is a cloud
service role that's configured to run
web applications developed on
programming languages Technologies and
majorly they support U IAS internet
information service and they support uh
asp.net PHP uh Windows communication
foundation and so on so that's web roles
and these web roles it automatically
deploys and hosts application through
the users IIs internet information
service on the other hand worker roles
are roles that uh runs applications and
service level tasks which generally do
not require I so is is actually the
differentiating factor so in worker
roles is is not installed by default the
worker roles are mainly used to perform
supporting background process along with
web roles and do tasks automatically
compressing or uploading the images
running scripts and um or doing some
changes in the database getting new
messages from the que and processing and
lot more you know the work the
applications are the work that does not
require IAS that's what this worker role
does again the main difference between
the web Ro and the worker role is that
the web Ro automatically deploys and
host your application through I whereas
the worker role does not use I and runs
our application as Standalone this is
another classic question what is azure
service fabric so Azure service fabric
is actually a distributed system
platform that makes it easy to pack
deploy and manage a scalable and
reliable microservices and containers
now service fabric also addresses some
of the significant challenges in
developing and managing Cloud native
applications and the problem that IT
addresses and fixes is now developers
and administrators can avoid complex
infrastructure problems and focus on
implementing Mission critical and
demanding workloads that can be scaled
and that can be managed through the
console or from the single place in
short service fabric provides a platform
that makes the process of develop veling
microservices and managing application
life cycle lot easier and the advantages
of service fabric is that now we can
produce application with faster time to
Market because all the worry about the
infrastructure is taken away from us we
don't have to design an infrastructure
all that we need to worry about is
simply the application and the
application life cycle again the
advantage is it supports uh Windows it
supports Linux not only that it supports
servers on premises and in the cloud
with service fabric we can scale up our
environment to even thousand machines in
just a single command or if there is a
immediate need for 1,000 machines I can
immediately scale them up to th000
machines that's possible with service
fabric now let's look at this question
you can expect this question if the
customer is running hybrid environment
meaning having some of the applications
and on premises and running some of the
applications from the cloud and for some
reason when classifying the application
that goes to the cloud and that stays on
premises they have decided to keep the
database inhouse so in that environment
a lot of customers do that so in that
environment this is a classic and a
scenario based question a client wants
the front end of their application to be
hosted on Azure in the cloud and wants
the database to be hosted in on premises
for security reasons or to have full
control on their databases how do we go
about suggesting a solution for this
customer the ideal solution in this
scenario is to use um the v-net based
point to site VPN solution so all the
frontend applications will be in the
cloud and they'll be hosted in a vet and
from the vet they'll be connecting to
the database through an point to site
VPN so the traffic and the writings and
the reads are not coming through the
internet but through a point to site VPN
link that's connecting the Azure vet and
the on premises environment and this uh
model or this approach or this solution
is best suited for scenarios where there
are only a limited number of resource
that needs to be connected between on
premises and the cloud this is a very
common question what's Azure traffic
manager of course we no more running
applications on a single server we nor
more running applications on or or from
a single environment right the same
application is being run from multiple
environments within Azure and it can be
running from Azure and on premise as
well so multiple environments between
Azure and on premises and a lot of
customers have such environment and if
you're facing an interview with such
customer this could be an ideal question
what is azure traffic manager now the
Azure traffic manager is a dns-based
traffic load balancer that actually
enables us to distribute traffic between
Services across Azure Global regions and
by doing this it provides a good
availability and a good responsiveness
to the application and this traffic
manager it uses DNS to direct client
requests to the most appropriate service
endpoint based on the traffic routing
logic and the health of the end points
that it maintains so in short this
traffic manager is a load balancer that
enables users to provide High
availability and responsiveness by
Distributing traffic in an optimal
manner across the Azure when we run the
same application in different regions so
some of the advantages or some of the
use cases of using Azure traffic manager
is it provides multiple automatic
failover options it also helps with
reduced downtime it also helps with the
distribution of user traffic across
multiple locations so one location is
not overloaded and then it helps with
the users knowing from where our
customers are getting connected from
that's another big use case with Azure
traffic manager let's look at this
question right this is an ideal question
now there are group of servers connected
together within an virtual uh Network
and now we need to move them or create a
separation between them how do you go
about achieving it so the question goes
like this you need to isolate Network
traffic among VMS in a subnet which is
part of a virtual network with little
downtime and impact on the user so
that's the given scenario and the best
way we can uh do it is create a new
virtual Network and move all the VMS in
that subnet to the new virtual ual
Network now this feature is not possible
with a lot of other cloud service
providers like AWS and a lot of other
providers now in those environments we
might need to shut down we might need to
stop the VM create a new VM based on the
image and it's an Hefty process but here
in Azure I can simply move the VMS from
one subnet to another virtual Network
without needing for any additional
security like the network security group
I can simply isolate them if I need to
by creating a simple new virtual Network
and moving the servers to the new
virtual Network look at this one this is
another common question with respect to
Azure what is public private and hybrid
Cloud so this is really to test how well
have you understood the different Cloud
offerings in the market public private
and hybrid or at least the three basic
offerings in the market public private
and hybrid Cloud now the public cloud is
the most common way of deploying cloud
uh Computing applications and uh it has
resources like uh servers storage and
are owned and operated by third- party
cloud service providers like Microsoft
Azure Microsoft Azure is a very good
example of public Cloud so here every
component that the user is using is
running only on Azure that's public
Cloud right let me talk to you about
some of the advantages of public Cloud
some of the advantages is low cost
because there's no need to purchase
Hardware or software and we pay only for
the services that we use in public cloud
and there is literally no maintenance
because uh the service provider
maintains the environment for us and uh
with public Cloud we have nearly
unlimited scalability meaning we can get
resources on demand and can meet our
business requirements on demand and the
public clouds are very highly reliable
because uh they have a vast network of
servers and they ensure that uh our
application does not fail so there are
some advantages of public Cloud let's
talk about private Cloud now private
Cloud uh consists of computer resources
used extensively by one business or one
organization now this private Cloud can
be physically located at our
organizations on site data center or it
can be hosted by a third party service
provider whichever the case the private
cloud services and infrastructure are
always maintained on a private Network
and they maintained on hardware and
software that are dedicated solely for
one organization or solely for your
organization so in short private cloud
in Azure is azure Services being run
within an on premises data center or on
premises Data Center used by the user to
host systems or applications and some of
the advantages some of the advantages is
it gives more security resources are not
shared with others so higher level of
control and security over over our
resource and application is possible and
then we have hybrid Cloud now hybrid
cloud is the best of both worlds so it
combines the features of both public and
private cloud and some of the user
components are being run on Azure and
others within on premises data center so
they kind of share the resources in
other words they kind of share the
application half of the application
would be running in on premises and half
of them would be in the cloud and they
will be working in harmony to support
the application and the business need so
that's hybrid Cloud this is one another
good example question that wants to test
how well you pick services or how well
have you understood Azure products and
services and are picking the right
service for the need so the question
would go like this what kind of storage
is best suited to handle unstructured
data there are a lot of storage options
available and the requirement here is
what or which one would you choose for
unstructured data the answer for that
question is blob storage because blob
storage is designed to support
unstructured data it works in this way
it places the data into different tiers
based on how often they are accessed
different tier means different
performance different performance means
different cost associated with it so a
lot of add-on advantages will we get
when we use blob storage for
unstructured data in addition to it any
type of unstructured data can be stored
in Blob storage this is not true with
couple of other storage options that we
have we have an Azure only with blob
storage we can uh store any type of
unstructured data and the data Integrity
is maintained every time an object is
changed in the blob storage and the best
part is the blob storage helps increase
applications performance and reduces the
bandwidth consumption and reduces the
bandwidth consumption for that
application so they are the benefits
that we get for blob storage and blob
storage are the ones that are well
suited for unstructured data and that's
what your answer should be it's really
an five-step process and if you have
worked and if you have done some Labs
some basic Labs with Azure you can
easily answer this question so it's a
five-step process first step is to log
into the Azure the second one is to
create an uh resource resource or a
resource manager and within the resource
manager you would be selecting the
resource and then pick the uh offering
system do you want windows or Linux and
within Windows what's the flavor you
want or within Linux what's the flavor
you want so decide on it and then uh
entering the relevant information
relevant information like the U uh name
of the uh instance or the VM that we're
going to launch and the password uh the
URL that goes with it and couple of
other relevant information that goes
gets itself attached with the uh VM and
then select the size of the virtual
machine different size different uh
types available for the kind of
application and for the intensity of the
application that will be running on top
of it so select the virtual select the
size of the virtual Ma machine review
everything whether they're good or not
if there are any changes required go
back and edit them and then come back
and launch and your VM is there for you
to start working within like 3 or 4
minutes not even 5 minutes within 3 or 4
minutes it gets ready and you can start
working on it so it's a quick and it's a
fstep process and you should be able to
answer it easily if you have done a few
labs in Azure let's now look at some
scenario based question you've been
posted with a scenario
so we thought through it and we picked
some common scenario based question that
are being asked in interview and I
thought we'll present it for you with
answers with explanation so you can get
benefited through it so let's look at
this question you're asked to make sure
your virtual machines are able to
communicate securely with each other to
ensure security or to have good amount
of security what would you do and the
correct and the best answer for this
would be using virtual Network in aure
which enables us to communicate with the
internet securely which enables us to
communicate with the on premises data
center in a secure fashion so the
advantage of using virtual uh network is
users can create their own private
Network users can pick their own private
IP ranges users can create their own
subnet users can create their own
routing between those two subnets a lot
more goes into that virtual Network so
it it's very customizable and the users
are provided with an isolated and highly
secure environment for applications it's
completely isolated from other customers
it's completely isolated from other
applications that are running in other
virtual Network that we own So within
our account we can have multiple virtual
networks and one application running on
a virtual machine is completely isolated
from other applications running on other
virtual machines and uh of course all
traffic stays within the Azure Network
Azure virtual machine or within the
Azure Network depending on how you set
up the routing if you have set up
routing to go or reach the Internet it's
going to go otherwise it's going to stay
within Azure if you have set up routing
to reach on premises then it's going to
go and reach on premises otherwise it's
not going to go and reach on premises
it's going to stay within the Azure and
it also allows users to design their own
network like we already discussed
picking up IPS picking routing you know
picking subnets you know how many
servers should be present in that uh
particular subnet or how many servers
should that subnet accommodate the size
of the subnet the IP ranges the nting
the masking of ips creating of VPN all
that's possible with the virtual Network
so it really allows users to design
their own network and using virtual
machine is how we secure applications in
the cloud let's look at this other
scenario how do you ensure that every
time a user logs in they are not on must
to re-enter the password as part of
authentication so you really don't want
your users to re-enter the password
every time they log in to a different
application well all the applications
have their authentication mechanism in
place all of them wants to authenticate
the user before the log in ensuring the
user does not log in every time does not
mean that wiping away all the
authentication and authorization that's
present in that application you still
need that in place but how do you make
the user hasslefree so they're not asked
to re-enter the password or the same
password again and again let's look at
the options available the first one is
to enable Microsoft account
authentication well it's not going to
fix because with that the user will
still need to re-enter the username and
password uh deploy express route uh it's
not going to fix either because express
route is a network level service that
connects on premises to the cloud so
that has got nothing to do with
prompting or not prompting for password
and then we have uh set up VPN between
on premises Data Center and Azure set up
ad domain controller in VM and Implement
integrated Windows authentication well
uh you can use the same username and
password for on premises and the cloud
but this setup the the VPN and the ad
controller setup it's not going to stop
you asking for repeative passwords so
this is all about um using the same
password in on premises and in the cloud
and this has got nothing to do with the
U not prompting the user to re-enter the
password all right so that's same
password is different from not prompting
the user to re-enter the password they
are two different scenarios so U that is
also out of the equation and the last
one is configure ad sync to use single
sign on that's the right one so when we
configure the ad to use a single sign on
then uh it's going it's not going to ask
for the username and password every time
we access an application because we have
logged in and that login is going to
stay active for like 24 hours or so
depending on how you configure it and
within that time you can access a lot of
other applications and it's not going to
ask for the username and password
because you already have a single signed
on and you have signed in using the
right credentials let's look at this one
you need to ensure that virtual machines
remain available while migrating to
Azure what would be the appropriate
service to use right let's look at the
options traffic manager traffic manager
is um is literally an DNS service and
then let's look at the other one update
domains it again has to do with traffic
manager updating the URL so the traffic
manager gets updated and then start
sending request to that particular uh
URL it's going to take some downtime
because when we update the URL they will
have to be populated to all different
places and it takes time so within that
time any user trying to access it's
going to fail and then we have express
route and cloud services express route
could be the in fact it's the right
answer because express route it's an
extension of her on premises and Cloud
environment and in this question it
really comes out from a customer who's
having an hybrid environment so they
have applications running in on premises
they have applications running in the
cloud and they want to have a way to
migrate applications from on premises to
the cloud in other words kind of do a
cut over between on premises and the
cloud and this express route is a
service that connects between on
premises and the cloud uh so when you do
the cut over the traffic is now sent to
the cloud instead of being handled in on
premises in fact the services and the
application is getting down are getting
shut down in on premises so the request
will come in the same pattern instead of
they being handled in on premises they
are now routed to the cloud using
express route and the API calls get
addressed or the the queries get it's
answered uh in the cloud through the
express route service look at this
question you are an administrator for a
website called Web game and you're
required to validate and deploy changes
made to your website by your development
team with minimum downtime so the real
question is how do you validate the
deployment changes that's made by the
development team let's look at the
options create a new linked resource
create a staging environment for the
site enable remote debug in on the
website and then create a new website
well why would you want to create a new
website just to validate the changes and
doing a remote debugging is not going to
help because debugging only captures
logs of the changes happening it does
not do anything with validating the
changes create a staging environment
could be or is the right answer because
when we have staging environments
anything that we run on production can
be run on staging environment and any
failures that would happen happen in
production if we simply run it in
production can be captured when we run
the application in the staging
environment so that way staging
environment is a very helpful and useful
service and that way I can catch of any
errors in other words I can validate the
changes that were done by my development
team uh before I move it to production
and that reduces the downtime in the
production environment look at this one
last question that we have for you it's
um a standard tier application is used
used across the world and uses Azure
website standard tier it uses large
amount of image files so you can get it
this could be an e-commerce website
which has a lot of pictures in it and
this is causing the application to load
slow how can we handle this situation
let's look at the options given
configure blob storage with custom
domain well this application has
pictures but the pictures only the
pictures is not all that the application
has all right so configuring blob
storage might not to help this could be
an very interactive website and that
can't be run from blob storage let's
look at the other options configure
Azure website autoscaling to increase
instances at high loads now it's the
picture that's causing issues for the
website it's not the CPU or it's not the
memory unavailable memory not enough
that's causing the application to be
slow so we need to identify what's
causing the application to be slow so
it's not the CPU it's not the memory so
configure Azure for Autos scaling is not
going to help and then what are the
other options let's see configure Azure
CDN to cach all responses from the
application's web endpoint CDN could be
the right answer but look at that it
says uh CDN to cach all responses from
the applications web endpoint CDN is not
designed for that though it can do it
that's not the best way to use CDN to
capture all responses from the
applications web endpoint the proper
design for CDN would be to Cache the
frequently used ones in other words cach
the static content which are photos
videos logos and pictures and lot more
static content that never changes let's
look at the last option configure Azure
CDN to Cache site images and content
stored in Azure blop storage absolutely
correct so here we will have to redesign
the application uh to store the pictures
high quality lazy loading or slow
loading pictures because of the high
quality and the bigger size so so store
them in CDN and then the content let it
be stored in Azure blob storage that's
the right way of Designing the
application and if we do it this
application is going to run faster or
the application is going to respond
faster to the users well done on

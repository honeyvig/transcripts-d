- It's lunchtime,
and this is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
Here in Redmond, we're visited by some of
the smartest people on the
planet pretty much every day.
Every chance I get, I meet
up with them for lunch.
In this week's episode,
it's the second half
of my conversation with Mark Gregory,
the CIO of Premera Blue Cross.
So in the next kind of
three to four year horizon,
if you think about healthcare in general,
what do you think the biggest
challenge is from a technology
and digital disruption
perspective you need to focus on?
- From the healthcare system overall,
there's a lot of fragmentation of data
and information out there,
and I think if we have
a collective mission to
make healthcare work better,
and it is Premera's mission to
make healthcare work better,
but expand that across the
whole healthcare industry.
We've gotta do a better job of
sharing information and sharing data,
clearly, in a secure way.
- Sure.
- In a way that benefits, ultimately,
the patient and the consumer.
It comes down to how do
you empower patients.
Remember the four
problems we talked about.
How do we address those four problems,
and we empower our customers to get
the information they need
in the most convenient way,
not convenient for us,
but convenient for them.
Earlier this year, we
brought a capability online,
well it's kind of internal,
but we signed a contract
at the end of the year and the capability
was up and running in six weeks.
- Wow.
- You know,
when you do that stuff on premise,
it's not only slower, but it
carries more weight with it.
- Yeah, sure.
- And so we see a lot of
options for us utilizing the Cloud.
- I like how you describe that, weight,
'cause that weight often slows you down
and it decreases your
agility, and it's funny,
you didn't mention once there about cost.
The Cloud, really the benefits are
agility, the flexibility, and speed.
- So, we push costs,
when we introduced Cloud
to the organization, we did not
introduce it as a cost play.
We introduced it as a value play really.
Right, so how quickly can I bring up
the capabilities that move
the organization forward.
I don't see it as a cost play.
- That's the way we look at it, too.
- It's just, I wanna bring it
up, lighter, quicker, faster,
and then I want more options with it.
I think my role is no different
than any other Senior Executive role.
I happen to be responsible for technology,
but every other Senior Exec is
responsible for driving the culture.
From my standpoint,
it's how do I make sure
that technology is aligned to
what we're doing on the business side,
not only aligned, but
pushing the business.
You know, we like to say
enabling the business,
but if technology is doing its job,
- It's pushing.
- It's pushing the business.
We're challenging business as much
as business is challenging us.
- Well, this has been awesome.
Hey, thank you so much, Mark.
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah, we'll see ya, thanks again.

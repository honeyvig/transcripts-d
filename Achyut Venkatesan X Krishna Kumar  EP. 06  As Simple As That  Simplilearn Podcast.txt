aut I'm currently working as senior
audit manager from standard charted bank
I have about 20 years of experience I'm
basically native of Chennai Tamil Nadu
born brought up and did my schooling my
college and right through my career I've
been in chenai alone so I could be a
person who could be branded as a loyal
person to his her her hometown that's
that's about me so as my childhood is
concerned I as I said I was born in
Chennai but for the first few years I
was brought up in Mangalore my father
was working in kukos he was in HR in
kukos so first three years of my life
was there but those three years a lot of
people will say that how do you remember
those three years but I do remember
those three years very vividly the
scenaries in which the Mangalore is set
up and the quarters the kud quarters it
was all wonderful then came into Chennai
did my schooling from marishi till my
10th and then I did my schooling from da
map 11th and 12 and four years I did it
from Anala University I did it in
Bachelor's of Engineering in electrical
electronics came back to Chennai I did
my MBA in finance and systems SSN School
of Management which is basically was
Affiliated to my
University and then I started off my
career in a fintech company in
2003 and it's almost yeah as I said it's
20 years since I began my career and my
life has thought a lot and I'm I'm
willing to share as much as possible
with you Krishna so thanks a and thanks
for taking a time to talk to through
your early childhood and all your
education so you you said that you still
remember the first three years that's in
that indeed very surprising because most
people don't remember but I just
realized that your father was working in
kuduk what is it is called k i o That's
encountered because I studied in n and
and that company was not very far away
from our college so we do used to visit
that campus once in a while and weed by
all the facility that
particular like the township had right
and I'm sure is beautiful right so there
is no anybody who goes there will like
it for sure right yeah but the company
is now I I would say I think the iror is
still is not mind anymore so the company
is not there but yeah the first three
years as I said the campus I would never
forget the the name I got in the campus
as a very mischievous person who at the
age of two always had a call to my
mother and father saying that your son
is sitting on the parapet wall of the of
the flats or roaming around somewhere
uh I do remember the playgrounds that we
used to have within the campus so it was
a nice three years of experience and
I've always been called as a very
mischievous person in the whole campus
and that they would be able to say okay
he is so and so uh son because he would
always be roaming around at the age of
two years itself going to each of the
people's house and my mother used to
find it very difficult to contain me
inside the house so that's how I was I
think that quality still as the
inquisitiveness is something what I have
developed right through my and that
memory is also one of the key aspect of
myself keeping all the good things in
your memory right from your childhood
also helps so the two qualities in those
first three years is to observe and
accuate what into your memory and also
the keenness to explore though it was a
problem to my parents I think that was
something that still holds me good in
terms of trying to find out new things
learning as such and I think this would
be a good connect to this podcast nice
Chan it's really great to that you
remember all those that time and that
actually shaped you as a person so
that's really great to know so you said
that your father was working in HR
department yes now HR is a very I say a
very promising field in fact I look at
today time I think what defines the
success of an organization is all about
people if you can great of smart people
give them all the authority and give
them a a playground for them to perform
their best that defines your success so
you never thought of working in in HR
getting into your father footsteps see
that's one good thing about uh what
happened to me I was able to choose my
carrier and my father never pushed me
into saying that this is what you need
to do but if you ask me through whether
I wanted to get into HR I saw the
hardship that my father used to go
through he was in charge of the fact
workers and the various GS he had gone
through he was part of ECS he was in HL
and then he retired as a senior vice
president of HR from quanis I'm not sure
whether you know about that
so so that was his carrier Journey but
he never forced me saying that this is
what it is and I had an opportunity to
either be a doctor or engineer that's
always been the case in ' 90s right in
'90s uh as an Indian and you have just
two Avenues either if you are in a
middle class family you either say that
you have a aspiration to be a doctor or
an aspiration to be an engineering with
with computer science as your thing and
then fortunately I got a engineering
college and there began my life uh but
one thing I was very clear uh trishna I
didn't want to stereo myself because at
that point of time there were two things
because 9695 is when the it started and
in fact I would say that uh where people
were saying programming is the key
aspect of somehow uh I didn't want we
get pushed into that programming mindset
I said that no programming is not what I
want to get into many people were
questioning my decision saying that look
that's how things are you could go to us
you could be rich and all of those I
said no that is not my passion that's
not what I want to do so I didn't go in
to an IT line and another fun anecdote
is basically the reason why I'm saying
is I said my father was a HR person and
he was a senior vice president in Kanis
at that point of time in fact Kanis did
come to an University for their campus
interview but I did not attend and I
told my friends that if I get my job I
would have to get my job on my own
merits and my capability and not on my
father's whims and fancies because he's
a HR head in a in a reputed company so I
choose my career once I did my
engineering the funny part was that we
were about seven people staying in a
house we rented a house in an five of
them had got campus and it was me and
another person who did not have any
placement as part of our final year
engineering I did go through a lot of
turmoils at that point of time yeah year
2003 no no I passed out in 2001 so that
is 2 2001 is when I did my final year uh
engineering so that was also the do
burst uh yeah
basically
2004 2004 it started becoming better but
2001 till 1 2 3 was really bad really
bad similar to what is happening in the
current year for the yeah exactly
exactly so I would say see that's where
it is like um God is always there and
God chalks your life is what people say
right uh in a way me not getting a
placement was a blessing in disguise
because uh 2001 uh a lot of people got
that placement uh and but unfortunately
because of the Doom burst most of the
companies were not able to honor the the
placement uh that they were so my
friends uh lost their six months because
they were waiting for the companies to
call up then I took a decision my father
called me spoke to me and said look a I
see that you don't want to get into
coding as your profession so what is
that you want in your life I said I want
to be something some person who will be
contributing towards what do I say
developing the software that is I want
to be the knowledge person uh anme in
the area Bas through which these
developers would be able to do the
coding so he said if that is the case
why can't you do finance and systems
because he was in HR he knew what is
happening in the industry he said I
think this is the fin fintech financials
is going to be the next best thing in uh
in coming years so why don't you do an
MBA so I wrote an entrance and I got
through in
SSN um so uh I did finance and systems
and my first job was uh in a very very
small company it was a UK based company
but still a very small company it is
still there in existence right now
called bordex I joined there as a
financial analyst and also was helping
in developing their uh systems the two
years I spent there I was a financial
analyst going through the board papers
understanding the financial uh of
various listed companies around the
world and then putting it into their
software they had their proprietary
software so I was also helping them in
developing the proprietary software and
I was also doing that so I started off
in a very very small way and my salary
was uh next to nothing I would say uh at
that point of time and and again the
funny part was everybody was saying you
joined for such a low salary your father
again see your life goes through this
pressure right your people starts to
always question you your father is a HR
why can't you push him and get him a
good job which can pay you really well
as I said I had that just for my my CL
Clarity so saying that after you
completed engineering since you had not
got placement from your College
placement so you didn't take a gap year
you straight away went for MBA based on
your father's advice this bordex job you
got through campus from SSN college no
not through campus again it was through
outside placement applied for it and I
got that it was not through campus and
there is no how you apply what see these
days there is internet there there's so
much of like awareness about through
through uh newspapers through newspaper
and through friends who were applying
their uh so naturally you have people
who would be guiding you right say there
is an opening there there is opening
there so that's how I applied for it and
I got this uh job so uh it was not
through campus and I don't have any
shame in saying that during MBA I went
through a lot of personal turmoil
through because every semester I had
jundas uh and in one semester I had uh
chicken box so I didn't do well in my
MBA so if you really ask me at the end
of the day I passed out in second class
so I was the only person in my class who
was in second class and everybody Were
In First Class above 60% and of course I
missed out uh my first class by 5% 59.5
and 60 and above becomes a first class
but anyway I don't regret it right now
because the reason why I'm I'm opening
about this is that sometimes the young
people think that marks makes your life
uh it's not the case and I could be a a
great example because I never good I
scored good in my 10 so coming back so
since I was uh I had a lot of Aras
naturally campus was not a possibility
uh so that was the reason why I had to
actually uh look out and unfortunately I
got that and U and and here again the
reason why I keep saying this is uh have
some pride uh people have to have pride
in themsel and uh should have that
ability to say that no no matter what
you would be able to succeed in life on
your own terms so I said no I want to
succeed in my life in my own terms so I
said okay I I will apply myself I will
get whatever the job no matter what the
amount that job job place I will get in
all I need is experience and then
experience will help me grow worked in
that I worked for two years it was
extreme fun because it was a completely
young uh uh people all out of college um
and and those two years actually also
helped me because I'm passionate
cricketer I'm an passionate in cricket
and I played Cricket for my school
played Cricket in my college and that
continued in in that company because we
had a team of our own we create or
formed a team of our own so that how
helped so two years I worked there and
the experience I gained in terms of the
the fintech knowledge and also
contributing some amount in terms of
development led me to my next company
sundram infotech solution uh which was
into uh mortgage uh software development
so they were developing software for
various uh Financial companies like
mahra Finance their own in know sundram
finance and various other Financial
companies they were creating uh mortgage
platform so I went in there as a
business analyst in in
2015 15 2005 sorry 2005 2005 if you look
at if I reflect chuth 2005 this business
analyst was not a very well known and
popular role no it wasn't how was
offered to you how did you in fact today
it has become a very I'll say I'll say
most in demand one of the most in demand
role most of the business analysts they
end up becoming product manager which is
obviously a very powerful role these
days but how did you come across this
role called business analyst and decided
to take on when that role is not I'm
sure none of your classmates or anybody
known would have been playing that role
that that was the time it was coming up
and uh that's said as I said right
coming back to what I said earlier my my
goal was to be a person who becomes anme
who would be contributing towards the
development right so I when I read
through the job profile job description
of that
uh that is the first time we also knew
something about business analyst right
so the job profile when it went through
that I saw that this is what the
contribution is that you need to sit
with the client understand their
requirements and then translate that
into uh uh PRD document that you call
right business requirement document and
then writing functional specification
document and other stuff I said yeah
this is what I I always wanted and um so
that's when I read through it I said
this is what I need to do it also and my
ability on on the financial side of it I
help me to get through the interview and
um and and you're see you if you want to
be a business an analyst it's more of
about your communication skills right
because you have to be able to connect
with your client understand their
requirements commit accordingly and then
make a requirement according to their uh
what they want in I think so I got this
job uh that was the next best thing uh
because I still continueed to play
cricket because sundram had a very good
uh cricket team they they play in
divisions of course I couldn't get into
that team which played in division but
of course I we still played a lot of
cricket in those uh those those years uh
so I I learned a lot of software uh and
that's when I got exposed to for the
first time auditing side of it uh
because uh
isms how did business analyst and
auditing came into Play Because isms
audits were at that point of time was
getting in Right iso 270001 was
kickstarting at that point of time in
2005 and where every company wanted to
get into this ISO 27 certification and
there were lot of uh certification being
a client company you have to have
certain certification right so I was
exposed into that aspect where uh I I
was represent ing sundaram in the uh
audits uh when external Auditors came in
I was representing so I that was the
first taste of my audit experience being
on the other side learning and that
fascinated me uh the auditing fascinated
me uh I said yeah I think that's that's
a good line um so how what what what is
that I need to do to to that so that's
when I did my cesa so I I said okay if I
need to get into it I need to upscale
myself how do I upscale myself MBA is
not enough and I need to do something
which is relevant I can get into uh the
technology line of it because when you
are a business analyst you have exposure
to database uh basically because uh
being a business anal at that point of
time you need to do everything so your
SQL querying ability was there for me at
that point of time so I know how to
query into a database I know how to look
into these uh servers to an extent so I
said okay I have the basic knowledge how
do I improve upon it I did my cisa I
cleared my cisa in my first attempt uh
which was again uh the the best part was
it was a a gift to myself for my wedding
uh so I cleared it just a month before
my wedding uh or marriage in 2007 year
was it 2007 I cleared my prepare for it
like in 2007 and all I remember the
online platforms that help you nothing
was that nothing was that so it was
basically a big book uh and the old
style of the highlighter yellow
highlighter and I prepared for about
eight months and I did go for a crash
course uh in isaka chenai chapter so
Chennai chapter isaka had this crash
course for a month so that was my first
attempt and uh fortunately I was able to
clear my examination or cesa exams are
not uh uh easy to clear because all four
answers are correct it's the best of the
four that you need to clear so you have
to be very thorough in in your answer
you can't guess it and then write it so
I cleared my exam in 2007 and uh at that
point of time is when I went into my
first uh auditing side of it in Verizon
I joined Verizon in
2006 while I was studying my cisa uh I
told them that look I have the aptitude
to be an auditor I know uh the database
because that was vdsi was also a
development company uh in Chennai so I
told them look I know how to look into
it so I can do be an auditor and they
they they accepted it and they said okay
I think you're right fit so I was the
first person in the team I still
remember so at that point of time
Verizon was also developing into a big
company it's now a huge company but at
that point of time it was still a n
stage I think Verizon was established in
Chennai in 20056 so it
2006 and end of 2006 is when I joined so
our was the first audit team within
Chennai that was created and uh I got in
within six months of that I cleared my
cesa examination and that's where my
auditing and risk
uh life started and I've been doing
auditing and risk related activity for
the past uh 50 Years starting to
2007 great and and that's really a
fascinating Journey auk so after veran
you join directly standard charted or
there was other company no I I was with
bny melan for seven and a half years um
the previous version of bny melon Tech
was called iotics and now it is called
bny melon technology so I was with
iotics for four years in Risk role and I
was doing isms audits within iotics so I
was doing risk at as well as is isms
audits for four years and then for a
short brief period I went to Cognizant
for about 8 months thinking that
Consulting might be uh a right uh line
but unfortunately I did a course I
didn't uh it didn't set for me the the
Consulting was not something which I
realized is not the bread and butter for
me so I came back to b& but this time as
an auditor uh within the internal audit
team in
2013 uh not 2013 2012 I came back and so
in bny this time not in iotics I joined
bny prent company in Chennai itself uh
where as an audit auditor and uh doing
audit for uh the entire Globe the
technology audit where it was database
application server uh I was doing
everything uh including audits on uh the
companies like persing iotics which were
all their subsidiaries so that is how I
start I was doing in b&y and in 2015 uh
September I joined standard ched and
I've been here in standard chter happily
for eight years uh completed 8 years as
of uh September of 2022 and being part
of Technology audit and now I'm
currently part of uh the cyber security
Enterprise technology audit team that's
great and great to know that you are so
happy in a standard charted and working
there for last eight year I'm sure I see
people General Trend that people who
work for banks they really work for a
very very long duration so I think I'm
sure they're doing something really good
so tell me CH that your role is auditor
I think all of us have seen Auditors
coming and asking questions and saying
that show me that why this is in this
way why it is not done in this
particular Manner and so on so every
function gets audited by someone or
other in most organizations once they
reach a certain size so from your
perspective what do you look for for in
an in an audit like what is your
objective objective is to go and audit
and find some false or objective is
something else how never never I I
always tell my people who are joining in
new to audit tell them that audit is not
about finding false uh it's about uh
finding facts so it's not a fault
finding activity it's a fact finding
activity when it the reason is there's a
difference if you say it as fault you
would always have your your stakeholder
is pushing back because they always want
to uh make sure that they don't get
blamed for for what is the the issue
that you're finding right but rather if
you are if it is a fact finding it
becomes collaborative you tell them that
look this is a cap but of course no
organization or a department can be
foolproof in any way and that's where
the audit comes in audit is as a third
line of defense is not there to point
pick issues and uh uh make the
organization look bad rather it is to
point pick issues to make the
organization better and stronger I think
that's the mentality as an auditor you
need to create and uh the the the most
important skill for an auditor is not
about how strong you are with technology
but more of how strong you are as a
human because you need to be a human
auditor you have to connect with your
audities and the stakeholders before you
actually can do your audit so my first
thing and in any audit that I do is uh
to make a personal bonding you can't
make a 100% personal Bing but make sure
that you have the Auditors uh
comfortable with you and the when you
make them comfortable they they open up
with you because they get the trust and
the best best and the most important
aspect of being an auditor is creating
Trust
uh and people say that trust is only
with your customers no trust has to be
there built across your within the
organization and that would actually go
beyond the organization in terms of
creating trust with your uh C customers
so the trust is the key when you are an
auditor and I I ensure that I create
trust with them and before I start an
audit then your technological mindset in
terms of asking the right question is
where you have to keep upskilling and
learning doing a new courses that comes
into picture but as a auditor the the
fine skill or the ma the major skill
that you need to have is being a human
auditor so generally what I've seen ACH
in my experience is that if auditor
comes everybody is very defensive and
that's the last thing that they want to
fix so you saying that because of your
this your human to human connection when
whenever you're auditing end up building
trust and and you become more welcoming
and collaborative rather than try to
someone who's like kind of policing you
and showing you
that exactly see the the the being human
is and being a human is basically you
listen right that that goes well with
not just your profession with with your
personal life also so when you start to
listen to people uh the first thing that
you they would do is they would they
would be able to share more about what
what is happening within their
Department right but when you keep
interrupting them and keeps trying to
say that no no no I think that is wrong
no no no that is wrong that is wrong
that is wrong they become defensive and
then you end up getting it difficult to
get what you want and at the end of the
day you don't actually benefit uh out of
the audit because the audit becomes more
of uh tutu M kind of a thing that people
start to point fingers at each other and
say that no this is not what it should
be and this is not how it should be and
then it goes into a different direction
and the audit will never end you can't
end you can't find a issue you can't uh
put an action plan and you can't get
into a proper solutioning aspect of it
so listen is listening is the key aspect
of it here uh
Krishna So based on what you told me
achit so far I again want to go back to
your sundram days where you started your
second role in sundram as a business
analyst now from business analyst you
ended up becoming a a in cyber security
auditor now at that point time you also
had a had a potential career path of
becoming a product manager so at what
point time you decided that maybe taking
this uh route is much more aligned with
your with who you are as a person and
that might give you more satisfaction
compared to pursuing the path of a
product manager yeah exactly that's a
good question Krishna the reason I
choose that is that uh as I said I have
all always being a person who listens
and that was the key aspect even if
being a business analyst because you
need to listen to your customers when
they say the requirements and you need
to be patient to uh say that this is the
requirement of the client to the
developers when they when they do their
development uh as I said when I was part
of the isms audits in Sund I saw how the
Auditors were interacting with us and
how the datas were collected and I I was
I felt fascinated saying that I think I
have the skill set in terms of
connecting with people and at that point
of time I keep reading about what is
happening in the industry also I was
also reading that the next thing that is
going to be big is being an auditor and
that to being an technology auditor with
the amount of digitization that was
happening 20078 is where people were
moving towards a complete digitization
in the fintech world right so I was
thinking that in the fintech as well as
in in any industry uh so uh and and
protecting the data was becoming the
most important aspect of it until then
data protection was not a key aspect but
in 20078 so six is when people were
starting to talk about the data
protection I said okay I read that and I
said okay if I have to go into that line
being uh that what is that I need to do
I I then found out that auditor auditing
is the right way to go in uh and I can
when I move into the risk side risk
world or the auditing world I would be
able to do that aspect of it and I could
still keep my the inan state of being
human in terms of interaction will also
still continue to be there plus uh your
knowledge of finance will always help
because when you do audit later point of
time even right now without my financial
knowledge if I go to a business a
business team and ask them about uh the
controls business controls technology
controls I need to understand so I had
that skill I had my technology skills I
had the the ability I did my cesa so I
said I become a holistic person in that
aspect and I I I I jumped in from that
product management yes uh being a
business analyst I could have gone to uh
be becoming uh basically at that point
of time those who are in business
analyst all went to us uh became client
side facing in us but for me somehow us
was not a Fascination at all for me it
was about my satisfaction whether I
liked it whether I I enjoyed it or not
so I said what would make me happy I
felt Audi is what would make me happy
and I I choose this carrier so uh a my
next question is about this us moov see
I've seen in particular in India
especially people from Tamil Nadu and
Andra are highest number of software
professionals working in us and first
generation immigrant so dream is to go
and work in us and maybe also settled
there in US you also see parents having
that pressure also that okay their kids
have their like their colleagues and
neighbors kids have gone and settled
there so you never had that kind of
pressure coming from your parents or
in-laws no never never at all as he said
right I've always been an individual
person strong enough to say this is what
my my career is and this is what I want
to do in my life uh and and in a way I
would say that it is a blessing in
disguise because people don't yeah of
course people are are doing good in us
uh monetarily and also they are having
fun in lot of ways but the the the
aspect that many Miss is their parents
because most of them are in India and
I've seen people when something is
happening to their parents they find it
very difficult to support them staying
in us so I think uh in a way my decision
to stay here was also in that aspect
that my parents supported me right
through my younger days and help me to
be who I am and right now I am able to
support them being with them and and the
Assurance they have that okay they have
their son right next to him or her uh
that is something that I don't think
anybody can replace that happiness as
such of course I do miss out on money I
do miss out on the various other
lifestyle uh changes that could have
happened to me but somehow I feel that
uh
life I choose to be in Chennai be in
India uh was the right decision in lot
of ways and I'm contented with that
aspect and I have not felt uh very what
do I say did I do a wrong uh thing of by
not choosing to go out of India I would
say no I have never felt that way and of
course your pressure is there because
all my cousins are us uh that's always
there all my cousins are in Us in fact
as you rightly said my cousins were
first time immigrants in 95 96 when the
the actual boom was happening so they
were they all went into development they
went to us in 95 996 through various
companies in India to to us and now they
are all US citizen and uh green card
holders and other stuff even my friends
are there but I'm contendent in that
aspect of it and there's a lot of
benefit being in India uh I think only
when people go through it will know what
that benefits
are yeah I completely agree in fact the
India has also changed as a country in
last 20 years exactly exactly mov from
India to US 20 years back they somehow
still carry the same India impression of
20 years
back more I'll say powerful and
satisfying and monetarily also rewarding
career option right here in India we
don't have to go there because I also
find sometime very surprising that a lot
of people who work for IT services
company here in in us they get paid so
low that I it makes me wonder that how
do they survive in such such low
salaries here in us they're better of
maybe getting one fifth of that salary
in rupees terms and leading a better
life in India compared to just surviving
it's always good to know that you're not
I think most of the life I'll say sorrow
comes when you start comparing yourself
with others but if you only start
comparing with I think you just do
Improvement compared to where you are so
that's really great point
question that I have on to you is that
you are an engineer you did MBA you're
also a CIS and I know that certified
information security auditor that isaka
conducts it was a tough exam earlier
also it's a tough exam now also it's not
not people don't end up completing that
certification so easily even today also
things have moved from 2007 to 2023 24
now now in terms of like so much of
online resources available YouTube
videos like uh interviews from previous
past candidates all kinds of question
Banks simulation test like uh online
curriculum instructor Le classes at the
convenience of your desktop and mobile
phone everything is available still the
exam is tough so we when you already
have this three credential engineering
MBA and cisa certificate at what point
of time you realize that I should do one
more formal course and add to uh my
educational qualification that will help
me become better at what I'm doing yeah
so the the rational and reason why I did
my uh course here in simply learn on
cyber security from TripIt Bangalore is
basically because uh first four years of
my career in standard charted was in
technology application audit I was as
part of the application uh technology
audit team internally I moved into cyber
security audit team and um though I knew
about what is cyber security what is
servers what is the infrastructure all
about and other stuff if you don't have
a validation within yourself to say that
what is being told to you is what needs
to be from the industry side it would
become difficult as an auditor uh
because when you find an issue you
should be strong from yourself to say
that this is an issue for that you need
to be confident on the issue that you
found so that's the reason why I said
okay what is that I could do to gain
that confidence I I know what is cyber
security I know what is infrastructure I
know what it is uh I had an option
either to do a cyst or do a certif to do
a a course
like what was the option you had what is
the
cissp uh IC IC iCare right I Square
certified security uh I think some
security professional professional yeah
so I had an option to do AIS or to do
this kind of thing so I was actually
doing a lot of research and when I did
the research that's when I came through
this simply learn course somehow I
decided that cisp is not the immediate
requirement I could always do it later
in fact that's one of my aspiration for
this year is to complete my CIS
hopefully I could but I said okay the
certification I can do but I need to
First gather the basic knowledge and be
uh to strengthen that knowledge piece
what do I need to do to strengthen the
knowledge base of what I know already
but with a validation to that what I
know is where I said okay I need to do a
an executive kind of program uh and and
I was going through a lot of courses
through simply learn and various other
portals like simply learn and I saw a
lot of other portals also offering
similar kind of courses from with MIT as
the thing what really attracted me with
simply learn was uh the integration with
theit Bangalore the premium Indian
Institute uh yeah I could again go for
an us Institute which says that MIT uh
but I felt that okay MIT and TripIt I
feel triple it Bangalore is again
probably I'm a DIY person in that aspect
I always had that DIY feeling I said
okay trip it ban Bangalore and the the
best part of why I choose Tri Bangalore
is my brother younger brother he did his
mtech from TripIt Bangalore so uh so I
know about that college also and about
the reputation of that College in fact
it is one of the most Premier Technology
Institute which has a lot of patents
also and and the director right now not
right now the the previous director was
one of the well-known person in who was
actually a kind of what do I say he was
adviser to the government of India
too sopan sir Dr sadagopan s was an
adviser to government of India also so
that is the kind of reputation so
something that was contributing towards
the India growth and India stack right
so I said okay I think triple Bangalore
is the the right course and then the
added uh advantage of npci national
payment Corporation of India's uh
internship program and and and if people
don't know what it is it is the company
which developed the UPI platform for the
entire India and now you know that India
is surviving because of I could Clearly
say it's surviving because of this
wonderful platform that was developed by
npci so I said okay something da see
again in that as happens so I know that
simply learn cyber security program with
triple Bangalore has a virtual
internship with npci but what happen the
virtual internship so the virtual
internship was that I I remember that
there were about three or four classes
from the people from npci uh I think
from the risk and audit side who had a
good session on how they managed the
financial protection of the data how
they did that what is required because
they're going to handle a huge thing
right in terms of if a transactions are
going through that platform if they are
not secure that's where people will
start to uh get in right so how they
strengthen their Bas in terms of
security and other stuff that was the
most interesting aspect of it and and
the internship also made us do a small
practical case study was given to us
where how do you secure a data kind of a
practical thing which we need to
demonstrate and we had to submit and
that was evaluated and that based on
which the internship was uh that the
certificate was provided so we do get a
certificate from npci also and the other
aspect of npci is that my line is also
banking right so digital is what it is
so I thought that this would make sense
because I could actually uh get gain get
the experience of what I hear from these
npci folks and see how relevantly it
could be placed within my bank too so
that was also one of the other reasons
and rational why I said okay this is
also a good reason why I should be doing
it and of course of all things um
comparatively simply learn gave a good
good uh Buy in also in terms of the
monetary aspect of it it was uh onethird
of the cost of the various other
platforms which was providing the same
cost with MIT being a bad as as as a
thing I felt that uh it was cost to your
outcome of what you want to achieve I
felt that this was also much more useful
for me that's great to know so now I
want to just talk about one point that I
see a lot of people with a with a high
higher number of experience struggling
see what happens is that we see a lot of
Learners who are still in their early
career like someone who who became let's
say a software engineer and they want to
get into a data science they want to do
a formal course from an i or a or a
global Institute Global Education
Institute like MIT or or take any other
Institute and they look at that as an
education that okay I did this
a formal education now I want to switch
my career and most such examples like
people who are in quality analyst they
want to become a developer developer
wants to become a data scientist or a
machine learning engineer or a developer
wants to become a product manager or a
developer wants to become architect all
that is very common that you have couple
of years of experience you want to
switch your role but you're still like
I'll say below five six years of
experience so anywhere from one year to
six seven year years of experience we
see this taking a course to switch their
domain very very common now what what we
see that as people get more experience
like let's say become 10 year 15 years
of experience that time if they have a
change in their roles like in your case
it's not exactly a big bang change in
role but but it's technically a change
in role because you are formally going
to do audit of cyber security but you
wanted to get gather more in-depth
knowledge of cyber security so that you
can talk to your business guys on same W
length that I understand what it means
and I have also done this program so I
know all the intricacies and I can talk
to you in your own language right so
this is what what I understand is the
objective for doing the program but what
we see that um the typical approach that
most people take that I already have 15
16 years of experience why should I go
and take a course I can do Google Search
I can do YouTube I can learn from here I
can learn from there and then I I with
that I can get enough information to do
my job like one of the thing that we so
it's not about only simply learn as a
platform I'm talking about industry in
general see what we at simply Lear what
what I always like um talk about it
publicly is that it's not important that
you come and do a program with simply of
course I like it if you do it but that's
not what what I personally stand for I
personally stand for the need to do
constant upscaling you just do it from
any anywhere else as long as you're
learning if not from anywhere just go to
YouTube and learn something you're going
You're are going to add value to us in
fact we contribute so much of courses to
YouTube we have this skill up platform
where we offer a lot of courses for free
and so on so we are we our primary
objective is to help people realize that
upskilling has a value but this this 15
plus years of experience people always
debate that shouldn't I just go to
YouTube and all these resources and
learn something rather than doing a
course and one thought that we tell them
that when such learner comes to us is
that see look at your opportunity cost
you are already getting paid x amount of
salary if you calculate that salary to
your hourly rate and you spend time
going through
lot of resources on internet so internet
has both plus and minus the plus is that
everything is available the minus is
that it's very distracting you're
reading a video suddenly there will link
you go to another video then you find
something else you get to another video
so you started From a Certain topic by
the time you loopin loopin looping you
are on a totally different topic because
very easy to get distracted because so
much of links getting built in so if you
want to do a formal you want to
understand a topic the best way is to
pick up a book complete the book so that
you know that you are started a book and
you finished a book or take a course
which is well structured and you
complete the program so but we still see
a lot of people deciding to do this what
we what we call relying on internet
resources to get knowledge and and
enough knowledge so that they can talk
about this topic but they don't take the
approach that you took that okay I want
to do a formal course from a reputed
Institute do handson and get up to the
speed so did you speak to your
colleagues about doing that call or how
do you how did you make make that
decision and I'm sure you know a lot of
colleagues who wanted to learn and they
followed the other approach of not
taking a course but relying on Internet
Resources no I think uh that's uh where
my bank comes into picture I have to
tell them tell this here is that
stratter helps people to do upscaling
they encourage that they they say that
you can't just be sitting where you are
you need to learn a lot so we have a an
internal learning portal and they
encourage you to do courses so if so as
part of our performance apprisal or the
the the the goal setting that you have
right is like there's one uh area of
skill development or development as part
of our growth plan what we call it as so
Standard chter Bank actually uh makes
people say that your growth is not about
just growing as a person within the
organization but growing as a person uh
with knowledge so upskilling is
something which uh Bank increases and uh
they we have a good uh budget uh for
each team allocated for doing these kind
of courses so uh if you if you do these
courses you would be reimbursed so
people don't have to spend uh money of
course not the full amount but still at
least you are able to get substantiate
amount of your course fee from the bank
and they encourage you to do that that's
that's something which is amazing right
so s encourages you to take up these
kind of courses and and make people say
that you specialize you do your
upskilling by specializing on things so
they offer trainings within the our own
portal and in doing so they support
these kind of courses by saying you go
out do these courses and and upscale
yourself and in in a way being a bank
right uh you are always subject to
regulatory scrutiny and when a regulator
comes in and says who are part of your
team as an as an audit auditor And when
they see that okay this person has these
kind of uh certifications The Regulators
also feel uh comfortable saying that
okay the bank is managed by those who
have the right skills to look into what
they are looking into it's not a haard
side of it so but people forget that you
could become a knowledge Creator or a
knowledge eming person but that doesn't
actually help you in uh professional way
basically because you have to remember
that certifications always help you to
stand out different because at that
point of time you can't go to the
regulator and say I am a YouTube uh Aid
fan I know everything about uh cyber
security I know everything I have I can
tell you all of this but the regulator
doesn't regulator believes in having
because even in India right our own
regulator say cesa is a must if you if
you are an auditor right that's that's
something which they bringing in right
now as part of the law itself so so that
being the case certifications and these
kind of courses are becoming a backbone
of how uh a company is perceived to have
the right skilled persons within the
team to do the right thing so um so if
yeah of course I am also a YouTuber I
can go in I do also learn about a lot of
things but I accept because when I moved
to cyber security that's how I moved
into cyber security I knew a lot of
things basically through these Google
search reading and the basic knowledge
of what it is through YouTube and other
stuff I wanted to substantiate myself to
say that I will give a formal uh name to
it by doing a course and that's how I
choose this course and people should
understand that aspect of it saying that
you could be a uh thing but at the end
of the day uh world is being judged with
what you have as a certification to
substantiate your knowledge base and I
think these kind of coures will help you
to substantiate that it's it's my
personal feeling uh Krishna well it's
great to know and and thanks for sh
sharing a detail note on that AUD so now
AUD what next for you now that you have
done this course you're already a senior
audit manager how how do you see your
career maybe I'll not talk about five
years that's a long period of time but
next two years what do you what what is
that you looking forward to achieve so
the next two years so as I said learning
never stops and uh uh I I would be doing
my
cissp uh certification so that's
something which would do uh so from the
learning perspective uh keep to keep
oppressed with what is happening in the
industry uh because uh it's almost two
years since I completed my uh a uh in
cyber security from Simply learn so I
I'm already old in that aspect and
industry has uh actually moved at at a
at a at a lightning speed from what it
was two years back so keep abess with it
learn keep learning uh from the carrier
perspective um I I I can know that what
my career path in Str charted is uh
somehow the work life balance that uh I
have with uh within this team and this
bank has always helped me to be uh to do
this kind of
upskilling uh and and um I know what my
path is to slowly become a head of audit
and then
probably get into first line and second
line uh that's something which I could
uh do at later point of time uh but my
my my knowledge that I have right now
has is has put me in a good uh State uh
for um further carer enhancement and
I've always been able to take a good
decision to know what I need to do in
the next space and I think I'm still not
reach the place where I am desperate to
go to the next level for me still I'm in
a place where I have to learn a lot
before I can go go to the next level of
uh being a head of audit because a head
of audit it brings in a different kind
of uh uh skill sets right so um that
upskilling still requires and needs so
yeah of course lead a team uh within uh
the organization and of course become uh
uh technology uh uh driving Factor
within my bank and in in the first line
or the second line aspect also if if it
permits or stay put in or it also so
something which I I have the flexibility
as
such what is the second line and first
line I don't understand that what do you
mean okay so we have three lines of
difference right so the first line is
where they are people who uh put all
these Securities into things like the
basically the Cyber defense center uh
the the the the access control Team all
of those are basically the techn you
call it a CIO team or the CTO team or
various companies have their own
designated Co team or whatever that they
call it right the technology uh team
which uh puts in all the controls whom
who who are our stakeholders as an
auditor right we go and do audit on the
first line and the second line two two
things second line is basically the risk
or the team which uh
creates these standards these uh
policies uh and then they are the ones
who uh does the risk assessments uh so
that's the second line the first line is
the the actual implementers second
liners are basically those who are uh
the the one who would set the standards
the policies what you need to follow and
third line we don't go and check on
these two people to say whether they are
sufficient in nature that accuse the
company ass said so so I still have the
ability to switch to any of these uh two
lines down down my carrier also good I I
didn't know that this is how people
cyber team plans them so something that
I learned actually something new so
thank you for that so A see one point
that I wanted to like really touch upon
is that once people have a family
they're married the kids especially
school goinging kids there's a lot of
Demand on the personal side also and of
course work continues to be uh demanding
uh especially if you are in a senior
role that you are in so and in that
scenario you have work you have personal
commitments and you have expectation
from the family and at that point of
time if you want to do a course it's not
an easy uh thing to manage right because
in fact sometime I also see people
saying that once I do a course my kids
are saying that Papa why are you also
studying do you also have an exam not so
how tell us how this journey was uh for
your family yeah so this when I choose
this uh course and I told my wife that
look for the next six months uh the
weekends are off the chart uh especially
because uh I was the first co-head for
uh this uh program so I was the first
pass out I would say I could proudly say
about that uh that was one of the first
people to finish this a uh so I told
them at that point of time it the course
was only during the weekends Saturday
and Sunday uh and the classes were
between 7 and 11 in the evening so your
evening programs are off the chart and
so I have uh two kids uh my son at that
point of time was in his ninth standard
eighth or he was completing his eighth
and then going into ninth and my
daughter was in fourth standard to fifth
standard so so I had to call them and
said look uh apaa is going to actually
do a course so Saturday and Sunday is
going to be difficult we won't be able
to go out as as much as what we used to
go uh to any malls or any place or to
even to relative place because my eight
hours of the weekend is completely
booked um my wife was very very
supportive he said no AIT I think this
is something which you need to do to
make sure that you uh get your cont
conference and make yourself happy in
what you are doing so she said no you
can do it I will take care and manage
the kids expectation uh from my side so
that's something which uh was a big
blessing because uh I could I could I
could now say that there were a lot of
weekends where the frustrations were
running High saying that look this
weekend I could I thought we could go
out but my my wife managed it very well
and she made sure that the expectation
of the kids were taking care of and in
in a in a way my kids were also really
really uh supportive um the question
that you just asked Papa why are you
studying what is making you study right
now why should you go through this that
that is a uh question that my daughter
kept asking saying that why are you why
should we and I think that was something
of a good learning curve for them also
because I I told them that look in life
uh your learning doesn't stop after you
finish your College learning continues
right through your thing and I think
your apaa is the right person for you to
take up and say that at any point of
time in your life at whatever be the age
you can still go through uh learning and
I think that was also a big learning for
them and which I am sure that would help
them in their uh future career too so I
would like to thank my wife and my kids
here uh my son and my daughter uh whove
been supportive right through and and
one thing when I'm talking about the
family I would also also thank simply
learn about because being in the first
CAD covid was still active at that point
of time when I was doing my thing and we
were hit with a huge covid wave uh in
between I started in November coher uh
November of
2020 uh yeah it is 2024 right so 2021
November and January 2022 there was a
big uh wave of covid and we had a lot of
disruptions in January and February
because of which uh we had the six
months course extended simply learn was
very very understanding in that aspect
uh I had covid at that point of time in
January my wife had covid at that point
of time in January uh so um um simply
learned accepted the fact that yes uh
you are going through through some
personal thing so we will not push you
to finish it by me because as per the
coher I should have finished my course
by me so I was able to get about a month
extra month or month and a half
extension wherein I was able to finish
all of my uh theoretical exams as well
as the Practical exams and submitted uh
which was something amazing which I
never expected to have a platform be
flexible to say that uh yeah we will
accommodate you and and the the
relationship they had with TripIt
Bangalore uh to say that look this is
the reason why the delay is happening
and making them understand the rational
why uh things are getting delayed I
think that's something because they kept
telling to me that don't worry about all
of this uh we will take care of uh those
uh as long as you're able to feel
comfortable don't stress yourself don't
strain yourself uh do your course
properly and get your uh theoretical and
practical exams well and submit it we
will then take care of it as amazing and
and and the thorough job that TripIt
Bangalore did because one other uh key
part why I took uh this uh course and
something which I forgot to say is that
this came with uh your cgpa right the
TripIt Bangalore did not just give me a
certificate they graded me in each of
those subjects and they gave me a cgpa
and and then then then then they did the
they they provided me with the
certificate that means
they did the thorough understanding
because after I finished it took about a
month for me to get the certification I
was feeling panicky and I I called up
simply learn and said why is it said
don't worry sir Tri is doing a very
thorough uh job they're asking for a lot
of data from from from us on what you
did before they could actually provide
us with something so that's something
which I don't think uh any other course
uh platform was uh providing this kind
of uh uh uh what do I say uh cgp a
certified course at the end of uh it so
that's something also think so uh for me
to complete this uh it was a full
support from my family so thanks to my
wife my kids uh thanks to Simply learn
uh at that point of time the person who
was talking to me I will tell his name
if you want to edit it out you can edit
it om chaturvedi was the person who was
actually supporting me at that point of
time uh om was there right through the
six months he was the one who was
telling me no sir don't worry this is
fine this is taken care of this is taken
care of so the support that I got I
don't think so any other platform would
have uh provided this kind of open uh
one toone personal kind of a support
that I got in fact I think I was lucky
and hope simply learn continues to
provide that kind of human touch to
those Learners who are going to come
into your platform in future to so uh
Krishna you have actually created a
great team I think that's something
which I could see with uh with what om
did to me uh that human uh touch uh
please keep up that human touch and uh I
uh thank you for uh providing me this uh
opportunity uh so that's it thank you a
and this is great to know I now see that
the certificate that you achieved has
your name it has triple ITB name it has
simply learn name I think you should
also have your wife's name that's
supported by obviously I could I could
say Mahal lakmi is her name and I think
it should she deserves it in lot of ways
so I think a it was great talking to you
and thank you for your time so if I have
to summarize what I hear you saying is
that you have not never let your past
impact to your present be like bad marks
in your your engineering or or more so
in MBA has not reduced your confidence
you always knew why why you did bad and
and you can always do good in future so
that's that's one great learning that I
would like my Learners to to uh walk
away with that don't impact your don't
let your past impact your future the
second learning that that very clearly
came out from our conversation is that
you compare yourself with yourself how
do you become how I become better
tomorrow from what I was yesterday not
really benchmarking with your peers
colleagues and friends because see
everybody is a different individual what
matters to one person might not matter
to another person so why to compare when
everybody is a separate individual so I
think that also gives you a lot of I'll
say inner satisfaction and joy because
you're not in that what we call the rat
race that okay somebody else is doing so
I should also do so that's a very clear
second point that came I think most
people are not able it's a easier set
than then I will say that it's not that
even if people want to practice but
these days the social media feed and
what we hear from our relatives and you
go to family functions all create that
kind of pressure so I think you achiev
that's a great achievement I will say
but I think it's a journey people try to
if you this something that is impacting
and you start working maybe over time
you can avoid the the impact of
environment impacting you but it's not
easy is my my my experience that it's
easier said than done so that's that's
something that you have achieved that's
really great for you and I'm sure you
you will have a lot of inner peace doing
that and third part is like don't settle
in a role because you can do the same
role for rest of your life but if you
want to grow in your career I think you
have to con constantly learn something
new especially in the current age when
things get outed like we spoke about you
did this program two year back and cyber
security in two year has advanced so
much more now with generative AI coming
I'm sure it has gone to even even bigger
levels right so how do you don't settle
and continuously look for ways to
improve yourself and that's the that's
how you like you make progress in life
so very three very clear learning
achieved and and thanks for sharing that
in fact there's a fourth point also that
I'll add is that I don't see a lot of
examples running as upskilling company
for last 10 plus years I don't see a lot
of examples of people who are more than
15 years coming and taking this program
because they somehow have this feeling
that I'm done and dusted nothing can
happen to me I got into a certain place
and maybe I'll incrementally grow if I'm
lucky but I don't think I can do
anything proactively from my side to
break the barrier and get to the next
level I think your story is a good
example that that's not true I think in
today's world whether you are young or
old is a mindset as long as you are
continuously learning you are young and
there's a lot of demand for you as a as
a individual lot of companies are
looking for great people who are not
settled and always like always aspiring
to do more more and more so thank you
for your time it was such a lovely
talking to you and look forward to
keeping in touch

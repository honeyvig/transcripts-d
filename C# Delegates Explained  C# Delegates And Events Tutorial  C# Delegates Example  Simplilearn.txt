hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel in today's session we
will be discussing about the delegates
in c sharp but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies so if you are a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with the agenda
for today's session
first and the foremost we will define
delegates in c sharp we will then learn
why and when to use delegates in c sharp
later we will discuss how to declare
delegates in c sharp
then we will learn how to initialize and
invoke delegates in c
after that we will look at the different
types of delegates in c sharp finally we
will see some major differences in how
delegates work with names and anonymous
methods
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with our
first topic that is the definition of
delegates
so what exactly are delegates
a delegate is an object that refers to a
method or it is a variable of the
reference type that can hold a reference
to the methods for example delegates in
c sharp are analogous to function points
in c or c plus plus it provides a method
for specifying which method should be
called when an event occurs
delegates are commonly used to implement
events and callback methods all
delegates are derived implicitly from
system.delegate class
here is a diagram that shows how
delegates work which is completely
similar to a pointer to the function for
example the caller invokes the delegate
an object that refers to a method or a
reference type variable that can hold a
reference to the methods for example if
you click a button on a form the program
will invoke a specific method
in a nutshell it is a type that
represents references to methods with a
particular parameter list and return
type and then calls the method in a
program for execution when needed for a
better learning experience here is a
pictorial representation of the given
example
now we will look at some essential
aspects of delegates in c sharp
firstly delegates are a good way to
encapsulate the methods
next delegates is a library class found
in the system namespace after that
delegates can also be used to invoke
anonymous methods
following that delegates are primarily
used to implement call back methods and
events
next as two or more methods can be
called on a single event delegates can
be chained together
following that it is unconcerned about
the class of the object it refers to
finally in certain context anonymous
methods of c sharp 2.0 and lambda
expressions of c-sharp 3.0 are compiled
to delegate types these features are
sometimes referred to collectively as
anonymous functions
after defining delegates we will look at
why and when to use them
programmers are frequently required to
pass a method as a parameter to other
methods delegates are created and used
for this purpose for example a delegate
is a class that contains the signature
of a method although it can be used in
any context it is frequently used as the
foundation of the c sharp event handling
model delegates can be thought of as
giving a name to a method signature here
is an example of the delegate on my
screen namely the delegate function
the delegate can be assigned to any
method that matches the delegate's
signature including the return type and
parameters now let's look at why we need
delegates in c sharp
delegates in a nutshell are object
oriented type safe and very secure
because they ensure the signature of the
method being called is correct delegates
make event management simple and easy
after determining when and why we
require delegates in c sharp we will now
try to figure out how to declare
delegates in c sharp
there are three steps in defining and
using delegates delegate keyword is used
to create a delegate first we add the
attribute the modifier the delegate
keyword the written data type the
delegate name and finally the formal
parameter as an argument the modifier
can be any following keywords or a
suitable combination of new public
private protected or internal any of the
data types we have seen can be used as
the written type it could also be a void
data type or the same name of the class
name parameter must be a valid c sharp
name because a delegate is a method
definition you must use the parenthesis
required for all methods leave the
parenthesis empty if this method will
not accept any arguments
here's an example with an access
modifier set to public and the
delegate's name is example delegate with
the int data type and
string s as a formal argument
the preceding delegate can refer to any
method that accepts a single string
parameter and returns an int variable
after we understand how to declare
delegates in c sharp now we will try to
know how to initialize and invoke
delegates in c sharp
we use the same example while declaring
the delegate to initialize and the
delegate with the keyword new as shown
on my screen we can create two objects
ex1 and ex2 that is example one and
example two next we will look at how to
invoke or call objects in delegates
we call the objects by using the
object's name followed by parenthesis
and finally a colon to end the calling
procedure let's look at a practical
demonstration of declaring and
initializing
and invoking delegates in c sharp
now we are on the practical mode and we
have started our visual studio
so you can see on my screen we have an
example this program declares a delegate
namely a calculator
this program declares a delegate namely
a calculator with a formal argument x
using system we created a delegate
example class with the access modifier
public and the static keyword the
keyword static denotes that a class has
only one instance of the member
we then declare a static variable named
value with the value 10 assigned to it
we then define a static function
addition with the same formal argument x
we calculate addition as the value equal
to the value of plus x
finally we return the result of adding
value
we then define a static function
subtraction with the same formal
argument x then we calculate subtraction
as the value equal to value minus x then
we finally return the result of
subtraction value
similarly we define a static function
multiplication with the same formal
argument x then we calculate the
multiplication as the value equal to
value multiplied by x and finally return
the result of multiplication value
lastly we declare another static
function by the name division with the
same formal argument x then we calculate
division as the value equal to value
divided by x and then we return the
result of the division value
later we define another function called
getvalue which displays the results of
all operations performed in the
calculator
finally we enter the main function where
we see how we initialize and invoke the
objects and delegates in practice for
example we created 4 objects
calculator 1 calculator 2 calculator 3
calculator 4 and used new keyword to
perform the 4 operations which are
addition subtraction multiplication and
division next we call all four objects
by assigning values to x such as here we
assign 20 to x to perform addition
because the value is initially assigned
with 10 so the sum will be 30 after that
we divide addition as 30. next to
perform subtraction we assign x to 3
because the value was previously
calculated as 30 so 30 minus 3 equals
27. similarly we assign 5 to perform
multiplication and finally we assign phi
to x which now has a value equal to 135
we divide 135 by 5 and get 27
so now i hope i made myself clear with
the code let's quickly try to run this
and see the output
there you go the program got
successfully executed and the results
are on the output terminal
now in this delegates in c sharp
tutorial we will look at some different
types of delegates in c sharp
in seisha there are three types of
delegates first type of delegate is a
single delegate followed by that we have
a multi-delegate
and finally we have a generic delegate
let's look at all these type of
different delegates in detail
so first let's try to figure out what a
single cast delegate is
this delegate can only refer to one
method at one time for example single
cast delegates refer to a single method
with a matching signature
the system generates single cast
delegates.delegate let's see a code
demonstration for a single cast delegate
for better understanding
this single cast delegate program
includes the single delegate namespace
then declares delegate1 with formal
arguments a and b of integer data type
and public access modifier then we make
a class program
in which we define an addition function
calculate the addition of a and b and
display the result of the addition
function similarly we make a subtraction
function in which we calculate the
subtraction of two variables a and b and
show the resultant difference finally
where is the main function where we
rename the object of class program to
obj using the new keyword then we
created two more objects d1 and d2 d1
for addition with two values of 100 and
200 and d2 for subtraction with the same
100 and 200.
now let's quickly run the code and see
the output
now the next type of delegate is the
multicast delegate so let us attempt to
comprehend multicast delegates
this kind of delicate can refer to
multiple methods that have the same
signature at one time let us see a code
demonstration of the multicast delegate
for a better understanding this program
uses the namespace delegate and then
declares delegate as a multi-delegate
with formal arguments a and b we define
the addition and subtraction functions
in the class program which we declare
and calculate as plus p and a minus b
respectively then the main function we
create the class program object p1 then
we declare md1 and md2 objects for
addition and subtraction operations then
we assign md1 to md1 and md2
giving the value of 100 to a and a value
of 200 to b let's try to quickly run
this program and see the output
let us now look at the third and final
type of delicate generic cache delegate
and try to understand it
generate delegate was introduced in
dotnet 3.5 and did not require the
delegate instance to be defined to
invoke the methods
there are three types of generic cache
delegate which are function delegate
action delegate and predicate delegate
now for a better understanding let us
look at the three generic delegate types
in greater detail complete with code
examples let us look at the first type
of generic delegate the function
delegate
in c shaft the function generate
delegate is found in the system
namespace this delegate accepts one or
more input parameters and returns a
single output parameter the final
parameter is regarded as the written
value in c sharp the function
generateddelegate can accept up to 16
different input parameters it must only
have one type of return the return type
is required but the input parameter is
optional
one thing to keep in mind about function
generic delegate is in c-sharp you must
use the function generic delegate
whenever your delegate returns a value
whether it takes any input parameters or
not
let's look at the second type of generic
delegate that is the action generic
delegate and try to understand it
in c sharp the action generate delegate
can also be found in system namespace it
accepts one or more parameters and
returns null this delegate can accept up
to 16 input parameters of different or
the same type
one node to remember about action
generic delegate is when your delegate
does not return any value regardless of
whether it takes any input parameters or
not you must use the action generate
delegate in c sharp the last and final
generic delegate type is the predicate
generic delegate which should be
understood
in c sharp predicate generate delegate
can also be found in system namespace
this delegate is used to validate the
methods criteria and returns the result
as a boolean either true or false it
only accepts one input parameter and
always returns a boolean value which is
required this delegate can accept a
maximum of one input and always returns
the boolean type's value
one note to remember about predicate
generic delegate is you must use
predicate generate delegate in c sharp
whenever your delegate returns a boolean
value by taking one input parameter
now let's get back to the practical mode
and take a look at the code
demonstration that will provide a clear
picture of generic delegates including
function action and predicate generic
delegates
now this is an example for generic
delegates first we have a main method
followed by the main method we have our
sum number the sum number one method
accepts three arguments and returns a
double value in this example we'll use
the function generic delegate to
accomplish the same thing we did first
similarly number two that is sum number
two method this method accepts three
parameters but returns null in this
example we'll use the action generate
delegate to accomplish the same thing
just what we did
followed by that the length methods
check accepts one string argument and
returns a boolean value in this example
we will use the predicate generate
delegate to accomplish the same
as shown in the preceding code the
function generic delegate accepts four
parameters the first three of which are
input parameters and the fourth one is
the return value then we pass the sum
number one method to the function
generate delegate function object which
will be executed when the function
delegate is invoked the preceding code
shows that the action generate delegate
accepts three input parameters first we
pass the sum number 2 method to the
action generic delegate function object
which will be executed when the action
delegate is invoked the preceding code
shows that the predicate gender delegate
accepts one string input parameter name
one we pass the check and the length
repeat
we pass the check the length method to
the predicate generic delegate function
object which will be executed when the
predicate generic delegate is invoked
this delegate can only accept one input
parameter and zero return values instead
it returns boolean value by default this
program's output shows the sum of all
the three numbers 1 2 3 of the function
sum number 1 which gives 10 plus 12.15
plus 14.78 which gives a double value of
65
similarly the sum number two function
returns the sum of all the three numbers
one two and three as 20 plus
25.45 plus 12.45 which is 57.90
and the length check function returns a
boolean value if true the length string
hello is less than 10.
the final topic will go over is
delegates using the name and anonymous
methods
a name method can be associated with a
delegate when you use a name method to
instantiate a delegate the method is
passed as a parameter for example first
we declare a delegate with the formal
argument x then we define a named method
and finally we instantiate the delegate
with the method as a parameter
this is accomplished through the use of
a named method let's go over some
delegates with named methods
delegates built with named methods can
encapsulate either a static or an
instance method in the older versions of
c-sharp name methods were the only way
to instantiate a delegate however if
creating a new method is unnecessary
overhead c-sharp allows you to
instantiate a delegate and immediately
specify a code block that the delegate
will process when called a lambda
expression or an anonymous method can be
included in the block let's go over some
delegates with anonymous methods as the
name implies an anonymous method does
not have a name for example in c-sharp
anonymous methods can be defined with a
delegate keyword and assigned to a
variable of delegate type here is an
example for a delegate with an anonymous
method on my screen anonymous methods
can access variables defined in outer
function here's an example of anonymous
method being passed to a method that
accepts the delegate as a parameter let
us now discuss lambda expressions a
lambda expression is an anonymous method
for creating delegates or expression
tree types
in 2007 microsoft introduced lambda
expressions in c-sharp 3.0 many
developers frequently confuse anonymous
methods with lambda expressions let's
compare the anonymous method and the
lambda expressions with code example
this example will provide at least two
concepts the first thing about working
of the parameters delegates and the
second about comparing anonymous methods
to a lambda expression you will notice
that you have passed parameter number
value 100 but anonymous method can omit
it and the program will still run it let
us execute this code and see the output
there you go the program got
successfully executed and the message
inside the function has been displayed
this is the function
you will notice that you have passed
parameter number value 100 but anonymous
method can omit it and the program will
still run and similarly the function
is also displaying the message inside it
that is this is the function
now let us see some limitations of using
an anonymous method
the first one is it can include jump
statements such as go to break or
continue it can access an auto methods
reference or out parameter it can
contain or access dangerous code it
cannot be used on the operator's left
side
now with that we have come to an end of

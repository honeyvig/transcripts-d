okay first first foremost important
thing is okay uh when is in the next in
November session any
dates yes inic date is November 10th
okay so November 10th is your
examination and uh
first thing is how many days are there
okay right so today is 26th so I'll be
calculating from 27th so 27
28
29 30 and 31 so you have 1 2 3 4 5 days
here followed by
um September month you have 30
days October you have
31 and November 10th is exam so you have
nine days so total how many days are
there in
I so total number of days left over for
in 75 days okay so you have 75 days to
take your inct exam so in this 75 days
uh according to my schedule okay so I
mean like uh basing upon your Comfort
I'll be giving a schedule so my plan is
preferably Let It Be an intern or a
repeater my plan is
55+ 20 okay so 55 plus 20 so means
simply I'm dividing uh all your subjects
into five modules okay so each module
I'm I'm adding 10 plus one de okay so
like few of you may be clear with few
subjects or already done with few
subjects may not be done with few
subjects but you can you have to
customize your uh p according to that
for example
now as most of your are conquers so now
the present subject that is recently
done is Os Os is already done so
whenever I'm giving a schedule for Os or
whenever I'm giving a schedule for
anatomy because in in a week you are
going to give an exam on OS plus Anatomy
Plus Dental Anatomy or maybe you may be
done with pero perfectly you may be done
with Endo perfectly I'm going to give a
schedule but try to modify your reading
patterns according to the Comfort that
you have with the subject it is
customized okay it is different for
different individuals for example if you
ask me I'm more comfortable with Endo
pedo more comfortable with oral surgery
more comfortable with general surgery
okay uh more comfortable with Community
more comfortable with proo compared to
orto or compared to biochemistry or
compared to General anotomy this is my
comfortable levels like even if I'm
reading I can read the subjects which I
have listed out I can read them fast
okay so you also plan accordingly okay
slight modifications has to be done and
please do stick onto the plan so what I
have done is it is a 55 days plus 20
days and you can modify that okay the
more the number of revision days 20 days
I have kept for revision like 21 days 3
weeks okay the more the revision days
the more you are comfortable with the
examination that is going to be the plan
so if you're already clear with few
subjects you can reduce these days and
improve the revision test that is the
first thing okay so 75 days so I what I
have splitted it my schedule is going
with 55 + 20 this 20 is revision test so
what I am giving you suggestion like
people who are done with the entire
syllabus there are list of people who
are done with the entire syllabus okay a
few except like few uh systems of your
respiratory I general medicine and
physio that is CVS and CNS and endocrine
was not done for few of you I want you
to decrease the number of revision
number of reading days and try to the
number of revision days it's already
revision for you I hope this is very
very clear for each and every one of you
please do respond
me yes okay right the next important
thing uh I want just a
second yes the next important thing is I
want you to keep more revision days the
more the revision days okay so that
increases your confidence in the
examination Hall which is very very much
required for in exams like in okay right
so in this 55 days of
reading so what I have done is I have
splitted your entire syllabus
into five modules module one module 2
module 3 module four and module five and
for every module I have given 10
days so 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 so 11th day is
your exam on that particular module and
we'll be having a
discussion right clear right okay so for
example if a particular individual is is
perfect with module two you're very
confident with the subjects of module 2
what my suggestion is you can decrease
the number of days for module 2 or if
you are perfect with module one okay you
can decrease the number of days for
module one and you can allocate those
days for a particular module where you
are weeked and in every module I make
sure there are two star subjects which
are very very much required for inic
because inic is an exam which does not
follow any sort of blueprints okay neat
they have clearly given NB has CLE
clearly given a blueprint but uh inic
does not have any blueprint so uh it is
you cannot you cannot you cannot give a
proper blueprint for inic but uh what
what my analysis like over a period of
10 years uh the analysis If You observe
the last 10 years papers most of the
question papers not all the question
papers most of the question
papers they have more inclination
towards the clinical subjects like 70%
is of your question paper Okay of this
200 mcqs will move around
clinicals okay and 30% is will move
around
Basics and this happens in more than 90%
of cases in in the last 20 exams of ini
C 10 years every year you have two exams
so last 20 exams 10 years if you analyze
in more than 90 percentage of cases your
question paper is more inclined to the
clinical subjects okay so it's not a
balanced preparation that that we
regularly focus in neat examination we
go for a Balan preparation because
everything has a equal weight is the
blueprint they give the blueprint and
they follow the blueprint clear right
clear till this
point nothing if if I'm talking about
inic in in is for 200
questions okay and uh this exam is a
timeline based exam that whatever the
new software which already introduced
into the website so it's a timeline
based exam most of your previous
question papers also I'm trying to
provide in the new software so your
entire question paper is being splitted
into four
parts each part is going to have 50
mcqs and each part is going to have 45
minutes so first 45 minutes you'll be
accessible to the first 50 questions
only next 45 minutes next 50 questions
last 45 minutes last 50 questions clear
right this is very very clear right very
important
pattern and every right answer in the
inic is going to give you plus one Mark
and every wrong answer in inic is going
to give you minus 1/3 Mark and your
result of
in is available as
percentile that is the number of marks
you got compared to the topper for
example first
[Music]
ranker first
ranker will have
100% compared to the next one next one
second ranker may get
99.95 marks of the first ranker so he
rank will be given as 99.5 so in the
website you have apart from the marks
there is a column called as personel
okay so for in you have to see the
personal from now clear clear till this
point okay okay so next we'll be going
to the next topic so as already said
inic Focus
will be more on clinicals that is you
have 70 percentage of clinical questions
means clinical
subjects and 30 to 35 percentage of the
questions which moves on the basic
Sciences it is not mandatory but
preferably uh in most of the situations
this is what happening and if you check
out uh a change in the pattern in the
last couple of years of inct there are
more
repeats one there are more repeated
Concepts repeats in the sense same
question same
option same options if you're already
done with repeats properly perfectly
then you can go with the same answer you
get a mark and these things are very
very easy in the ex examination Hall the
second one is repeated concepts for
example an endodontist uh like for
example like an endodontist is preparing
so the same endodontist preferably
prepare the next session proper also so
he may have a choice where he loves to
give questions for example he's giving a
question on irrigations irrigation
Solutions preferably there is a high
chance that the irrigation Solutions
question can come but not the same
question okay right so similarly uh what
my suggestion is okay so while you are
doing repeats make sure you are perfect
with the entire concept of repeats it's
not only like a particular question
answer because most of us uh we we
regularly all to read question answer
mode of reading okay so along with the
question and answer what I'm suggesting
is you need to have an overall glance of
that particular area particular topic
okay so how uh you should be clear with
the entire topic not only that question
that's what I mean okay right so
repeated Concepts repeated questions is
the first thing that you have to focus
on in inct so if if you ask me what is
must do so according to your schedule
what is must do is one is repeats all
the repeats of every subjects preferably
from 2010 to
2024 March has to be done one second one
is repeated Concepts so every subject
has a particular repeated Concepts means
the questions are frequently coming from
that area so you should be perfected
perfect with those repeated concept the
third important thing what I monitored
is
classifications
inct always prefer to take
classifications particularly new
classifications bouncer classifications
or regular classifications they give
questions on regular classifications
which I feel is memory
based the next one is yes of course uh
there is a slight variation but in most
of the question papers you have diagram
based so you have diagram based
questions of course you have you you
have access to one of the folder called
as diagram based so in which all the
subjects papers will be activated and
make sure you try to revise this a
number of times and we'll be having uh a
diagram based uh quick revision session
also uh whenever it is possible so we'll
be doing that so diagram base has to be
given proper importance apart from
diagram based or the sub subcategory of
diagram based instrumentation is very
very
important okay so what instrumentation
the first instrumentation is pero okay
so make sure you're done with the
instrumentation video of pero very very
important must do each and every line
each and every diagram you should be
very very clear next one in OS also you
have instrument Parts okay you have all
the instrument Parts video which I have
clearly given in the schedule so all the
instrument Parts particularly the
devices or tubes that are used in your
emergency Ward ICU room are very very
important all those are covered
elevators suturing techniques everything
are covered so all the diagram based
stuff of your os are very very important
I'm talking particularly focusing on
instrumentation then instrumentation of
cons we have done clearly important
instrumentation of endo clearly done
important of course you have lots of
uh instrument based videos in your Oro
top to bottom has to be done Oro
instruments are very very important then
of course a little bit of pedo so apart
from this again
da da okay so your color plates of
Da your col color plates of Da are
important okay so apart from the
instrumentation the next one is
histopathology histopath uh I want you
to focus on Dental histology histology
diagrams very important oral pathology
important you have videos on oral path
and general path you have videos on
General path okay so and a little bit of
micro okay histopathologies are
important very very important so they're
asking questions on these areas okay
right the next comes is
uh uh a little bit of
SRS Sr ship papers okay so few Sr ship
papers are available in your dental bels
and even in dentist also they have not
exclusively given sship papers but most
of the sship questions were already
covered along with the latest question
papers so in in your dental pulse after
a particular subject you have something
called as latest question papers in
which few of the questions are neat few
of the questions are inic and a few of
questions are sship they have clearly
mentioned sship which they have given so
these sship
Concepts uh there was a little drop in
the last 3 to four years of need examin
uh ini C so we don't find more sship
previously we used to have lots of sship
questions but as we are preparing for an
entrance in a in a customized pattern so
we cannot take risk regarding that so I
want you to cover whatever Sr ships are
available whether it is on the website
whether it is in the discussion pattern
I'll try to include few Sr ship which
are more inclined to the concepts which
are repeated in ini and followed by uh I
I'll try to cover whatever whatever is
there I'll try to provide the access on
the website so whatever you can do from
your site please try to focus on the
sship areas and try to cover whatever
whatever the limited access we have
related to the SR
ships then few areas okay are are being
repeated from your mdms inic previous
papers which are a little bit inclined
to Dentistry not not randomly something
which is completely a bouncer for a
dental student but there few areas like
pharmacology particularly anesthesia
because an athesia is a very very
important topic okay local as well as
general so I want to add anesthesia
local as well as general anesthesia are
very very important so such areas
inclined to head and neck part of your
Anatomy inclin to basics of your
biochemistry physiology or medicine okay
regularly general surgery they're not
touching but general surgery inclin to
oral surgery areas some areas are being
picked from your uh medical friends Ms
and MD bers of your in C and they are
being given but I'll keep a filter to
that because it's very difficult for us
to do those papers so I'll keep a filter
to that and I'll try to teach few
important Concepts uh which were
previously given to us and which can be
given to us also I'll keep a filter and
try to give access to those areas also
so that is one important apart from
anesthesia which is a exclusively
separate topic that you have to take
very seriously into consideration okay
so I want you to cover few areas of MD
and Ms
areas that what I provide don't don't
randomly pick everything and don't read
that that's going to make your
preparation more tricky so I'll keep a
filter and I'll try to provide few areas
and try to follow that and few other
areas where inic is frequently focusing
on is a logical questions okay you see
the question may be so tricky but if you
check out the options it is more logical
if you keep some presence of mind some
common sense you can come out with the
right answer with the logic the second
one is
emergencies that is your medical
emergencies your drug interactions
Dental drug
interactions your ICU stuff particularly
your anesthesia that's what I'm talking
anesthesia
incubations all the emergency procedures
your tracheostomies your endot tral
tubes all the tubes in the body so
emergency area uh so they are asking
more questions related to that emergency
area so make sure you try to cover those
in a little bit about the latest uh
information latest information or latest
stuff but collecting this is so
difficult okay so this is uh completely
out of box so I don't uh I don't
recommend this to read the latest
updates but here and there I'll try to
discuss few important latest trending uh
topics which are very very important uh
from a a general uh dentist point of VI
or a general doctor point of view to
Dentistry where they can throw the
questions but preferably latest
information uh may not be a big source
of reading but rest of like for example
like in the last few trends like there
are high chances of questions on
covid okay after covid they're asking
questions on covid but you check out
your books whatever you follow like for
example dentist or dental pul or
whatever book you read the the
accessibility for for those areas is
very very minimal so but they are asking
questions so that's what I mean or else
like I just want to focus on some
important topics like implants they're
asking questions
latest lasers they're asking questions
okay so like for example
Aesthetics facial Aesthetics they're
asking question Dental Aesthetics
they're asking
question or for example
aliners so what a few latest things that
are happening but if you check out the
access of the content to us the content
of access to the content to us from the
sources of the books whatever we read is
very very limited for most of these uh
uh things right these things so such
areas they are asking questions but what
depth we should read we don't have a
limitation for that so here and there
during uh discussions or during paper
discussions or during the exams so we
are going to give some questions on
these areas as a new Concepts so you
need to make a note of it learn it
luckily if you get a question that's an
extra Edge for you in the examination
Hall so these are mandatory things that
we have to do along with the regular
schedule of a particular subject okay so
what is the first most important thing
in this is the first most important
thing is the repeats okay so you have to
do repeats from 2010 to 2024 and that's
what I'm telling like this time we are
going to have a regular discussions lots
of lengthy live uh video based
discussions so that we'll try to cover
uh the subject integratedly we'll try to
revise it I want every one of you apart
from your regular preparation please do
spend a quality of time with the live
session
that what we regularly take okay let it
be gar or me or prsh or sahti whoever is
taking so please try to integrate and
lend that so that you can cover and give
a Best Shot for inic as well as in this
process of giving inic you are going to
cover the major content that is required
for the neat examination which will be
in the March 2025 clear clear for
now clear for now so individually what
to be done everything I'll try to help
but uh the plan is very simple like
people who are done with the subject
subjects are already done so whatever
checklist we have done like for example
if you ask me like anotomy general
anotomy what you are going to do for
General anotomy my suggestion is very
simple General anotomy whenever you
revise let it be inct let it be NE
whatever it is I want you to do the
worksheet it's very simple like do the
worksheet finish it or what you have to
do do the worksheet so whatever you have
worksheets final worksheets do it for
example surgery I think you may prepare
a short notes okay do the surgery short
notes apart from this there are few
other areas must do areas I'll be giving
you on the group in a timeline based
pattern so you can plan accordingly okay
right so shall we go with the uh modules
like what I have prepared for
you and all the question papers I'll try
to provide in uh in in the parts of
sessions like 2 uh till 2018 20189
uh your aim is only for 90 mcqs so from
2010 to 2018 19 that 18 years question
papers very easy to do there are only 90
mcqs per question paper like for year
you'll be having 180 mcqs 90 Plus 90
probably it will be difficult for you to
do from after 2019 where the question
paper is being increased to 200 now you
have more questions per year you'll be
having 200 plus 200 400 but when you're
are solving those areas like 2010 to
2018 19 or 20 till 20 20 it is very easy
you hardly have 180 questions per year
and it it's going to take a very minimal
time because most of the questions are
very simple and direct you can finish
them fast clear guys
done okay next jumping into the modules
what I have prepared for this
is okay right uh like focusing on the
students who are already part of conquer
it's very simple so the first one is
sergical module okay the surgical
module so most of the surgical modules
subjects are included in the present
schedule that is one is OS is included
in the present schedule Anatomy is
included in the present schedule and the
previous Grand whatever you have given
like 20 days back it includes pero okay
and people who are not done with pero or
people who are not done with general
surgery try to focus on it so first 10
days plus one we are going to focus only
on these areas and I strongly believe
that most of you are already done with
OS and anotomy at least like most of you
okay who are there like 100 odd students
were there attending it as live few of
you will watch it as a recorded version
but what's my suggestion is I hope
you're clearly done right you're done
and few of you are done with pero also
so you have only general surgery and
that's what I'm telling general surgery
is a subject which is of faded okay for
example among these subjects which has
strong strong base in your final exam is
oral surgery followed by pero pero and
oral surgery are very very very very
very important for in compare with
general surgery and anotomy and among
the first module the least important
subject is general surgery okay the
least important I'm not asking you to
quit the subject I'm asking you to spend
a little bit less time with General
surgy but that's what I'm telling
general anesthesia is important that's a
part of your general surgery but we can
do it in Pharmacology or we can we are
doing it in oral surgery that is
secondary right clear right first model
surgical model the most important
subject is or oral surgery which is done
recently by you so the first module is I
feel like for most of you but people who
have started preparation late for most
of you the first module is very very
cool because recently in the last one
one and half month 45 days back if you
start preparation with MDS conquer I
strongly believe that you're done with
OS you're done with Anatomy you're done
with pero so the only thing is a little
bit of general surgery you have to do so
the first modu is very very cool and
comfortable okay by the time I want you
to acclimatize yourself adapt to the
schedules okay adapt to heavy reading
pattern
okay that's what I'm telling I'm giving
a personal suggestion to most of the
Maharashtra interns who are going to
finish their internship Maharashtra
Kerala as well as Tamil Nadu few areas
of Tamil Nadu so they're going to finish
their internship in less than month a
month or 40 days it's nothing wrong you
can take break now stretch your
preparation stretch your preparation for
fulltime okay make sure you try to spend
as much as time as possible with the
books that is very very important you
should spend most of your time with the
books okay in it is something like
you need to spend most of your time uh
with the book and focus you should read
for more time uh you should organize the
stuff and read for more time so first
moduel I think it's very clear right so
if you start preparation 45 days back I
feel like you have left over with only
one subject so you can you can push
yourself to the module two along with
the module one okay reading is not same
for all of you people who are clear with
module one yes you can jump into the
module two just just keep three or four
days for the revision of all these
subjects confidently and you can plan
accordingly next module two is going to
be your oral module so where I included
oral path oral medicine combined
together one subject Radiology is
recently done okay and oral path and
oral medicine will be going with the
regular schedule again okay once we are
done with this particular module
starting the things from September 5th
September 5th the subject which we are
going to start is oral path and oral
medicine so that is how I tried my best
to combine both the things like even if
you're prepared for inct you are not
leaving the regular schedule of the
conquer which is there for need 2025
clear guys so from September 5th after
September 4th exam of your regular
schedule we are going to start oral path
and oral medicine that is the same
subject which I tried integrated here
and oral Radiology was recently covered
oral Anatomy we are covering now and of
course cool cool composed subject is
oral histology so there's nothing too
heavy okay the only thing is you need to
finish your oral path oral medicine fast
if you're reading 5 hours 6 hours per
day I want you to stretch to 10 hours
you're reading 10 hours per day I want
you to stretch to 12 to 13 hours that is
simple very simple so if you stretch
oral path and oral medicine Radiology is
recently done oral Anatomy we are doing
in the present schedule so oral Anatomy
is done you are left over with only oral
hystology that I'll try to help
you to do it in maybe one and half day
two days or sufficient if you're already
done it's okay hology will take half a
day if you are not done hology will take
may take two to two and half days okay
right
clear okay then goes the next module for
the next after 20 22 days we're going
with the next model the next moduel is
mainly the medical model okay what you
can do is if you're clear with one and
two you can start three if you feel this
moduel is going to create a big burden
for you what you can do is very simple
okay for example you're
reading 10 to 12 hours per day I want
you to keep two days every I mean like
every day two hours so 10 + 2 you can
split it so every day two hours you can
keep for this medical
module I told you Basics are questions
are less but most of the basic questions
in your in C are integrated questions
okay so they integrate all these
subjects that is your medicine path
ology pharmacology okay physiology and
microbiology they integrate together
they give questions on this areas okay
right one thing is you can you can do
your modules according to the schedule
second thing
is to a dental student I feel like among
the five modules the most trickiest
model is going to be the third model so
what my suggestion is if you're reading
like 14 hours you can make it as 11+ 3
if you're reading 10 hours you can make
it as 8 plus 2 if you're reading 12
hours you can make it as 10 plus 2 if
you're reading 6 hours you can make it
as 5 + 1 according to that you try to
give a part of time for this particular
model that is how I have done the
schedule for you because uh recently in
the last modules we have done git and
drenal respiratory we have done okay so
we have done lots of things right so in
this particular module we are doing CVS
so we are doing it okay so similarly I
want you to split and add and plan
accordingly or else you follow the
schedule whatever you can cover you
follow the schedules third model is
definitely a little bit tricky and
questions in in C also the trickiest
questions will be coming from this
particular
model the next one is fourth model is
preventive and Prosthetics okay out of
which all the subjects are very very
important okay there's nothing no
subject to be neglected no subject to be
left over Community is at most important
pedo integrated to Ortho is very
important Prosthetics plus implants is
very very important so it is a
preventive prosthetic module okay so do
plan accordingly and the last module is
the most comfortable and easiest module
for us that is your operative Dentistry
Endo your dental materials and your
biochemistry okay so this is how I have
splitted the modules each module is
going to have 10 + one days according to
the schedule but you now I'll be posting
this PDF onto the group so now you
prepare like what subjects you are good
at come let's come out with the rating
so out of 10 rating so for example
recently I'm done with ar I'm done with
with surgery so I want to drop nine out
of 10 for surgery uh general surgery I'm
not so confident so five out of 10 for
surgery anotomy also recently done I'll
keep nine out of 10 pero recently done
but it is almost like one month so I'll
keep eight out of 10 so you prepare a
schedule like this and plan accordingly
okay and of course you come out with
your plan you can discuss with the
mentor and you can take the particular
calls here what are the extra things
that we are going to do is yes the group
is going to have a particular aspect
because we prepared a separate inic
group so every day you'll be having a
half an hour to 1 hour work on the group
apart from the regular in sessions so
once you have a live session or once I'm
giving a PDF asking you to take the
print out we are going to discuss that
PDF that PDF may include diagrams that
PDF may include questions that PDF may
include few important key points or that
FD up may include medical repeats sship
repeats whatever it is so the group
apart from the regular schedule like for
example you're reading 1 hour so I want
30
minutes to one hour of every day of you
for the ini C group session we will be
having the papa discussion that's what
I'm telling like previous questions Papa
discussions present grants or mock exams
so we'll be having mock exams we'll be
having lots of discussions focusing on
the areas of inic
clear guys
clear clear with the
plan okay the next important thing is uh
the Moto the Moto of giving in C the
Moto of giving in C is to know the
pattern is to test your abilities test
your abilities before going to the need
examination because there are many
interns okay who has given uh
examination
long long back okay probably in the 12th
standard you have given the entrance
examination and followed by you have
given lots of uh uh Theory examinations
but not an McQ based exam the approach
of Mind towards an McQ based exam is
going to be slightly different so that
is the reason why I strongly recommend
everyone to give
in it you may or may not get a rank but
in is going to clear your view that what
you should read how you should be on the
day of exam or how should you be one
week before the exam what to be done in
the one month before exam how you should
be thinking while you are giving
examination because giving an
examination in your room in your home
from the MDS conquer website is
different for giving an examination in
the center okay in a in a metropolitan
City so so why we are giving or why I am
forcing you to give this examination is
to know the pattern primary the primary
reason second one is to crack the seat
okay but as we know inic has a very
limited number of seats the seats are
very very limited number you hardly have
maybe 20 or 25 seats okay and chances
will be high for people I mean like of
course you know in India it is being
splited into 50 percentage 50 percentage
open category for example if 20 seats
are there open category people will get
20 seats and reservation will be 20 SE I
mean like 10 plus 10 20 seats total you
have 10 reservation and 10 open category
so people particularly people who are
having reservations of OBC or ews
reservations or you have an st or an sc
reservation I want you to be more
cautious more
careful okay because the competition I'm
not telling that the competition will be
less in your particular category or
group but compared to an open category
student people who has reservations has
a better age for example an open
category student getting a 25 rank yes
chances of getting a seat is less than 5
percent is 25 all India 25 in C in in
the upcoming session but a 25 rank
student a overall 25 rank student if you
have a category there is a high chance
that you can end up with the seat so all
the people who has reservations
particularly St or SC or ews or OBC okay
make sure I want you to be more focused
precise reading extra efforts I'm not
discouraging the open category students
but I'm telling the reality the ground
reality because there are few people
who always keep a barrier this exam is
not to my limit this exam is very
high-fi exam this exam is like an
Einstein based exam there is nothing
like that everything is a normal exam
everything is given by a dental student
but that's what I'm telling like few
people there are few few zones of people
who repeat the exams more number of
times than the other zones of people
okay you see intern giving exam for the
first time repeater may be giving exam
as an intern followed by repeater but I
personally have my
friends and my students who give exam
more than five to six times so these
people who give exam more than five to
six six times because their call of
giving exam repeatedly is different
their commitments are different their
ideology is different so these people
the comfortable they have the comfort in
the examination center because trust me
a person who has given exam repeating
the exam for three to four years they
may have given six or seven rounds of in
C okay so that is a different strategy
but that's what I'm telling like a
person who is giving exam for the first
time or person who has given exam five
years back and now trying to repeat the
exam I my strong recommendation for you
to take this exam just know what is
happening how how you should travel to
the center okay how you should travel to
the center how you should be careful
about the day before exam because most
of the centers of inic and eat
examinations will be similar the pattern
will be similar most of the patterns
because now neat is also being modified
right so most of the patterns of in and
neat are similar so there's nothing
wrong you can give it and this exam does
not have any big barrier barrier is only
for the people who are repeating this
exam again and again or people who are
stretching their preparation at a
stretch for the long 12 months or maybe
a little bit of barrier will be there
it's not a barrier big barrier for the
people who has started the race six
months or seven months back no no
barrier okay you are equally compated
and you you can equally comparatively
you you can also give this examination
so first of all remove the ideology IM
is not my cup of coffee
remove that ideology everyone deserve to
have anything in your life okay like for
example you see like no no is my not not
my level no no may not be your level now
or Taz banara may not be your level now
okay even when I was an intern it not my
level but a day will come that you are
going to occupy your seat or that you
are going to occupy your pride over
there okay everyone will have their day
it's just like you need to wait for that
day all right
so you're something like waiting for
your day so don't underestimate yourself
don't keep a barrier yourself I am I
want to restrict myself to this I want
to restrict myself to this or I want to
be like this so don't keep any sort of
barriers you're something which is
unmagnified which is undefined okay so
there is no limitation to growth it is
all you can change your fate okay right
so first of all remove that barrier work
hard I see like few of the maharash in
are already reached the offline Center I
can see the different energy levels okay
so let's work together okay the team has
a different plan this year uh in in
pushing you to in C so that's going to
give you a little bit of confidence that
makes your path easy for your upcoming
neat exam clear guys any any doubts you
have any question answer anything
question answer this is just a brief
glance like I'll be I'll be posting the
PDF and uh anyway the first subject is o
o is recently done for most of you the
first two to three days you can relax
plan everything accordingly and you can
launch okay you can launch your missile
because you're done with OS you're done
with anotomy recently okay so two four
to five days is in your hand okay so in
this two to three days you plan fully
you plan accordingly come out with
discuss with the mentor I am ready to
discuss with you there's any
modifications to be done we'll be doing
the modifications we'll be giving a good
shot for the upcoming in C the target is
not to do this or do that but a best
shot a good shot if it is not giving a
seat what it should give you it it
should motivate you let it be okay let
I'm not getting a seat okay very cool
but the exam should motivate you the
exam should push you the exam should be
as a target for which you are running so
that in this running process I want you
to cover more syllabus seriously
obediently okay with with the fear and
anxiety you can push yourself to cover
more syllabus that's going to make your
path very easy for your upcoming neat
exam so I strongly recommend people who
are eligible for this exam please try to
give this exam okay at any cost this
this is this definitely is going to help
you for your upcoming neat 2025 okay
clear guys
done done
okay okay okay okay U any anything any
any specific things you have yes inct
folder will be open
it's already open yes I I ask the team
to convert your previous inic question
papers into the latest module into the
latest pattern latest software so that
you'll be having all 200 question papers
splitted into uh four four parts each of
50 and with 45 so that you can feel that
pattern okay so make sure you try to
give exams the main Moto why I'm
planning for this particular batch uh is
uh to have a paper discussion
after the after the classes if there is
a paper discussion I strongly believe
that paper discussion is not required
every question is having its own
explanation if a paper discussion is
there what I strongly believe after
discussing with few of my students and
few of my staff is I feel like people
will give exam if Papa discussion is
there with that phobia to attend the
papa discussion I feel like people will
give this exam what is your opinion
regarding this
maybe like we we'll plan this paper
discussions in a according to the
schedule in applications are not at out
once they're out I'll I'll update you so
don't worry about
that inct test series will start from
tomorrow that's what I'm like I'm
discussing the schedule now so it's
already started that's what I'm telling
like OS anotomy so I'm just trying to to
combine the previous schedule with the
schedule which is going to start from
tomorrow so that you will be feeling so
comfortable because you're done with the
most of the subjects recently on your
regular schedule which are part of your
module one clear
done CH anything
more you just try to drop a message to
me I I'll add you on the
group okay guys all the best take care
let's start with all the positive energy
okay and if you have any doubts
regarding uh uh regarding to take a
break from the college few dilemas
because whenever you're asking someone
who is very close to you near to you
senior or
something they may not give an
appropriate suggestion to you instead of
that they may keep a phobia to you so my
suggestion is whenever you are taking
suggestion okay don't trust anyone that
is what now now you
see you see the things are turning so
worst in our community community let's
talk about India Let It Be entire world
is like that but it is more clumsy in
India okay so uh I mean like it sounds
too odd in few situations like whatever
happened recently whatever happening in
our in our community or everything like
so let's take someone who is more
reliable so let's interact with someone
who is more reliable you can trust your
father okay right you can trust your
father you can trust your brother you
cannot trust anyone right only two
persons you can trust is if you have a
father you have a brother you can trust
them similarly when you're preparing
also yes you can trust anyone you can
trust the senior you can trust your co-
aspirant you can trust anyone but the
most trustworthy person is your Mentor
luckily if you have access to your
Mentor it is
always good to talk with the mentor
spend some time talk with the mentor
know what is right what is wrong know
whether you're going in the right
direction whether you want to implement
some new things the best person that you
can trust is your Mentor is your teacher
you can trust anyone but the best one is
how you trust your father in the process
of your entire life as a girl okay the
only person who can trust 100 perent is
is your Mentor because he always thinks
about the positive side of
you okay guys done bye-bye see you

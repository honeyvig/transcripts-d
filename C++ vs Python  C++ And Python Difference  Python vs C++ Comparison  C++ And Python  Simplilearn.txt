hey everyone welcome to this tutorial by
simply learn in this session we will
learn about two popular languages
that is c plus plus and python
and the major differences between these
two programming languages
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
first we'll have a look at what is c
plus plus its syntax and what is c plus
plus used for
then we'll move to what is python its
syntax and what python is used for then
we'll compare the two languages based on
different parameters that is features
performance simplicity of language
memory management and at last salary
comparison
so let's start first is what is c plus
plus
c plus plus is a programming language
that was introduced by john strusstrop
in the year 1979 at new jersey
earlier it was called c with classes
instead of c plus plus because it was
created as an extension of c language
c plus is general purpose programming
language that means it is used to build
software in a wide variety of
applications
it has object oriented features like
classes inheritance and abstraction
but c plus plus also supports functional
programming and procedural programming
which makes c plus as multi-modal
programming language
now let's have a look at the syntax of c
programming language
first is class
it can be defined as a blueprint that
describes the behavior of object or we
can say class is a collection of objects
class is defined with keyword class and
it has its own members called member
functions or methods
then variables and constructors etc
next is methods or functions
it is one of the most important part of
c plus plus programming
because it is used to write logics data
manipulation and all other important
operations take place inside method
and method can be easily used by
invoking it whenever we need
we can give name to the function or
method along with the return type and
then inside the brackets we can write
the operations or logic
coming to objects
it can be defined as instance of a class
if an object is created of a certain
class then that object can be used to
access data members and functions of
that class using the dot operator
it can be done by writing the name of
the object preceding the dot operator
and then function name following round
brackets
next is instance variable
these are those variables which are
defined inside the class but they are
outside the methods
they basically belong to the object and
every object has its own unique set of
instance variables
so now
let's understand
what c plus plus is used for
c plus plus is able to handle the
complexities of 3d games and it also
provides multi-layer networking which
makes it capable for development of
gaming systems and 3d games
c plus also used for making advanced
software applications for example adobe
spotify and youtube have different parts
written in c plus
c plus plus is used for making compilers
because it is considered closer to the
hardware
therefore it is used for making
compilers
and as i said that is closer to the
hardware so that is why it is preferred
for making gadgets like smart watches
medical instruments etc
it is also used for making database
management software for example mysql is
written in c plus
c plus plus also plays a part in making
or writing the operating systems for
example microsoft windows operating
system and mac operating system has some
of its parts written in c plus
now let's understand what is python
python is a programming language that
was introduced by
guido von rossum in the year 1991
it was named after a tv show monty
python's flying circus
its 2.0 version was introduced including
the new features like garbage collection
for memory management etc
it is high level object-oriented
programming language from the starting
point of the development of python one
of the main intent was
that it should be easy to read and
simple to understand and use
and python is known for its easy and
simple learning experience
python supports multiple programming
models including procedural object
oriented and functional programming
it also contains features like dynamic
binding and dynamic
typing python is dynamic language with
high level data types that means
development take place faster in python
than any other programming languages
like java and c plus
now let's have a look at the syntax of
python
first is line structure
a program in python is divided into
number of logical lines
each logical line ends by a token new
line
now a logical line is created from one
or more than one physical line
and a physical line is basically a set
of characters
in python a new line depicts new
statements but sometimes we have to
split the statements and it can be done
by using backslash and using triple
quotes around the string
commands in python is used to store tags
at right places in the code it is
basically used to explain sections of
code
it is declared using hash symbol
next is docstring
docstring is also used to explain the
code in python
the programmer can inspect them at
runtime its boundaries are determined by
using three double quotes and inside
these double quotes we can write or
explain
next is indentation in python
indentation means the space is at the
beginning of code line
if there are no space it will show
syntax error
we can indent using space or number of
tabs
quotations quotations are used to create
string objects in pythons
if we use single quote at the beginning
of string then we must end it with
single quote itself and same goes for
double quotes as well
identifiers are used to uniquely define
an element in python
now that element can be variable
function class etc
there are some rules associated with it
an identifier can only begin with
uppercase
a to z and lowercase a to z or an
underscore
that's it
next is variables
python is dynamically typed language so
we don't define type of variable
it is decided on the basis of value we
can assign a string to the variable and
integer to the variable it will print
them both
last is string formatters
this method is used to format a string
into a nicer output
now
let's understand what is python used for
python is popularly used in robotics and
is one of the language that is commonly
used in robotic process automation or
rpl
in the field of automation python is
extensively used because it helps in
making the automation
systems fast and efficient
python is also used in web development
because it has a lot of frameworks which
reduces the task a lot and because it's
easy to learn and use so debugging is
not difficult for web development in
python
python is widely used in modern
technologies like artificial
intelligence and machine learning
because it has a great library and its
flexible its speed of execution and
readability purpose give it a plus
it also acts as a supporting language
for software development purpose
dropbox is a fine example of it
python was used to build dropbox desktop
app
libraries like pandas and numphie makes
it popular for data analysis purposes
because these libraries support a lot of
data analytics tasks
now
let's move on to the features of c plus
plus and python
c plus plus is a portable language here
portable means we can use same piece of
code in different environments
python is a platform independent
language we can run the same code on
different platforms and it is an open
source language
c plus plus allows dynamic memory
allocation that is it allows to allocate
memory dynamically
python has large standard library and
because of that we don't have to write
the code for every single part
c plus is object-oriented language
unlike c it has concepts like
abstraction polymorphism inheritance etc
python is also object oriented language
and has high readability features
c plus plus is fast and efficient
language
python is slower than c plus plus but in
python it is easy to read and maintain
the code
now that as we know what c plus plus and
python are let's go ahead and have a
look at the major differences between
the two
so here we will compare both the
languages on the basis of performance
c plus
is statically typed that means the type
of its variables are known at compile
time and its programs are pre-compiled
which makes it faster than python
on the other hand python is dynamic
language
and is interpreted that means the lines
of code are transferred to executable
code at runtime which consumes some time
coming to simplicity of language
c plus plus is bit complex when it comes
to simplicity of language and it has
more syntax rules as well as program
conventions
python has simple and easy to learn
syntax moreover its features are easy to
use which allows us to write short and
readable code
moving on to the memory management
in c plus plus memory management takes
place manually as it doesn't have any
garbage collector
moreover it uses pointers which makes it
more vulnerable to memory leaks
python provides automatically programmed
memory management as there is garbage
collector in python
coming to the last factor that is
comparison in terms of salary
the average salary of c plus plus
developer is 71
677 dollars per annum in u.s
and in india the salary is 8 lakhs 10
927.
in case of python
the average salary of a developer is 78
sixty seven dollars per annum in u.s
and in india the salary of mid-level
python developer is nine lakh nine
thousand
eight hundred eighteen
so this was the comparison between c
plus plus and python
and with that we have come to the end of

I know that the PMP was actually the
first course you had on your platform
when you set up your very successful
edtech company you also see people who
are not in the right role so again when
I join a company I do not come with the
idea that I'm going to change the entire
management team you know it's not the
way it works I always try to maximize
the efficiency and effectiveness of the
team I have and give people the right
roles for them and a lot of that is
discussing with them talking to them in
the last two years once you have taken
over we see a lot of new Innovative
products coming out of PMI be it like
PMI Infinity PMI study hall PMI project
management co-pilot should PMI ATP
should be worried it's clearly our
ecosystem we call it the flywheel right
so how all the components of our
ecosystem working together for the same
objective to increase project success of
course atps are absolutely essential to
that ecosystem so not only you should
not be worried but you will see the
scope of what the atps will do expand
last decade or so a lot of new
profession came into being Investment
Banking is like a very celebrated
profession very rewarding data scientist
and product manager how do you see
project management profession
transformation project management is
about transformation it's about creating
something it's about making a move as
long as the the world will have things
to transform we will have project
professionals how do you see AI becoming
an integral part of project management
profession asking PMI to fight AI to
make sure that we can protect our job
that that's not realistic so I'm not
going to try that because it's a bad
idea I think what we need to think about
is how AI is a fantastic opportunity for
us as a profession stories well that's
what most of us have heard others tell
that's what we have probably H to
Growing Up well what makes a great story
maybe it's not that complex a simple
story with little incidents failures
roadblocks and those tiny Milestone that
need to be celebrated maybe it's as
simple as that join me on this journey
as I share uncommon stories of common
people right here with you keeping in
line with the theme of showcasing
uncommon stories of common people today
we have a very special guest let's
connect with Pier LMA the CEO and
president of PMI let's find out who Pier
is the former CEO of several reputed
organizations like conso data who
serving for over 17 years as a CEO of
ipsos one of the largest market research
companies present in over 90 countries
to becoming the CEO and president of PMI
what brought him to PMI how is PMI
making project successful in an era
dominated by artificial intelligence
what does this mean for the numerous
organ organizations government
institutions professionals and learning
platform let's dive into his leadership
tips and skills he would like to share
over to Pier thanks Pier for taking time
to join this podcast as simple as that
on this we share stories of success
stories of transformation I'm here to
speak with you about the transformation
Journey that PMI has gone through so
I've personally been associated with PMI
for more than 10 plus years and my
perception of PMI for the longest time
was that it's a RIT bureaucratic
government mindset kind of setup which
prescribes what to do and you follow
there was no two-way dialogue and that's
how was our way of working also we
hardly knew anybody in PMI for the
longest time except some field level
sales Executives based in India and here
you come now PMI has become a very
Innovative organization you are always
there on social media sharing views PMI
is talking about AI I would not have
imagined PMI talking about AI a few
years back right so more about like what
led to this transformation and while
talking about that I also want to know
that what made you join PMI as a CEO
because you have been a successful CEO
for so many different companies we had
so many different options to take up as
a new role So What attracted you to PMI
Mission and and this whole
transformation Journey you know what
this first of all thank you uh Krishna
for inviting me um and thanks for all
the great cooperation between simply
learn and and PMI over the years and I
know that PMP was actually the first
course you had on your platform when you
set up your very successful edtech
company um you know at this stage of My
Life um I accept a job when I think I
can help right so the most important
thing is I looked at the situation of
PMI and I thought I could help um on one
side I had a relevant experience you
know it's um in the knowledge sector I
spent my entire life yes in different uh
kind of Subs segment of the sector if
you want I worked in Consulting I worked
in publishing I worked in uh adtech I
worked in as you know in market research
uh I worked in a consumer Insight data
analytics and I had also started to work
in education and I come back to that so
knowledge sector for me it's what I've
been doing my entire life right talking
to smart people sometimes difficult but
intelligent and knowledgeable that's uh
what I've been doing my entire life uh
it was an organization the stage of
scaling up you know so we've been in
business for a long time since 1969 but
the need to scale up to globalize you
know this kind of a inflection point in
any company and I'm sure as an
entrepreneur you understand what I mean
right when you get to the point where
you don't have enough resources to do
what you need to do if you want to
become a real Global player but you
still need to do it right so that very
specific phase in a life of an
organization is something I've done many
times um so I thought I had the relevant
experience for that
PMI is also complex from a governance
standpoint you know we have elected
board members uh we have multiple
stakeholders PMI everybody feels they
own PMI if they're in project management
they have views about PMI and they want
to have a voice right so in my life I
worked for various types of governance
from listed companies to private Equity
owned to family owned I had worked for
nonprofit one time before with a similar
kind of governance so also there I felt
I had I had the experience and then if
you work in a global organization and
you have this ambition to be the leading
Authority for project management
worldwide then you need to have a some
Global Experience and from a personal
background my own family my own personal
story plus the life I've had from a
professional standpoint working in
different countries speaking different
languages um I thought I could really
help here and it was also the right time
for me you know I had just left a
company where I had spent many years and
uh I had I was bound by a non-compete so
I to change industry or do nothing for
15 months I tried to do nothing for 15
months after 15 minutes I got bored so
was the right time for me to start
something different I started to work in
education uh for a private Equity Fund
and uh when PMI came to me I thought
well that's a very interesting timing
for me and like I said I think I can
help so that's why I joined PMI so
thanks that's very very inspiring and I
can relate to you saying that you can't
sit without doing something even 15
minutes I know I think I'm also like
that so I can really relate to that
particular fact in mind so I get for you
that you were already successful you
wanted to have a mission and PMI Mission
attracted you and you could see the
impact like two years fast forward we
see the kind of changes happening in PMI
ecosystem but what I have realized as a
startup CEO and as an entrepreneur that
any transformation that you want to
bring within any organization it cannot
happen unless you have the right team
now when it comes to right team I think
whether you like it or not the way you
compensate your team the kind of
incentive structure that you put in
place also is a major factor now I also
know that PMI is a not for profit or
organization so there are limitation
when it comes to being not for profit I
see that you have attracted a strong A+
team in PMI after you came on board so
give us some of the those secrets that
how did you went about balancing the PMI
EOS of being not for profit and at the
same time getting the best a class team
that you can imagine yeah
it's interesting you say that because at
in my past professional life at one
point I joined a company that um uh just
after the first internet wave so they
had a they had set up a ntech company
made a ton of Acquisitions that had no
consistency and no coherence um and and
and the founders had left so that the
country was founded in France and they
had acquired companies everywhere in the
US in China all across Europe and they
left to London to pay less taxes
and they thought that the only thing
that would motivate people is to give
them stock options and the promise of
making millions right um and it actually
worked the problem is that the kind of
people it attracts is not always the
right people who are going to stay there
for the long run right actually I came
there not because of that but because I
had an interest for the business itself
and I felt again I could help in
integrating some of the components that
they had put together they completely
left at one point I became the CEO very
quickly myself and I tried to surround
myself with people who are not just
motivated by money you know that by the
way motivated by money you know when you
work for a nonprofit it's more like
being paid in bonds instead of high-risk
uh junk bonds or or it's like more being
paid in treasury bonds than pay being
paid in equity if you will so you have a
more guaranteed kind of
compensation but what drives most people
and I'm serious when I say that what
drives most people is not money and
money we pay very decently at PMI we are
um Benchmark we make sure we pay people
at the right level yes you don't have
the kind of upside you would have in a
company that gives you Equity but you
don't have the downside either you know
you have more stability as well and
frankly when you attract people you want
to attract people who are coming because
they are passionate about the mission
because they really want to make an
impact in the organization that they
join because they love working with the
other people on the A+ team as you call
it that's what really matters and I
don't have any advice to give to you of
course but in spite of people coming to
you for money make sure that they also
come because they're convinced about
education they're convinced about what
you're doing they love working with you
they love working with the rest of the
team and in the end this is what makes
us happy we all have minimum needs in
terms of financials maybe you do this
earlier in your career but at one point
what really drives motivation what
really drives passion is what you work
on and the people you work with I've
never had any problem attracting great
people in any company I've worked for
regardless of the governance regardless
of the compensation system I always pay
people what they deserve you know I
don't underpay anyone ever but it's
never based on that it's always based on
do we want to accomplish something
together so P tell me I think this
sounds too good to be true we all try
hiring the A+ team but we make our own
mistakes right sometime we get what the
person project himself or herself while
you are interviewing and while you're in
the hiring process but reality turns out
to be something different so what what
is your secret how how do you go you go
about checking your mission alignment
and whether figuring it out the person
is the right Fit for Your Role or not
I've made my own mistakes you know but
look when we um when I joined PMI um I I
had no preconception at all about the
people um about the people we had right
the leaders we had uh I always give
people a chance uh it's not even a
chance you know I I start with U um the
idea that anyone can probably find the
right job for them right it's very rare
that you can't find the right job whever
you are so my first objective is always
to try and find refine a little bit the
responsibilities of the people I have to
play on their strength and then to
assemble a team that can work together
so yes initially when I joined like in
any company some felt it was a little
hard to have to kind of re interview for
their jobs that's the way they they were
seeing it yes because whatever you've
done in the past I have to admit when I
come as a CEO I look at what people are
doing now right it's what they've done
is great but I want to see the future
and how this is going to work out so
some had to leave some decided to up out
uh but for many people in my leadership
team uh who were there at the time the
ones who stayed we changed their scope
right so sometimes we expanded their
scope because I felt they did not have
enough and they were limited in what
they could do sometimes we reduce their
scope because I thought they had too
much and they were losing focus and
maybe doing stuff that they were not the
best at sometimes we change their uh
scope and give their give them a
different job and then I tried to build
a right blend you know of experience of
background of profiles of personalities
as well and I'm actually after two years
it took me a long time after two years
I'm almost done there you know the first
thing I did is to Define an
organizational structure that I found
more effective than the one we had
before and then I started to talk to
people and make all the changes um my
senior leadership team is made of about
30 people the executive team is 10
people including myself the senior
leadership team is about 30 people we're
almost done there right we have a few
positions that are still open but we're
almost done there now my job is to work
on making it a real team right so it's
not just the individuals who have to
perform it's the whole team together if
you love sports you understand what I
mean if you're a major if you're a CEO
you completely understand what I mean
actually I'm going to Amsterdam tomorrow
night to meet with this team and set
expect and how I want us to work as a
team we've already started but we have
many new people so we have to work more
on that it has consequences of course
beyond the senior leadership team itself
because when you recruit new leaders
they will also change their own team and
do the same so you know piece by piece
you build a performance culture that I
hope uh you will see I mean you've
already seen and thanks for the great
feedback and I hope you will see even
more of that in the years to
come I I I I could see that I I feel it
right I'm not part of like I'm not
working for time for PMI but as as being
part of ecosystem I I could definitely
feel that A+ team kind of behavior now
that brings me to the next question that
PMI was has been there in existence for
almost 50 years now we had old guards
and you brought so many new leaders now
there are good people who get used to
working in a different way and you want
to change you don't want to change them
but you want to change their way of
working so how was that transition how
did you decided who needs to continue
who needs to be replaced and who needs
to be changed like is there is is there
any kind of like say Playbook that you
can share with us you know I have some
expectations um for certain functions
think of Finance you know for instance
so very quickly you see whether the
person is the right person for you or
not and if not you have to uh confront
it you know and and help them if
possible find a different role you know
but those positions are typically not
easy to move around right it's not like
you take your CFO and make them head of
sales you know that usually will never
work uh you also see people who are not
in the right role so again when I join a
company I do not come with the idea that
I'm going to change the entire
management team you know it's not the
way it works I always try to maximize
the U efficiency and effectiveness of
the team I have and and again give
people the right roles for them and a
lot of that is discussing with them
talking to them asking them what they
want to do understand what they're
really good at observe it and you will
see very quickly people up out
themselves right they typically tell you
you know this is too much for me is
going to be tooo much pressure I didn't
come from that for that or I had
different expectations or I want to keep
my scope um and then you know you find
ways to as smoothly as possible make
these changes and then uh focus a lot on
attracting the right people because as a
CO every time you recruit someone at a
senior level you're making a big
decision right it's not that you would
recruit so many of them in the end so
the few people who will surround you you
really have to think hard about how you
will best leverage them how you will
make them successful and how they will
fit with the rest of the team and that's
the toughest part because you can find
great people but building a great team
is another level of
challenge one of the challenge that I I
have also seen that lot of smart people
that think they are way too smart that
it's very difficult to make them believe
that 1 plus one is 11 not 1 plus one is
not two so it's easier said than done so
I think I now move on to the next
topic I love smart people by the way if
they are smart they should understand
the the benefits of being a team so I
don't give up on people who are smart
and difficult to work with I actually
work hard to make them easier to work
with and also work hard to make the
others understand how what they bring to
the equation right and let them be a
little different you know I'm not trying
to unify I used I used to work for a
company which is now Accenture right
it's inocent Consulting at the time and
we had those advertising where you had
all these fishes that looked alike and
went in the same direction I love that
conceptually but in fact that's not the
way it should work right we have to
leverage our differences not try to
eradicate them that's what makes a very
strong uh leadership team so P tell me
when it comes to spoke a lot about team
culture what is a non-negotiable virtue
when it comes to leaders or in general
somebody that you want to work in your
in your organization something that is
like non-negotiable and you also think
that that's something you can't teach
this is a vir either you have or you
don't
have uh so there's not so many things
you can teach right so I I most things
you can U you can teach the the problem
is the time you have right so when I
build a team and when I try to turn
around a company I don't want to spend
20 years fixing it right so even if you
see the potential in someone to fix uh
some of their weaknesses you don't want
these weaknesses to be like so far off
to an acceptable level of performance
that you will never get there in a
reasonable time frame right but
otherwise I would not make the statement
that you cannot improve I think I do
believe you can improve in absolutely
everything right now I do look at the
strength of people before their
weaknesses because I know the strength
can be used right away right so and I
try to put the strength at use in the
best possible way yes there are a few
non-negotiable Point um in the way we
behave as a team um
definitely so I want to make sure that
uh everybody understands that we
collectively own the responsibility of
making the organization work but that's
not incompatible with being personally
accountable so you cannot use the fact
that we need to collectively succeed to
explain why you personally fail you know
you need to adjust to these rules you
can't say I lost the game because of the
rules no you have to adjust to the rules
of the game and win you know but if you
don't respect the rules of the game then
you're not an acceptable player right so
that's non-negotiable for me I'm very
very strict about intellectual rigor
actually anyone joining my team at a
senior leader um level has to take a
critical thinking test
um if you don't score 100 you can still
join but there's a minimum level right
if it's too low it's going to be a big
big big red flag for me because it's
very difficult frankly at least for me
to work with people who don't respect
facts and who are not rigorous in the
way they derive conclusions and insights
and actions from facts right I want
people who know what they're talking
about who are precise who do not just
listen to their teams without checking
the facts you know who are very
objective and I I think it's a very
important discipline you know not just
for me but also in terms of the
reputation of the organization having
leaders who are reliable you know for
you as a partner do you want people who
tell you things that are not true or do
you want people who are analyzing facts
are precise objective you know that's
the kind of image I want my leadership
team to project right um and then I
would say um on top of all of that it is
very important for me to see leaders who
may uh disagree and and and fight and
and be sometimes not in agreement make
their points but then once we agree on
what we do it's very important to be
United and to Cascade things you know
you can't just be a great leader and a
great colleague and not take care of the
performance of your own teams right it's
very important for me that the people
who work with me Cascade the culture of
performance Cascade our objectives and
treat their own people right and develop
their people right so I really insist
that their role is to make sure that
whatever we do at a senior Le leadership
level will Cascade down the organization
and that everybody is going to be lifted
up you know not just raising the ceiling
that means having great people or a few
great people but paying a lot of
attention to raising the floor as well
the minimum level of performance that
will be delivered in the company I think
P this is like great all this great
suggestion now I want to move on to some
questions that I want to ask on behalf
of our ATP community so not so uh far
away in past the only artifacts that
atps used to care about is pimbo so
there's always a a project management
body of knowledge version coming up
we'll build curriculum around that and
start offering the training programs to
help people get PMP certified or or any
other credential like capm and so on and
I think couple of years back this
concept of PMI kit came into being that
okay you want to train you need to offer
PMI kit so some basic material that you
have to offer in while you're training
in fact before that sharing a pinbo as
part of the training material was not
mandatory prescription from PMI so so so
that change happened few years back that
was the first change but in the last two
years once you have taken over we see a
lot of new Innovative products coming
out of PMI be it like PMI Infinity PMI
study hall
PMI project management co-pilot so and
there are also prescriptions on what you
can do what you cannot do so one
question I wanted to like frankly ask
you from the community side that should
PMI at ATP should be worried that maybe
PMI is becoming hiring this a a team
they're launching new product so why
can't PMI itself do all deliver all
these training programs why do they need
atps to work with PMI first of all it's
interesting you said that before there
was only pmog because in fact it's not
true we had a a number of products that
is unbelievable and you probably don't
even know Krishna although you know us
very well uh and precisely our problem
is that we're going all directions and
and doing nothing with enough conviction
right you you can do a lot but you have
to if it stops when you can't have the
conviction to succeed right if it's just
to do stuff and then move to the next
thing and without any determination to
uh make it a success and and make it
robust robust and and and and and and a
real sizable activity then you should
not do it at all right so one thing and
i' go back to your ATP question
specifically but one thing we did with
PMI next um our our strategy is to be
very intentional about where we want to
play and where we don't want to play and
where are are where are the strengths of
PMI that we can leverage and where are
not the strengths of PMI one of the
strengths of PMI is clearly our
ecosystem we call it the flywheel right
so all the components of our ecosystem
working together for the same objective
to increase project success of course
atps are absolutely essential to that
ecosystem so not only you should not be
worried but you will see the scope of
what the atps will do expand um we're
launching a new version of uh uh ACP
very soon our adual certification um the
by the way I will announce this
officially soon so that's a
pre-announcement of the official
announcement um of course the atps will
have a big role in that part of our PMI
next strategy is to develop a set of
gold standard certifications so raising
the bar of what it means being a
certification the professional
certification beyond the micr
credentials beyond the certificates that
proliferate everywhere how do you make
sure that there is a very distinctive
standard that goes with apmi
professional certification that will
involve of course controlling the
quality of the training that is provided
so you can expect that atps will play a
bigger role compared to other ways for
people to train uh going forward you
know we want to Foster multiple options
for learners but we also want to ensure
quality and our atps are a very very
important step actually um the central U
component of that move that we want to
make I consider atps as fantastic
Partners I enjoy spending time with you
and your colleagues I do respect that
you have businesses to run and pressure
and competitive pressure I actually like
it I think it's a great reality check
for PMI you speak your mind you talk to
me as you as you think and that's very
useful for me at least as a CEO and I
think for my team as well so uh we we do
love our atps and you don't have to
worry about that yes of course PMI you
know is delivering now platforms to help
people do their jobs like PMI Infiniti
we want to provide a career-long um
Learning and Development opportunity
development can be volunteering through
project manages Without Borders the
activities we do there it could be
through our chapter so it's not just
about learning having some uh e-learning
courses developed by PMI as one of the
options that candidates can have either
through the atps or directly with us is
going to happen right so our atps will
see their importance growing in the
years to come and I hope you can feel
that as well in the way I engage with
you and I'm doing this not just because
I want you to be happy but because you
help me as well because you really give
me a good understanding of what's going
on on the ground with dates with
Learners with corporations and that's
very important well thanks P that's like
really very helpful so you just made an
statement and I completely agree that I
thought I knew PMI but frankly there are
lot of things I'm discovering about PMI
that I never knew like for example for
the longest time my impression of PMI
was that PMI does certify individuals
and PMI conducts events these are the
two ways in which you can engage with
PMI that that was my thought process was
and then couple of months back I noticed
one post on your LinkedIn saying that we
also accredit higher institutions I was
never aware about it so tell us
something more about like lesser known
facts about PMI that you think will be
evolve as future products from the PMI
side that that ATP should be aware
of no I mean it's very transparent in
our strategy right so we want to do
three things mostly um one of them is to
develop this U Community vetted or
expert vetted uh knowledge database that
can be leveraged by AI now so PMI
Infinity is a great example of that an
event is the same thing you know it's
the same thing it's a curated event with
experts that talk to the community so
that's one side of what we're doing um
Learning and Development all career long
is I just talked about that yes we will
do some but part of that of course is
done through um vetting and accrediting
external Partners we're not going to
train everywhere everyone in the world
but we want to increase quality we want
to increase diversity so yes part of
that activity and it's been there for a
long time and you didn't know it but we
do have a global accreditation Center
which basically provides accreditation
for um university programs mostly Master
degrees a few Bachelor degrees or
certificates that uh abide by certain
quality standards U usually the students
there are people who have already worked
who are already project managers they
get a degree um many of them come from
different countries you know this also a
way for them to uh to find a new country
a new life New Opportunities and we want
to make sure they understand when they
go through all the possibilities that
exist in the world in terms of going
after a degree in project management
that these degrees are U degrees of
quality about half of our programs that
we accredit we have accredited are in
the US and Canada uh half of them are
outside of North America so it's growing
actually pretty fast outside of um North
America we have some in India we have
some in Asia we have some in Europe and
we have some in all regions in the world
so uh going forward we will doing even
more of that we want to make sure we are
um helping the uh the people potential
project professionals navigate this
world of training and learning some of
them formal degrees some of them
certifications some of them courses and
help them find what is a um a content of
quality or a degree of quality and and
what is not right so that's what we're
doing it's not very different from what
we've always done we're just doing it
differently because the world has yes so
this p is this offer only to highed
institutions like a lot of atps have non
PMI based longer duration program so can
that also get accredited and become a
degree yeah you're actually asking a
good question we right now we don't have
a program for that but but I think uh
it's something we could certainly
consider uh and see how that would work
yes it's the same concept right what we
want to do here is to make sure we um
provide a guarantee you know we're
Brokers of trust that's what a
certification is about right you have an
employer you have a professional and
they have a common currency that tells
you both sides that you have a certain
acquire certain competencies so it goes
the same way with any training program
so I yes if if there is a way you know
it's a little easier to do for a Master
Degree for instance because it has a a
certain format so you can you can more
easily Define what is a a master um
program with quality and and and and one
which doesn't have the quality
requirements if if we talk about totally
variable formats and length and content
then maybe it's a little more
complicated but in principle it would be
great yes if PMI could also provide
accreditation for that kind of uh
learning programs you know the future is
not going to be just about University
degrees we all know that right you I
mean of course you know that at simply
learn but we have to um see a future
where people will learn uh all life long
and um and and and not necess
necessarily only uh degrees from
universities and so how do you put some
order in that not in the sense if you
want to regulate but um provide the
public and candidates and Learners with
the guarantee of quality that they are
looking for that they need and and the
same for employers
frankly so when you accredit this
Masters in project management kind of
degree program and if somebody's already
PMP or or any other certification from
PMI do do they get any credit when they
go for that kind of degree program at
least I'm not aware of if something like
that exist I don't know I think it would
completely depend on the University that
provides the program uh we cannot
control that uh yesterday I was at
George Washington University they have a
a master degree in project management
about 20% of their student already have
a PMP okay um but I think they still
have to go through the same number of
units and credits you know the the
people who go and to these programs they
really want to learn something anyway so
they're not necessarily interested in
trying to find ways to get their degree
faster um they just want to go to the
training um The Experience uh move to
Washington DC for a while and then maybe
build another life right so the reason I
was asking that if that was the case we
could refer such degree programs to our
students who are completing the
certification like successfully if you
go to our website you can go to
something called GAC Global
accreditation Center of PMI and you will
see all the list and I I'm happy to put
you in touch with a person in charge of
that Rebecca she's fantastic she knows
everything about all our programs well
definitely I'll do that P I want to come
back to this ATP question one more time
so this whole concept that there's a
principal body that owns something some
standard or some IP and partners working
with that body to like take out the same
con or scale the same concept globally
is a very established Model A lot of
people have done this model um in
different aspects of the business
business now there are one challenge
that most atps struggle with that how do
they differentiate themsel like let's
say a prospective student wants to come
to Simply learn or they want to go to
any other provider which we compete with
how what is your suggest how do you like
in idea Ideal World you see these
companies competing and what makes them
a a bigger partner of PMI or how can
they attract student we provide some
guidance of course and uh it's important
and also you need that because we change
our exams all the time so you need to
get this guidance you can't just uh you
assume that you can not change your
training and then have your students
pass when we change the exam regularly
to take into account the changes in the
profession like AI will be a very
important part of the next version of
the exam you know all that has to be uh
communicated to our ATP so definitely
there will be some level of U guidance
prescription and tools that you need to
use but overall the differen is in the
format you have uh is in the service you
provide and it's very different the
experience when you go to an
organization like simply learn it's
going to be very easy to use someone
like me I love e-learning you know I it
works for me very well because I can
work asynchronous whenever I want I
don't really need an instructor you know
I I I don't feel that way and it's not
recent it's always been like that but I
to completely understand and respect the
fact that we have people there are many
people who prefer a very um a very um
personalized service want to be in class
otherwise they don't have the discipline
want to communicate with others and so
some of that can be done virtually some
of that through study groups some of
that can be done in a class right in a
classroom we want to provide an
ecosystem that lets people choose what
is the best way for them to learn
remember in the end a certification is
just an exam but the journey is
important as well you know what you
learn in the process is so important as
well and the connections you make uh
some of that now can be made virtual
some of that cannot be made virtual you
you have to choose what works for you
and that's what we want for you that you
have the choice so now here I want to
talk about project managers who are the
very important part of our our ecosystem
so if if I see this whole project
management profession it ex it existed
for I don't ever since do we have
documented history somebody making
things happen but in the last I say last
decade or so lot of new profession came
into being Investment Banking is like a
very celebrated profession very
rewarding data scientist and product
manager and somehow this project
management profession kind of became
more like it it lost its like charm or
or glamour glamour if I have to say so
how do you see project management
profession transforming if I look at
from my perspective I think that it
always existed anything that you do
project management is always embedded
you can't deliver unless you manage it
well and everything is a project at end
of the day you know uh you're right to
say that project management has always
existed because in the end project
management is about transformation it's
about creating something it's about
making it the move right um and so as
long as the world we have
things to transform we will have project
professionals or people doing project
management and I do not expect the level
of transformation and change to slow
down right if anything it's we all know
it's accelerating and that's why by the
way PMI is growing and everybody's
growing in this profession in the end
what what you're touching is a little
bit different let's let's face it
sometimes there's a lack of recognition
you know so yes if you tell your uh
mother-in-law that you're an investment
banker maybe should be happy about that
I mean I'm not sure by way but some you
may think that she will be happy about
that you say you're a product manager
right now it's a little more edgy
because in Tech you know project
managers are called Product managers in
many cases part of that is because of
course as we know the the life cycle of
a project is not very clear products
evolve all the time so it's it's been
rebranded a little bit marketing matters
I mean each of us we need some
recognition you know some of us are more
sensitive to this than others but in the
end it's normal it's a human feeling
that is absolutely normal uh to want
recognition and if you're a project
professional whether you call yourself a
a product manager a project manager a
program manager portfolio manager
whatever transformation manager if you
manage projects you want to see this
recognition in my opinion and that's a
very important thing by the way because
when I joined PMI everybody was talking
to me when I was asking people what is
the problem here you know what are the
things we need to address everybody was
telling me well we need to be more
Global we need to focus more on social
impact we need to have more agile you
know our certification and products we
you know that kind of things we want to
develop soft skills or power skills but
what I really perceived is that the real
issue the real thing that people did not
like to talk too much about but that
really hurt them is the lack of
recognition now if you want to address
the lack of recognition and when we talk
about lack of recognition what is that
it's the general public like your
friends your family your
mother-in-law it's your bosses right the
CEOs the people who can make or break
your
career those people they're not
necessarily interested in what we call
too much project management success in
this profession they're interested in
project
success so the more we increase the gap
between project success and what we call
project management success the more we
have this recognition problem and even
when we talk about the triple
constraints know Cost U schedule
scope we have to realize even if we
deliver on the three of them it's very
possible that the project would be seen
by others as a failure you know because
you built the building that was planned
to build but in fact it's horrible it's
not useful it's not serving its purpose
or the app it's not working the product
is a
failure you want to associate yourself
with project success not just project
management success and that shift is
difficult to make because it will be not
just about being technically Savvy
knowledgeable but also really understand
on one side what is the real need you
know what is the real purpose of what
we're doing we call this benefit
realization outcomes you know we have
very technical words to talk about that
but let's go back to the business need
you know and that because that's what's
in the mind of your CEO let's talk about
the need for the stakeholders the
consumer the people who are going to use
whatever you create for your project
because that's what will give the
recognition as well now that's one thing
you need to ship that the second is you
cannot act as a victim and say I cannot
do anything about that because I'm just
a project
manager and I cannot influence that well
sometimes people ask me what is the
advice you would give to someone who
wants to become a CEO one day and I
always tell them start behaving today as
if the entire company relied on you of
course it's not exactly the case but
trust me if you behave that way if you
think that way one day there's a good
chance it will and it's the same for
project professionals think as if when
you see something that is not going to
work you have to own it try try hard try
to influence that try to influence
project success and then you will get
the recognition you
deserve so P are a really great point so
I think I agree like and and frankly
it's also a fresh perspective that you
need to differentiate between project
success and a project management success
so great Takeaway on that particular
point so again a related point that I
see lot of project managers struggle is
that they say that okay they're always
busy they are always juggling on
priorities and especially in the current
time where everybody every company is
trying to become more efficient so they
are cutting on the resources but they
want to achieve more outcome so in that
scenario how do they find time to skill
themselves like do you really see this
project management co-pilot coming and
helping them out how what would your
advice on how much time they spend on
actually their own professional
upliftment because lot of innovation is
happening in project management as a
professional also versus working on the
project how do you see this playing out
so if you have an asset let's say a
house your car a happy marriage are you
going to spend zero of your time working
on maintaining it just because you don't
have the time or do you understand that
you need to do it anyway right so start
thinking as your biggest asset is
yourself and so you have to maintain
yourself your asset your knowledge your
competencies again it's not a matter of
time it's a matter of survival like
you're not going to be relevant if you
don't upgrade yourself if you don't keep
yourself informed if you don't learn if
you don't connect with others so this is
first before you do anything else this
has to happen right and then the rest is
coming don't find excuses not to do
things I got to tell you sometimes I
feel tired I see that I'm supposed to go
to I don't know some cocktail party or
meet with people at 700 p.m. and it's
5:30 and I've been in meetings all day
and I'm really exhausted and I'm coming
back from whatever place in the world
and I'm jetl and I just you know want to
stay home I always think about the last
time that this happened and then I still
went out and then I didn't regret and I
I'm forcing myself and I go out and I do
meet with people and then when I'm when
I'm there I forget about the you know
the tiredness I forget about the
weariness and I never regret because I
learned something because I met people
because it refreshed my thinking you
know so do prioritize that and I do
understand sometimes you have your
family obligation it's not easy so I I'm
not making a general rule of my own life
right but spend time developing yourself
like it's absolutely non-negotiable it's
whatever time you spend on other things
you know make the room by the way
speaking of which trust me I do have a
lot of things to do in my day but I have
the same number of hours as everybody
else maybe I work a little more than the
average that's possible but even though
I would not have enough with 24 hours a
day and seven days a week to do
everything that people ask me to do I
use the Ison hour Matrix in my mind I
don't actually draw it on the board
right but I have it in my mind you know
this 2 by two Matrix the what is urgent
what is important right so let's say in
a very schematic way you divide
everything in four buckets urgent not
urgent important not that important most
people focus on what is urgent and not
important because they want to get it
out of the way right an easy way so
let's do all the emails first the
problem is you do this at the end of the
day you have done all these things but
you have done nothing important right
because important is usually more
difficult as well I really force myself
to start with what is important yes I
prioritize what is urgent over non-
urgent but I always start to determine
whether it's really important or not and
if it's not important and it will come
later and usually in my lifetime I would
say I spend 90% I try to spend 90% of my
time on important things the non
important things someone else will do it
it will be resolved by itself I don't
know like someone will deal with it I
try not to deal with this and I
understand it's a little selfish I do I
do understand that you know I do
understand it's selfish but it is vital
as well because this is the only way you
can really focus on the most important
things including your own personal
development and I cannot say enough how
critical it is especially in this world
that is changing very fast to upgrade
your knowledge your competencies develop
your network expand your thinking um
that's how you would be successful so I
think are all all great points and I can
relate to this fact that in fact this is
something that I wanted to ask you
earlier but maybe I I missed it is about
your own schedule like how do you manage
I see that you are all over the world
and you're always energized and always
fresh
like frankly I'm like I I have tried
doing it couple of times and then I feel
very exhausted and lethargic and then
conclude that this is not for me so what
what is the secret source of being
present everywhere and always being
fresh I'm not always fresh
inside uh you know yeah people believe I
love doing that and you know my wife
believes I love that my friends believe
that and it's true and it's not true at
the same time you know I'm not good with
jetl for instance I I can't sleep you
know because of jet lag I'm always
rushed also like always late I'm not
going to catch that flight and it's like
a little stressful like those little
things but and I hate packing this is
the worst thing ever packing uh and then
packing and thinking about what I'm
going to wear and try to minimize how
much I pack because otherwise I got too
much you know anyway so I hate the same
as everybody else you know but yes I
love meeting with people you know being
confronted to different cultures being
constantly challenged learning having
all my days a little different so what
are my tricks you know I try to control
how often I eat you know I was raised by
a French mother so she was very uh
intentional about not eating between
meals right so when you have a weird day
of 36 hours or 12 hours you know how
many many time you eat you know you got
to figure out but I try to control how
often I eat I eat a lot when I eat but I
try not to eat all the time right so I
have like I'm pretty disciplined about
that I don't know if it plays or not but
I try um mostly and it's probably a very
bad advice but I ignore when I'm I feel
tired and I just keep going like I
explained before you know it's like
sports you know sometimes you feel tired
but if you're a high really intense
competitor you just keep going right and
at one point the tiredness will go away
you know it's temporary and at one point
you will need to of course um uh stop
and and recharge you know which I I just
did I went on vacation I recharg in
Spain and I feel actually full of energy
right now you know I'm lucky in a way
also I'm in good health that's really
luck it's I have no merit for that and
it can last for a while and then not be
the case in the future anymore so you
know I I can function for a long time
without sleeping much I I I also try to
give people what they deserve right so
if I'm in a place and I meet with people
which happens to me all the time even if
I'm tired for them you know they meet
with me they expect me to to be um a fun
person to deal with right so I I do my
best I I I owe it to others right it's
not just I me if I'm tired then doesn't
matter what the others would feel you
know I try to give them the best I can
the best of myself it's not always easy
and I'm not always perfect but I'm doing
my best right and you know I Al also
think from a philosophical standpoint
I'm very privileged I was born um in a
good place in a country with no Wars
could have been different in Vietnam in
France at other periods or in other
places in the world I was in a
reasonably wealthy family not very
wealthy but upper middle class I got
good education good health so I was so
lucky I tried to be happy person you
know and because why should I not be
happy with all the luck I had and trying
to be happy helps no I think that's a
great point I think many time I see that
people who have who are like have all
the things in the world good health good
family good career but still they find
reason to be unhappy because something
else is missing on so it's really a
great great point it's easier said and
done I can relate to it and I have lot
of people in my ecosystem who I see this
happening all the time that they always
like craving for something that you
don't have and for sure even if you win
the entire world there will be something
left out for sure right so we all know
that but difficult to like follow in our
conscious mind right it's also very
lucky to have a mind frame where you
accept where you can do a a rational
thinking and and accordingly respond now
here I want to move move on to a to a
point that I see you talking about a lot
is AI I would not have imagined PMI
talking about AI frankly a few years
back but I I see that when it comes to
AI you have like a lot of viewpoints on
AI you are launching AI related products
for for the project management community
and how do you see like how do you see
AI becoming a integral part of project
management profession what part of a
typical project manager job do you think
AI can help them become more efficient
at what can I say about AI I think we're
going to reach a point where you know in
this adoption curve that uh that is very
famous from I think I don't know if it's
Forester or gner you know like this
curve um with reach this we probably
already passed the peak and we would be
in a phase of a disenchantment a little
bit and people would wonder how to use
it effectively and all of that you know
initially especially when um chat GPT
was made was released that a lot of
anxiety surfaced across all professions
but in particular in the project
management profession um you know all
studies all like five years ago saying
that 80% of the tasks of a project
manager will be automated
um created a lot of anxiety frankly uh
in the profession or either anxiety or
sort of a um different kind of
protection reaction right let's not even
talk about it or asking even PMI I heard
that the other day asking PMI to fight
AI to make sure that we can protect our
jobs you know that that's not realistic
so I'm not going to try that because
it's a bad idea I think what we need to
think about is how
AI is a fantastic opportunity for us as
a profession you know we want
recognition good if we can help the
companies we work for transform their
business models their activities their
operations with AI will be very very
recognized trust me so any project
manager who can do that manage an AI
transformation is going to be a big
start so that in itself is a massive
opportunity you you know that in the
cicon valley there are terminating
people you mentioned that before you
know they are reducing costs right now
doing all of this but the software
Engineers who work on AI can make
salaries of above $1 million right so if
you're interested in money as you were
saying before that's the right place to
be if you want to be successful as a
product manager be someone who can
manage an AI transformation but to do
that you have to learn some about AI
know it's not it starts with even using
AI in your own job as a project manager
um I see also AI as a way for us to
precisely evolve and focus more on
project success and and reduce the gap
between what we call project management
success and project success as many
tasks get automated as we can use AI to
augment the value we bring um as we can
use AI also to communicate better and
and and you know for instance developing
a stakeholder manage stakeholder
communication plan is something that
we've been talking about for a long time
but with AI you can do this in a very
granular way you can upload to the to
your tool the past conversations with a
specific person and ask the tool to help
you communicate more effectively with
that person in personalizing the way you
address um things like status reports or
uh issues that are raised or you know
things like that so it's it's it can be
extremely powerful is I think it's it's
going to make the job of project
managers more rewarding and potentially
help us get the recognition that we need
you know remember accountants you know I
I remember in my first one of my first
jobs uh I was appointed a CFO of a
company I was a CFO myself for a few
years like maybe two or three years so
in two different companies the first one
I got there the second one actually I
got there the head of accounting was a
guy who was 60 and he had all these
sheets of paper everywhere you know and
making calculations by hand and I told
him look why don't you use something
called Excel and and I will give you a
computer I will give you a training I
will actually teach you how to do that
so you know I'm going to retire soon I
don't want to go there I actually
convinced him to do it and then he
realize actually it's not difficult and
it's great you know I'm getting so much
time making less mistakes accountant
still exist in spite of excel right so a
lot of things that he was doing eight
hours a day now can be done in eight
minutes a day still we have accountants
they just shifted what they work on they
support the business people they support
operations they do other things they
install sap they a lot of things right
same guys are doing more much more
exactly Traders you know we used to have
these people standing around a basket
and making weird signs and exchanging
like stocks and papers
documents this is all done by computers
now but you still have people doing
trading you know they're quantitative um
uh computer scientists they are data
scientist you know there are people who
develop the system that enables a fast
high volume Trading and sophisticated
strategies to make more money you know
that's what it is so for project
professionals the same thing will happen
if we don't let AI dominate us but if we
own it uh the AI transformation of
project management which BMI wants to
lead of course do you see certain
industries or certain countries they're
adopting AI faster than certain
industries and certain countries like
that something that we will be working
towards advocating them so for sure we
are in agreement that AI needs to be an
asset for project managers and those who
can make it as their as a kind of a
partner in whatever they do they are the
one who are going to be successful we
are doing some research around that now
so I I can't fully answer but I would
tell you that um of course the tech
industry is like it's easier to adopt AI
in many ways knowledge Industries easier
as well uh but I see in all Industries
and in all countries a lot of lot of
interest and a lot of Investments around
that so I don't think it's going to be
some countries more than others of
course with new technologies Emerging
Markets go faster in general you know
they skip a little bit the stages that
the others have had to go through to go
through so yes you know the US is the
number one company country in terms of
investments in AI developing the tools
but for us organizations making these
Transformations happen is sometimes more
difficult than in other markets where
things are more lean there is less
Legacy you know so I think for emerging
market and people who come from Emerging
Markets is actually a fantastic
opportunity somebody has asked um what
is the worst advice you have given
someone worst advice yeah you have given
to someone
[Laughter]
oh I don't know they would not tell
me maybe something that you thought that
okay it was an a advice right I don't
know okay I would have to think about
that and post it on LinkedIn
and the next question is that um what is
the meaning of your name so I think my
first name Pier is a is a a Catholic
name right it's the first U Apostle of
Jesus my my mom is Catholic I was raised
as a Catholic my last name sounds very
French but it's not it's Vietnamese so
Vietnamese names are usually in three
parts I kept two parts of my dad's name
um the first two Le man um Le is a
dynasty so in Vietnam many people have
the same name as a dynasty like M like
Le Chen whatever um and then mine is
just a second name like a you can ask
Vietnamese people what it actually means
they have different interpretation of it
so I'm not going to comment on it
there's also a very interesting question
somebody has asked thing that if you are
left with a smartphone and less than
$1,000 and you have to survive what will
you do what profession what what work
will you do to survive
um the first thing I would do is to try
and find a job good any job to be able
to survive the time I figure out what to
do
next a great point and then there's
another question from somebody in aeran
saying that it's an imagi market and
what is PMI doing to support project
managers in in such Market which might
not be on the main map for PMI but still
there are people like him or her working
or want to work in project management as
a profession what kind we do have
chapters in over 200 countries and aan
like any other country you know we we
have a few restrictions uh in countries
that
are uh blacklisted by the US government
it's a little complicated for us to
operate there but apart from that uh we
have no restrictions so aan of course
you know should be part of our
plans so great perer we talked about PMI
transformation we talked about your
hiring philosophy we talked about
project management profession we did
speak about atps and what they should
expect we also talked about AI because
no discussion is complete the these days
without AI now I want to move on to the
last section where we will do some rapid
fire questions I'm scared
already so what's the book that has had
significant impact on your
career it's a book by
um that is called uh First Break The
Rules uh it's it's a it's an interesting
book I read that when I was much younger
um it it it is the reason why I focus on
people's strength first and foremost It
Was Written like 35 years ago but it did
have a big impact on me great how do you
unwind after a busy
day um at 8:00 pm my wife when I'm when
I'm home right so it's not most of the
time if I'm home at 8:00 p.m. my wife
has a he half German so at 8:00 p.m.
promp we're having having dinner right
so I'm a very disciplined person at 8:00
p.m. I go have dinner and I try not to
work after that if it's possible usually
it's not but I try and then I'm going to
read a you know a book or watch a movie
and then go to sleep and then start the
next day if I'm not home my days finish
very late so I don't unwind I just
sleep so what what's one piece of advice
you'll give to your younger self don't
worry too much like uh go with the flow
take texting or talking
texting yeah nickname your parents used
to call you no
nickname name no if you could describe
PMI in one word what would that be
Community are so lovely talking to you I
had many other questions also as I said
my team had also put in some question
but I didn't get time to look into it so
let's do a second season next year if
that is not if this one is successful if
you got views and positive comments
we'll do it again
we'll do that thank you so much and have
a great day ahead thank you Krishna

hey everyone i am bravo khandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply launch youtube
channel
in this session we will learn to create
a basic calculator using c sharp
but before we begin make sure you
subscribe to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn's
youtube channel
so let's get started with the demo
we will be using a visual studio to
create it
at the end of this tutorial you can
expect a calculator to look like this
we will be programming these buttons to
give an arithmetic capabilities to this
calculator
now let's get started with the
calculator let's move on to our visual
studio
we will start by creating a new project
while creating a project we will select
windows app form and then we will get
this window
let's change the windows label from form
1 to calculator
now we will start with adding some
labels to understand the gui
so we will start by getting a toolbox
you can get that from going to view
and selecting toolbox
here on search toolbox write label
we will use these labels
let's change the text
to calculator
and let's give it some color
highlight
and some font
like mono type cursor italic bold
and of size 20.
now
we will start by adding some more labels
the toolbox
label
label
will show
the value one
we will increase its size to 12 and bold
we will make similar labels
by simply copy pasting
we will get three of these labels
we we'll change the second label
to
value 2
and the third label as output
now increase
this size
now
we will add some text box
this text box will be used to get inputs
for value one
let's increase its one size
from 8
to 12.
let's give it bold
okay
now we will copy paste the same text box
for value 2
and we will add another text box for
output to get the output for this value
now let's add some buttons to showcase
the arithmetic capabilities
so button
we will have its size at 12
to show it better
and we will change the label
from button 1 two plus
let's resize this stack button
let's give it bold as well
now we will replace this button to get
different buttons
one for the subtraction
one for multiplication
one for
division and one for percentage
let's change the name labels as well
minus
division
multiplication
and percentage
now let's start with some coding
we will first code for the button
plus
we will start with
getting some text from the value 1 and
value 2.
so
double
val 1
is equals to
convert
dot 2 double
text box 1
dot
text
here we are taking them as double to get
them the flexibility of decimal numbers
we will do that for the same for the
value 2 as well so double
val 2
is equals to
convert textbook to text
now
double
and we will have sum
equals to
as val one
plus
val2
since these text box only recognize the
string values so we will have to convert
this sum from double to string
so
text box 3
dot text
is equals to
sum
dot
tostring
open parenthesis
now let's code for the negative one
we can just simply copy paste the above
code
because it will be
almost similar
we will do some tweaks
for the difference
so
if
here we will get minus
and here it will change to f again
let's do the same for the multiplication
division and percentage
sort of division
ctrl v
let's give it
division
let's do that for multiplication
product
your product
and at last
for percentage
it will be percent
here we will group them
division
and bracket
and then multiply it with 100
to get the
percentage we will change the step to
percent
now let's compile
and see if this code works
this will take some time
and here is our calculator
let's give it some values to check if it
works fairly
let's take 5
and 10.
let's do addition
yes it is giving us 15 let's do a
subtraction yes 5 minus 10 is minus 5
a division it is 0.5 a multiplication is
50. a percentage it is also 50 so let's
take some other example let's change the
value to 200
and see
yes it is giving us five percent
now let's get back to our slides

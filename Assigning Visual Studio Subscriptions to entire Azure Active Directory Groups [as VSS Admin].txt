- [Narrator] Assigning
subscriptions to groups
using Microsoft Entra ID.
(upbeat music)
Assigning subscriptions to
entire Microsoft Entra groups
can really simplify the
management of your subscriptions.
To add a Microsoft
Entra group, select Add.
Then in the dropdown, select
Microsoft Entra group.
In the flyout panel,
search your organization's Entra tenant
for the group you'd like to add.
Select or hover over the View Members link
to see all members in the group.
Remember to add or change
any members of the group.
A Microsoft Entra admin
needs to edit the group
in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
After selecting the group
you'd like to assign subscriptions to,
make your selections for
the remaining options,
then select Add,
and you'll see the Microsoft Entra group
listed in the Name column of
your subscription assignments.
The assignment options you selected
will apply to all members of
the Microsoft Entra group,
simplifying administrative work for you
and any other admin supporting
these subscriptions.
As users are added to the group
through the Microsoft Entra admin center,
they will automatically be assigned
the Visual Studio subscription indicated.
When users are removed from
the Microsoft Entra group,
their subscription assignments
will be removed as well,
all without any action needed
in the Visual Studio
subscriptions admin portal.
If a user already has an
individual subscription assigned
and is later assigned the
same subscription level
through Microsoft Entra group assignment,
that user will still only
have one subscription
and will be organized within
the Microsoft Entra group
rather than being listed individually
in the main subscription assignments list.
If an individual user has
a subscription at one level
and is later assigned another subscription
at a different subscription level
as part of a Microsoft
Entra group assignment,
that user will be shown
in the list of assigned
subscriptions as both an individual
and as a member within
a Microsoft Entra group
and will have two subscriptions
assigned, one at each level.

hey everyone i am pepper khandelwal and
i welcome you all to our simply learned
youtube channel today we will talk about
one of the interesting topics that are
operators and expressions in c sharp
but before we begin let me tell you guys
we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for a latest
technological advancement then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon below so you never miss an update
on simply launch youtube channel
now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with
what are operators
then we will learn about what an
expression is
now we will dive into the types of
operators
then we will discuss the precedence and
operators
finally we will wind up this session
within implementation in a code editor
let's get started with what a operator
is
operators are symbols that can be used
to perform operations on operands
and a brand can be a variable or a
constant
operators are used to manipulate
variables and values in c sharp
c sharp has several operators that are
classified based on the operations they
perform
now let's discuss expressions
an expression in c sharp is made up of
operands that are variables literals
methods calls and operators
an expression must have at least one
operand but can have zero or more
operators
an expression statement is an expression
followed by a semicolon
now let's have a look at the types of
operators
there are five types of operators
in c sharp
first assignment operator then
arithmetic operator
relational operators
logical operators and urinary operators
now let's discuss them in detail
first up assignment operator
when assigning values to variables the
assignment operator that is equal
is used
and use the syntax for that
next arithmetic operator
arithmetic operators are used to carry
out the arithmetic operations like
addition subtraction multiplication and
division
and here's the syntax for that
next relational operators when comparing
two operands the relational operators
are used
if the relationship is true then the
result will be true otherwise it will be
false
and here is the syntax for that
then logical operators
to perform logical operations logical
operators such as and and or are used
based on boolean expression
the logical operator returns boolean
values true and false
logical operators are used in decision
making and loops
and here's the syntax for that
at last urinary operator
the urinary operator unlike other
operators have only one operand and
here's the syntax for that
now let's discuss the operator
precedence
in an expression
with multiple operators the operators
with the highest precedence are
evaluated first
when an operand is between operators of
the same precedence then the order of
operation is determined
by associativity with the operator
now let's try these operations in a code
editor
let's start by creating some variables
in
x
comma y
let's try the assignment operators first
so we can
assign an operator by using equal sign
so we will assign the 10 value to x
let's try
to print it
x equals to
then we will do plus
x
simultaneously we can also assign the
value of x to y by the same method
let's try to print y as well so console
dot write line
y is equals to
plus
y
let's run this
first save
then execute
as you can see it's getting x is equal
to 10 and when we define y is equals to
x then it is showing y is equals to 10.
now let's try to do arithmetic
operations
for that we will need another variable
called res
we will delete these operations
or rather
we will comment them out
and we will give
y equals to
5
let's try the addition operator
so res will be equals to
x
plus
y
we will now try to print it
console dot right
line
so x
x plus
y
here plus
undress
let's do the same thing
let's delete this command to make the
make it easy
let's copy
the last two statement
and paste it
now we will change plus to minus
and multiplication
and division
now let's try to print it
first save it
and then we will print it
here as you can see the x is equal to 10
and y is equal to 5 so x plus 5 it is
printing 15
and x minus y is representing 5
then x multiplied by 5 that is 5
multiplied by 10 is 50
and then x divided by y that is 10
divided by 5 is 2.
now
let's try relational operators
so first
we will define a boolean variable
that will be value 1.
now we will store
the value
1
is equals to
embraces
x
double equals to
y
now this text if the x is equals to y
since x and y are two different numbers
that is 10 and 5 so it will show us
false
so to print that
console
dot write line
x
greater than
x equals to
y
will return
plus
value
1
let's try this same operation
for the cases of
greater than
and less than
let's save this
and
run it
as you can see the x is equal to equals
to 5 is returning false because 10 is
not equal to 5
for the x greater than y
that is 10 is greater than 5 so it
returns true
and
vice versa it will return false for the
lesser terms
now
let's comment these out as well
now let's try logical operators
so we'll again define the x equals to
30
and
y is equals to
10.
first we will try the or operator
let's clip this out
paste it here so that we can use this
value and operation again
so for the or operator we will use value
1
is equals to
f x is equal to equals to y
and the or or is a vertical dash
or x is greater than
5
so in case of x either one of the
condition must be true then it will
return true so since x is equal to
equals to y is false which we have
already done that here
so
now the x if x is greater than 5 then it
will also return true
so
to check that we will print
console dot
write line
value
one
let's do it for the end operator as well
so
the value
let's copy paste it
this time we will remove these vertical
dashes
to
and and operator
let's save it and run it
as you can see in the first case we are
using an or operator
in which either one of them is required
to be true to get a true answer since x
is greater than 5 is a true answer so it
is giving us a true answer
but in case of the end operator
both of them needs to be true for it to
give true since x equals to equals to y
was false which we have checked in our
relational operation experiment so now
this will give us the false answer
now
let's try
and do urinary operators
let's take a different variable so end
z
equals to 10
comma
a value 2
and a boolean
that is flag
which is equals to
true
now first try
so value
2 is equals to
plus 3
now we will print these
start
right line
plus z
is equals to
comma
plus
value
two
let's copy paste them
and change
these values
now we will use minus z
here also
minus send
another operation where we will use
double plus
now we will use minus
and for the last one
we will use
console
dot
writeline
and we will print
the negation of flag
since flag is defined as true so this
one should show
flag as false
let's run this
as you can see it is showing the plus
that equals to ten and minus that is
equals to negative ten
the plus two z increment the value by
one
then minus minus z decrement the value
by 1 so since plus plus z was already 11
so minus minus z just decreased it to
10.
now the flag is showing true because i
haven't used the negation symbol here so
now let's add the negation symbol and
save it and then run it back
here now it's showing the false
now let's get back to our slide

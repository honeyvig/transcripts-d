finding the features you need and the
code you're looking for has never been
easier than with the new all-in-one
search experience in Visual Studio let's
take a look we'll start by enabling the
feature go to tools options
search for the keyword
search and select preview features
now check the checkbox next to New
Visual Studio search experience and
restart Visual Studio you now have the
new all-in-one search experience from
here you can select code search or
feature search
code search lets you search through all
of your files class names method names
and so on and it's super fast just hit
enter to open the file
code search shows you a preview to the
right side of the search results but you
can move that underneath if you prefer
that or disable it completely
from the preview you can do code
navigation such as go to definition
or refactoring such as rename of
variables this way I don't even have to
open the specific file in order to do my
refactorings throughout the entire
solution making this a lot more
efficient feature search or control Q
allows me to search for features
throughout the visual studio IDE for
instance the text Explorer tool window I
can also search for individual options
in the tools options dialog directly
from the feature search
here I'm searching for a way to change
the keyboard shortcuts and it takes me
right to the place I want to be if you

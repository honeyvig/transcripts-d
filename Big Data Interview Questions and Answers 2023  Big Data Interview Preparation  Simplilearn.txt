end of this video and don't forget to
register your opinion in the comment
section below and now starting with the
interview questions so first question is
Define big data and explain the ways of
big data so big data can be described as
a compilation of intricate unstructured
or semi-structured data sets that
processes the potential to yield
actionable insights and the four
fundamental Dimensions often referred as
the v's of Big Data are as follows the
first is volume this aspect pertains to
the shear magnitude of data generated
and collected it signifies the immense
quantity of data that conventional data
processing techniques might struggle to
handle the next is variety this Factor
emphasizes the diverse range of formats
and types in which data is presented Big
Data encompasses structured unstructured
and semi-structured data from various
sources and the next is velocity
referring to the speed at which data is
generated and must be processed the
velocity Dimension underscores the need
for real time or near real-time data
analysis due to the rapid influx of data
veracity veracity highlights the
reliability and trustworthiness of the
available table data inaccurate
inconsistent or uncertain data can
adversely impact the quality of insights
derived from Big Data analysis so this
was about big data and the views of big
data now moving on to the next question
that is what do you mean by commodity
Hardware so the term commodity Hardware
alludes to the minimal Hardware
Essentials necessary for operating the
Apache Hadoop framework any hardware
configuration that satisfies the minimum
prerequisites of Hadoop is categorized
as commodity Hardware so this was all
about commodity Hardware so moving on to
the next question that is Define and
describe the term FS CK so fsck and
acronym for file system check denotes a
command employee to initiate a summary
assessment of hadoops hdfs condition it
solely identifies errors and does not
undertake corrective actions fsck can be
executed on the complete system or
subset of files and this was all about
fsck now moving on to the next question
that is what is the purpose of the JPS
command in Hadoop the JPS Java process
status command is utilized to ascertain
the functionality of various Hadoop
demons it primarily validates the
operational status of daily modes such
as name mode data node resource manager
and node manager and now move on to the
next question that is how is Hadoop
related to Big Data so when delving into
the realm of Big Data Hadoop emerges as
a pivotal framework Hadoop an open
source platform is tailored for the
storage processing and Analysis of
intricate unstructured data sets to
glean valuable insights and intelligent
this is how Hadoop is related to Big
Data and moving on to the next question
that is sixth question Define htfs and
yarn and talk about their respective
components so Hadoop distributive file
system hdfs is the core storage
mechanism within the Hadoop ecosystem it
is responsible for housing diverse data
types in a distributed environment hdfs
comprises two integral components the
first is name node and this Center node
preserves metadata concerning all data
blocks within hdfs and the second is
data node these nodes serve as leaves
tasked with storing the actual data
blocks and now talking about yarn that
is yet another resource negotiator yarn
serves as the resource manager for
managing resources and establishing an
execution environment for processors and
yarn also features two key components
the first is resource manager it
allocates resources to corresponding
node managers according to requirements
and the second is node manager this
component oversees task execution on
each data node and now moving on to the
next question that is explain the
different features of Hadoop so Hadoop
possesses several distinctive features
that make it a permanent choice for
handling Big Data challenges one of its
most significant features is being open
source which means its code can be
freely modified and adapted to fulfill
varying user and analytical needs
another vital feature is incorporate new
hardware resources into its cluster by
adding new nodes furthermore Hadoop
employs data replication to ensure data
recovery in the event of failures
enhancing data reliability additionally
the concept of data locality in Hadoop
is crucial as it prioritizes moving
computation processes to the data itself
resulting in improved processing
efficiency and now we will move to the
next question that is Define the port
numbers for name node task tracker and
job tracker so the port numbers for the
essential components in Hadoop cluster
are as follows so the port number for
name node is
50070 and for the task tracker it's
50060 and for the job tracker it's 50030
and moving on to the next question that
is what do you mean by indexing in hdfs
in hdfs that is Hadoop distributed file
system indexing refers to the
organization of data blocks based on
their sizes each data block contains a
pointer to the location of the
subsequent block which contributes to
the sequential data storage the data
nodes within the Hadoop cluster manage
these data blocks while the name node
keeps track of their Arrangement and
distribution
and now we will move to the next
question that is what are H nodes in
Hadoop so Edge nodes play a pivotal role
in Hadoop environments acting as
intermediaries connecting the Hadoop
cluster with external networks these
nodes serve as platforms for running
client applications and cluster
management tools they also serve as
staging areas for data processing tasks
typically a single edge node can support
multiple Hadoop clusters due to their
multifaceted role as nodes require
Enterprise level storage capabilities
and the next question is what are some
of the data management tools used with
Edge nodes in Hadoop so when it comes to
Edge nodes in Hadoop several data
management tools and Frameworks come
into play notable among them are Uzi
ambari Pig flow so these tools are
commonly utilized in conjunction with
Edge nodes to enhance data management
capabilities within Hadoop clusters so
these were the data management tools
that we use with h nodes in Hadoop now
move on to the next question that is
explain the core methods of a reducer so
reducer are funded mental components in
hadoops map reduce programming Paradigm
they perform data aggregation and
consolidation task reduces Encompass
Three core methods the first is setup
and the third is cleanup after the
reduction process is complete the
cleanup method is invoked it is
responsible for clearing temporary files
and performing any necessary cleanup
operations at the end of a reducer task
certainly here is the information
provided in your request and now we'll
move to the next question that is talk
about the different Tombstone markers
used for deletion purposes in edgepace
in the realm of hbase a prominent tear
in the Big Data landscape Tombstone
markers play a crucial role in
facilating data deletion there are three
distinct types of Tombstone markers each
serving a specific purpose the first is
family delete marker this marker is
employed to signify the removal of an
entire column family along with its
Associated columns by utilizing the
family delete marker all the columns
within the concerned family are
effectively marked for deletion and the
next is version delete marker when a
particular version of a single column
needs to be expunged the version delete
marker comes into play this marker
allows for the selective removal of a
specific version of a single column
ensuring precise data management and
next we have is column delete marker in
scenarios where all versions of a single
column are to be wiped out the column
delete marker comes to the Forefront by
employing this marker all versions of
the designated column are appropriately
marked for deletion so these were the
tombstone markers that are used for
deletion purposes and base and now
moving on to the 14th question that is
deploying a big data solution so how do
you deploy a big data solution so
embarking on the journey to deploy a
comprehensive Big Data solution involves
a strategic three-step process the first
step is data ingestion commencing the
deployment the initial step in involves
the acquisition of data from diverse
sources encompassing social media
platforms log files and relevant
business documents this data is
collected either through real-time
streaming mechanisms or batch processing
the next step is data storage once the
data is procured the subsequent task is
storing it within a suitable database
the choice often rest between the Hadoop
distributed file system hdfs and hbase
hdfs excels in sequential access
scenarios while hbase is optimized for
random read and write operations and the
next step we have is data processing the
final phase of the deployment centers
around data processing Frameworks such
as Hadoop spark mapreduce clink and pick
step in to perform the intricate task of
processing the Amaze data these
Frameworks are instrumental in deriving
valuable insights from the raw data so
this is how you deploy a big data
solution moving on to the next question
that is distinguishing NFS nhdfs that is
how is NFS different from hdfs so the
first moment is for NFS it can both
store and process more volumes of data
whereas in hdfs it is explicitly
designed to store and process big data
and in NFS the data is stored in
dedicated Hardware whereas an hdfs data
is divided into Data blocks that are
distributed on the local drives of the
hardware and in NFS in the case of
system failure you cannot access the
data and in hdfs data can be accessed
even in the case of a system failure and
in NFS NFS students own a single machine
there's no chance for data redundancy
and in hdfs it runs on a cluster of
machines and hence the replication
protocol may lead to redundant data and
the next question is list the different
file permissions in hdfs for files or
directory levels so in the Hadoop
distributed file system that is hdfs
distinct permissions are assigned to
files and directories catering to
different users level owner group and
others each user level boast three
distinct permissions for files the r
permission enables reading of files
content the W permission empowers
writing data into a file the x that is
execute permission while present does
not Grant execution rights for hdfs
files and if we talk about directories
the r permission facilitates listing the
contents of a specific directory and the
W permission allows the creation or
deletion of a directory and the x that
is execute permission is associated with
assessing child directories within the
Parent Directory this array of
permission forced us a granular and
secure approach to managing files and
directories within the hdfs ecosystem
and now moving on to the next question
that is enumerate the three modes
available for running Hadoop in the
realm of Big Data interviews a
frequently encountered query revolves
around the three operational modes of
Ado that is first is Standalone mode
second is pseudo distributed mode and
the third is fully distributed mode so
Standalone mode this serves as hadoop's
default setting utilizing the local file
system for both input and output
operations primarily geared towards
debugging Standalone mode lack support
for hdfs that is Hadoop distributed file
system and lacks the custom
configuration associated with and lacks
the custom configuration associated with
mapred site dot XML core site dot XML
and sdfs hyphen site.xml files and now
talking about sudo distributed mode this
is referred to as the single node
cluster pseudo distributed mode involves
housing both the name mode and data node
on the same machine this configuration
concentrates the old Hadoop demons onto
a single node effectively merging the
roles of Master and slave nodes and then
we have this fully distributed node
operating as a multi-node cluster this
node that is operating as a multi-node
cluster this mode leverages multiple
nodes simultaneously to execute Hadoop
task in the setup distinct nodes
accommodate various Hadoop demons
maintaining a clear democration between
master and slave nodes so this was about
the three modes available for running
Hadoop now moving on to the next
question that is the Define the concept
of overfitting so overfitting
characterizes a modeling error that
arises when a function is excessively
tailored to unlimited set of data points
this results in an intricate model that
struggles to account for Unique nuances
or peculiarities within the data sets
the repercussions of overfitting are
detrimental to the model's ability to
generalize rendering the predictive
capabilities of overfitted models in
dubious these models falter when applied
to external or novel data sets within
the realm of machine learning or fitting
ranks among the most prevalent
challenges a model falls into the
overfitting category when it excels on
the training data set but performs
decimally on the test data set numerous
strategies exist to avoid overfitting
including crossover addition pruning
early stopping regularization and
Ensemble techniques so this was all
about overfitting now moving on to the
next question that is elaborate on the
concept of outliers an outlier pertains
to a data point or observation that
deviates significantly from the norm
within a random sample but definitely
outliers are data values that diverge
markedly from the general cluster or
group in the data set these outliers
have the potential to influence the
behavior of models often misleading the
training process of machine learning
algorithms adverse effects of outliers
Encompass prolonged training duration in
precise models and subpar outcomes
however outliers May Harbor valuable
insights on occasion this underscores
the importance of meticulous
investigation and appropriate treatment
of outliers and now moving on to the
next question that is list several
methods for detecting outliers once
again a pivotal inquiry in Big Data
interviews here are six techniques for
identifying outliers first we'll discuss
the first three that is Extreme value
analysis probabilistic and statistical
models and linear models so the first is
Extreme value analysis so this method
delves into the statistical tales of the
data distribution utilizing statistical
techniques like Z scores on univariate
data exemplifies extreme value analysis
the next is probably stick and
statistical models this approach targets
instances deemed improbable within a
probabilistic model of the data a prime
instance involves optimizing gaussian
mixture models via the expectation
maximization process then we have linear
models this methodology involves mapping
the data into lower dimensions then we
have the fourth one that is
approximately base models then
information theoretic model and high
dimensional outlier detection this
technique discerns data instances
isolated from the broader data set group
through methods such as cluster density
or nearest neighbor analysis then we
have information theoretical models this
strategy identifies outliers as
instances that augment the complexity of
the data set ultimately impairing it
then we have high dimensional outlier
detection this method pinpoints outliers
subspaces by employing distance measures
in higher dimensions

step includes understanding and building
a strong base of it Concepts like how
networks work TCP IP OSI model different
operating systems like Windows and Linux
and how we manage data this starting
point will make it easier for you to
understand cloud computing moving on to
the second step which is learning cloud
Basics this includes learning about
cloud computing's main features its
different Services models they provide
like infrastructure as a service
platform as a service and software as a
service deployment models like public
private and hybrid which will help you
understand how cloud computing changes
the way business work get to know the
main Cloud platforms like AWS Azure and
Google Cloud understand word basic
Services they provide such as Computing
storage and networking these Basics are
very important for you to start your
journey to become a cloud engineer now
we will move on to the third step which
is gaining programming skills well to
become a cloud engineer we do not need
any coding background but having
considerable programming skills will
certainly help a lot learning any of
these programming languages like python
or Java will let us automate our task
and work with AWS improving our
abilities as a cloud engineer we have
now covered the basic fundamentals and
learned essential programming skills we
will now be looking ahead to the fourth
step which is diving into AWS Services
the first step includes learning about
AWS services and the tools that every
cloud enthusiast needs to know first of
all let's talk about compute services
like ec2 and Lambda that allow us to run
our applications and code effortlessly
installing Linux operating system
creating directories and installing
packages is a must AWS provides reliable
storage options such as S3 AWS and EFS
where we can securely store our data it
also uses other services for Network
working such as VPC and security groups
to connect and secure our resources
seamlessly also for managing our Cloud
environment with the use of tools like
Cloud watch and cloud trail help us
monitor track and automate Services
effortlessly finally using
containerization technology such as
Docker and tools for managing containers
like kubernets is very important after
learning all these Services we have
almost achieved 90% of our journey we
will now talk about the cloud security
Cloud security is very important using
identity and access management
encryption and access control make sure
that our data stays safe after ensuring
Cloud security we have understood AWS
Services we will now move on to the next
step which is using devops with AWS so
in this step we will learn about using
devops principle to automate setting up
infrastructure and deploying
applications by using tools like
terraform and cloud formation these tool
help us to make our configuration much
more easier well after learning all
these topics you are all set to go but
wait do you know having considerable
knowledge without certification is not
sufficient for you to become a cloud
engineer let us see how AWS Cloud
certifications are very important and
the question is why should you get one

certifications are very important as
they validate our skills open doors to
New Opportunities and also show
dedication to growth we now know the
importance of certification so in the
next step we will talk about some real
world projects in cloud computing one
way to gain practical experience is by
working on personal or open-source
projects we can create and set up a
virtual machine use different tools like
terraform and deploy them in our web app
also we can create cloud storage
solutions these project will allow us to
apply whatever we have learned in the
real world another approach is to
implement Solutions in a cloud
environment to solve real world problems
by working on the actual challenges
faced by businesses or organizations we
will get hands-on experience and learn
how to effectively deploy Cloud
Technologies to address these issues
till now we have covered all the
essential steps we have almost completed
our journey well we are all set to apply
for jobs but before that remember
networking with professionals via
LinkedIn freelance gigs building

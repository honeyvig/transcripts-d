brief about this website that we are
going to create
so this is a navbar that I'm gonna show
you how to create
and this is a responsive website guys
so this is the image part that I am
going to add
the best coding bootcamp the next is
award winning bootcamp data science full
stack and many more
and simply learn technology web
development data science
in this page I am also adding let me
just show you these cards okay and this
one button to go to the top

things and one partition over it so
whenever I overlook anything it will
click
but let me go to the home page again and
let me show you whenever I click on the
homepage topics it will show me data
science and full stack whenever I click
on the full stack it will come to the
simply learn full stack web development
course so this is a postgraduate program
in full stack web development by Caltech
this has ranked number one best coding
boot camper career Karma
you can check out this program the link
will be in the description box
now let's open the visual studio code
and let's make it full screen yeah so
but before we jump to the coding part
let me just tell you what bootstrap is
so bootstrap is a popular front-end
development framework that helps
developer quickly build responsive and
mobile first drive applications
it provides a set of HTML CSS and
JavaScript components as well as a grid
system and various utility classes to
make web development faster and easier
you can go to the bootstrap page
just type bootstrap
and it will open the
get bootstrap
so in this page you can learn all about
bootstrap
everything you need to know about
bootstrap is in here only
so just open the bootstrap docs inside
the docs you'll find everything how to
download bootstrap
contents JavaScript
customization SAS color how the color
model Works components everything
just let's let's go to the components
part inside the components box uh we are
going to discuss uh how the alert bads
breadcrumb buttons cards everything
works so don't worry about anything so
this bootstrap tutorial will help you
how to create a website from scratch to
a full-fledged website and we'll discuss
all the components that any fresher
needs to know okay so let's open our
Visual Studio code
let's go back first and create a project
here inside my
desktop I'm gonna give it as bootstrap
website
okay
and open this bootstrap and left click
okay
now let's open this folder on our Visual
Studio code by just pressing this open
folder and inside the desktop
we have bootstrap obtaining okay
now
the first thing we are going to do is we
are going to create one file let's name
is index dot HTML
we'll write all the code inside this
file only
but for the website main website will
create two other pages okay let's begin
now let's open the bootstrap website and
inside there you'll see a starter
template
copy this and paste it inside your
windows Studio code
let's do some editing this title will
show you
What's the title of the page I'm gonna
show you in a while just wait here I'm
gonna write
thank you
and here I'm gonna write
let's save this and here
not ER that's right e n for English
it's not okay
okay all right
so directory we don't need right now
let's remove this one and
returning viewport it's fine and
everything looks fine here
we can also
copper and bootstrap libraries
let's save it and one more thing open
the extension and add
live server
this live server can open our website
and whenever I just make any change on
the website we don't have to again
reload the web page and check if it's
working or not it will just do
everything on its own
so I have installed this
okay let me go back to my HTML file
and right click and there you will see
there's one uh open with like so
and this will open our page
see
so it is showing hello from Simply so
you must all be thinking that how is it
possible with just
these few lines I am writing the code
hello
from Simply learn on our web page
so these are the things let me just show
you what really bootstrap is
when I'll click on The View page source
so this is the page okay so this is
bootstrap CSS you will see this link and
this is the original bootstrap that the
developer has invented for us users so
with this small link
we can use the bootstrap on our web
pages
so this is really very helpful for the
developers and you can create an amazing
website using just bootstrap
okay let's just move forward and let me
just close these and let's go to the
navbar
okay this is the Never
so
never is something which comes on the
top like this one this simply learn all
courses the search box and login page
this is what a nav bar is so we are
going to copy one
navbar template from here
whichever looks good for you guys
I'm just searching for that
okay let's go up
and see and see if there is any simple
over this one also
good so you can find this copy to
clipboard option
everywhere you can also manually copy
this thing whenever you just want so if
sometimes I want just this navbar home
link and drop down menu so what I'll do
I'll just copy this from here
to here
rather copying the all
code
so let's copy it and
paste it
after
this hello
let's delete this hello and paste it
let's save it
and see our navbar
so this is our nearby home link
drop down menu we have to add the
features here in the drop down we will
do that no worries
start report
okay
now let's get to know
about this neighbor
so
as you can see the home button is a
little darker than this link drop down
and disabled one right
so this is because of this active
so what this active dial this actor
makes the button highlighted that this
page is it is showing that this is this
home page is this page okay so if I'll
remove the active from here
and I'll put the active in the link part
so what we'll do
is
okay
let me just restart my server
open the live server again
and let's
see
the link is now highlighted okay
let's go back to code and do some
changes inside this code right
and as you see
this one is a drop down
but this is not working let's fix this
one
and as you can see this starts from head
to here
okay
now let's see the properties of this
drop down and
make this a function but before that let
me just show you how to format the
document if I click format the document
it will format as in a clean way so any
other user will see a code it'll get to
know that this is how he has written so
it will show where the bar is started
and where it got ended and if you'll see
this div from where to where it'll show
okay from this form it starts from here
to it so it just helps us to read the
code efficiently by just clicking right
click and format document you have to do
this again and again
whenever you add or write something in
your code you just have to do it again
and again okay
okay fine let's fix this nav bar now
not never this
drop down
okay let's see
okay
this has a linked class or drop down and
it has the link of toggle
then it doesn't have the location where
to add this things are giving it a role
but
I think we should give it a ID also
so so what is an ID ID is something
which is specific to someone
okay let me give you an example for that
uh okay uh your suppose your name is
something your name is uh David so your
name is David everybody know your name
is David so you are in office or in
college or in school in your class there
must be a chance that there are some
other David also inside your class
so what roll number registration number
or any specific number you needs is that
it gives you an identity that this is
your specific number that number can't
be given to altern David
are you understanding so that number is
specifically given to you
so this is how ID works it is given to a
specific thing like here if I'm using
the ID as something like you can just
say
ideas
okay let's just save this
so this ID is given to this class only
okay so the class what is what about
class class is given to so many other
people also class is a group so you can
give this class to someone else also but
you can't give this ID to someone else
because it's specific to this function
only so this is how this works okay well
let's just see if there is something
else that we can add or remove
now this drop down menu is not working
but whenever I hover on there is this
something is happening so what I will do
is I'll inspect this page and I'll
click on this and I'll click on this
drop down and see what is the issue
I know but
to continue that
button
there can set this there
so this is how the this nav bar is
operating
this is taking some chunks of the screen
and creating components so the nav bar
is
looking like this right
okay
just let me go to my
drop down
this one is the drop down
in the whether I'll see
okay when you right click after
it's not operating right
on menu
okay let's see
here
right there
okay this drop down is working fine now
because I comment out the separate
proper and bootstrap.js
so when I was
giving it access to my file
this drop down was not working so like
I'm clicking on this but it's not
working
so because of this pooper
and I'm whenever I'm
now it'll be fucking fine right okay
let's move on to the
editing of this
let's name this as
first I'll use bold
and I'm gonna name my dad
sent it on
okay let's save it and then we'll gonna
name this as home only
let's name it as about
about
and then drop down is
courses
okay and inside this courses I'm gonna
write
will
stack
means tag
that shouldn't be Capital guys
okay
and
still like this also
Android
help
okay
so what this divider is doing
so this is a class that I'm that
bootstrap created for you guys for the
drop down divider so this divider is
creating one line here
and
keeping it separate from the upper upper
one so whenever you are writing
something here which is not relatable to
these things whenever you are creating
your website and you want something else
to be written not in that category so
this divider is you can use
is okay now disabled one is this is a
class that bootstrap have which is neb
link disabled so imagine you are
creating a website of your own and this
is your home page okay and this button
is not disabled this is just a reference
imagine there is one bottle called login
so here someone came to your website and
he is a new user so you want him to log
in
so this disable button will show him you
have to login first then then you can
access this page right without even
login in the this website you can't even
get into the page so this is just to add
one feature
okay we'll use this button also but
let's just name this as
okay let's name it as disabled only you
get to know right
so I'll
move forward and this is search only and
let's save this and see how is it did
okay so yeah and this is course page
full stack
and means that okay now what I'm going
to show you guys is okay first let's
just copy this link okay I'll just
copied this link simple right and I'm
going to go to this
Bank attack in this anchor tag I'm going
to remove this
Edge and I have pasted the link that I
copied and let's go back and here I'm
gonna write
mean stack
these are two amazing full courses
offered by simplylearn that you can opt
and master those full stack development
skills okay
these are very good just go through
these courses
okay let's just copy this thing
and paste it here now let's save it and
go back to our code
okay
now we don't have to refresh it because
we are using the live server
whenever I am going to the course
okay let's just delete this for now and
whenever I'm clicking on the full stack
it will redirect us to the
Caltech postgraduate program by full
stack I'm sorry postgraduate program in
full stack web development right and
whenever I am click on this means tag it
will again open the means type course
for us right so this is what a nebar is
wait I'm gonna tell you about more about
this ink attack so what this anchor tag
works as a religious
Li is a line
okay
these are some easy HTML tags that you
can refer from
these websites let me just
show you a website
okay just type this is bootstrap but if
you want to learn HTML you can write
here as
HTML
and this HTML will show you guys okay
and you can learn anything from here
HTML CSS okay these are all the
documentaries just get an idea from here
and just move on to the projects part
that can help you
okay
okay fine let's move ahead now
next we'll see how to use
okay let's just delete this one
and open our
next we'll see the component alert so in
this alert part you will see there are
so many colors like this one blue white
blue pink red this one is danger so in
bootstrap these all colors are having a
specific name like this one is a primary
this is says kendri success is a green
color danger red color warning is yellow
color info and these are some of the
other
according to me you will only use this
secondary one success danger warning
and
these are the four that I think you
should know
remember okay otherwise everything is
accessible
and these are some other codes also
and if you want anything from this you
can just copy this and use it inside
your website right okay
let's move on to the batch
inside this batch you will see these are
some examples of that and if you'll see
this looks like an H1 tag this is
actually an H1 tag these are the badges
okay whenever you add something after
that is a batch like this one
so the code for this is this one this is
very easy right
and for notification you can copy this
link
and if you want to use these kind of
like primary blue color secondary or
white green red yellow blue white black
so
if you don't want to use as a
rectangular rectangle box you can always
use a capsule class Like a Pill batch
okay
similar only
right okay so let me just show you how
to add this one okay
let's just copy the Inbox
and we'll go to our code
and inside this
before the search box or disable box let
me just see again
okay
after the disabled one we'll use this
and let's save it and let's see you will
see there is one inbox which is showing
us there are 99 messages and you can
also edit this
you will see here
please hold the search box let's you can
only one it will be one okay and if you
don't want to use any number you can
also use it and you can also use the API
to fetch the data from the behind and
that will increase the size of this you
just have to add the API here I'm not
doing it right now but if you want I can
do it in my other videos
okay guys let's move ahead and let's
remove it
because I don't want this button okay
let's move ahead and see there are
breadcrumbs so bread crumb indicates the
current page location within a
navigation hierarchy that automatically
adds inspectors via CSS so what this
will show us that this is the home
inside the home there is a library and
inside the Library this directory is
known as data so this will show us that
you can use Home Library like this a
greater than same
okay you can use these anything into
that you can use if you like something
you just copy this
and go to the your code after the
navigation bar paste it save it and go
to your code and see the magic
so this is home Home Library Home
Library data
but I don't think so I'm gonna use this
one
and this one so
I'm gonna delete this okay
let's delete this too
and inside this breadcrumb
I'm gonna write all the means
okay
so we'll just save it
back to the code
let's now add a
color component there okay
bad or
alert also we can add let's see how to
add one
let's add warning one
or danger
copy this one
added
navigation bar and C
so this is how this works
you can change this
as warning
save it and it will come as yellow light
okay
great
moving the head
you will see
so according to me I don't think so you
have to learn these things like warning
I just told you that uh just mean ones
are danger alert uh not alert alert is
not as
useful but dangerous success secondary
primary and warning are the ones that
are mostly used in the websites okay
so let's move ahead and I will see
anything else badge done
buttons now
so use bootstraps custom button styles
for Action in forms
dialogues and mode with support for
multiple style stage and more so what is
this buttons doing is if you want to use
any of these buttons whenever you hover
on this it'll going a little light you
can use these kind of buttons also and
you can use these kind of buttons also
I'm gonna use
one kind of everything to just get you
an idea how these works so I'm gonna use
as success
let's copy the success from here after
the background
I'm going to use this one
after this I'm gonna use a link
so link I have told you but I'll use now
a button okay
oh
the next line I'm gonna use button
after that and from this outline button
this the outline of this box will show
you as this is blue but whenever you
hover on the button it'll become
the color that it was
originated from
so from here I'm gonna use the warning
one
okay let's copy the button
okay
now let's save it and see how all of
these are looking
so these are all looking good right
now
let's move ahead and see
what's next
button group yeah right this is also
very important you can add not add this
in the top you can also add this in the
bottom you have seen so many uh
websites in the bottom there are
something called as one two three yeah
this one toolbar one two three four and
after that there is one button attached
to it is four which is next
it will again show you pages from that
last page that you have left from like
if I was on the second page and I
clicked on the after the arrow button
that fifth one and it will again show us
the third and if I'm in the fourth page
it will again redirect us to the fifth
page right so this is also a very good
feature of that
and you can use different sizes of
buttons these group buttons from left
middle right you can also use this one
this nesting button is also very useful
nowadays whenever you are doing first
button will click you from somewhere to
somewhere second will also do the same
and in the drop down you'll open the
link of the other pages
okay
so these are not very important buttons
but this must be useful whenever you are
creating a website and you will get to
use one of these These are also very
good
you can also use these ones
right also looking good
so I'm gonna show you how to use these
three
sizing ones okay or
not radio these are all are
just active link Link and Link this
active link is showing us that see if
I'm clicking on this link
it is not showing anything but if I'll
cut this
okay we're not can't edit it on this
bootstrap page only
so it's fine
okay whenever I'm clicking on this let's
let's add
okay and just copy the wrong one
okay let's just go to the group button
sizing yeah let's copy the code from
here and paste it
here let's save it and see how it's
yeah but we have to go to the next line
because it's I'm thinking that this is
the same div
it's fine so we can change this one also
now you will see
it's again coming
together
for the living
let's move ahead
now let's talk about cars so according
to me cards are the thing that you will
use so much in your code so the layout
for the card is like this it's just in
one container inside that container
there is one image part and then the
text part and then one link okay one
button where you will click and you can
go to another page so let's copy this
and go to my virtual Studio code and
let's remove these buttons okay
let's close this one
okay and let's paste it now save it and
see
right there's no image right now but
we'll add it
so you can add the image by just
downloading it
okay
or you can just
add like
industry call the name of the
let me just see
okay I just added one image here
in my folder so I'll use this one
so let's write it
one and
this is what
a alter does okay so what alter does is
if I'll write something like hello
but like
coding related pictures while riding
code okay now let's save it and let's
see so this card is looking like this
you can decrease the size of the image
like
okay
let's save this one it's looking much
nicer now okay so what this altered is
if I'll remove this link
and write dots okay
so this is what the car does sometimes
when you are running your code the image
doesn't load very fast so this alter
text we use to just write the something
instead of the image so whenever the
image takes a time to load this thing
will comes up and then the image okay
so this is what alter does so we sh if
you'll create a big
website this older tag should be there
and
now let's save it and let's check
anchor tag I have told you
okay
e tag is paragraph tag
div is a container that takes a
particular space
and then the image image tag in which
we'll use the source and all
okay everything is cleared as of now now
I'll tell you about one thing
which is an API to use the images
okay
so there is one website called
unsplash.com
where you can get
good images as well as as
the API to excess when you can get the
API from here and you can use the image
okay let's just
download this picture
okay
and now
let's add the image inside our project
right and now I'll copy
this container
and paste it again
and instead of this I'm gonna add the
let's save it but before that what I
have told you to format the document so
it should
look Gene right let's save it and go
back to your output
so this is how this is looking right now
I'll tell you how to access the API of
this
website okay
now let's copy this again
okay let's copy this card
this one
and paste it
here
okay now I'll show you how to access the
APA of this unsplash
okay so we'll write HTTP yes all this
GTP whether let me check who can
ctps
okay
and we'll write source
Source Dot unsplash
Edge
okay so we have the written this three
let's just save this file and check
whether it is working or not okay
so this is what we are getting we can
increase the size I've just declared the
size or
this we can write
5000 and this
will be very
it will take time to load the image of
this one
so this is the height that we have given
5000 and this one
so let's give it a similar height of
2000 and
2000 okay let's save it
and you must be thinking that every time
I refresh this site this images changing
this is because of this API
unsplash what this does is whenever I
refresh this page it'll give me a new
picture right
every time I just refresh it it'll give
me new picture
we can also add the
link here
you can copy that mean stack link
by Caltech or no not kill type one we'll
copy this mean stack full course
this is also a very good course
and here we'll write
means stack
you can also style these and
let's refresh this and you'll see I'll
zoom in
okay you whenever you click on this mute
stand
this means tag full course will be shown
to you it's a master program very good
you will learn so many things here
just check it out once the link will be
in the description
okay let's move forward
okay
now coming back to our code
let's see if there is any other card
that you can use this also you can use
with one image and a text
okay sometimes we use this one also
this is not very much used
and
so this is all about the
cards oh wait uh using grid maker
so what this does is this has assigned
one div okay this this div is taking
your
20 off the screen with the row height
okay this
these height if length will be 20. okay
so inside that it is split into two
parts you can split it into three parts
also by just giving it let me just show
you inside the code
okay let's delete
let's add it here
showing
so this is taking a less space because I
must have added this one in the old
okay
let's not add this inside this
C
whether it is coming inside this or not
with the
let's just remove the cards I guess
because of the cards it's taking similar
size okay so this is divided into two
parts right
so what we can do is
we can change the size of this so This
Is defined
in the starting only that this column is
small this is medium and this is small
so it is taking 6 7 8 9 and
and we can give it here
3.
so it should be 12. the sum of this
screen should be 12 like 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12. you can divide it that
rank also
okay now I'll just
copy one more or like
this one
is six okay
let's just copy this
write it three
okay let's save it and check whether it
is working so it came in the next line
so let's see what happened here okay
so let's give everything
similar Heights
this one has six this one has six so
these are two similar it tastes 12 so
this will obviously come to the next
line so now I'll show you how to
make it
so this is how
V so this is responsive also guys
let's inspect this and check
right
whenever it's less than the screen size
that it should come with it's going to
the next line
so this is how
this works okay
now
let's close this one and
come back to our code
and
yeah
so this is all I guess all about
and this is something that I should give
you a text alignment so text alignment
is this comes in the left side this is
Center and this is left this is pretty
simple
and navigation this is what I wanted to
tell you about
so let's copy this and
paste it inside your code
right
save it and show you how this looks
so this is how this is looking when I'll
go to the link page
if I have added anything in my link page
it'll go to that page else it will go to
the active page only so this button that
is shown here which is disabled is
similar to this one only okay
this is similar and this is something
that I have already told you some text
the graph lines and all and if you want
to go to somewhere you can just click
and give the anchor tag a location right
okay let's delete this one
and
go back to
this one okay the slider
this cell Idol will help you with the
images right
I'll copy this text code from here okay
and paste it
the top
let me just see okay after the
danger alert button we can add this song
right
now let's save it and inside the image
tag
we can just add the
or we can also add the
HTTP yes
okay
let's complete this one
okay so you are
source
splash
write the maximum space so it should be
16.
900 will be fine
yep
and question mark
Gooding and
she
let's save it
or let's copy this one so we can add it
everywhere
just
add it here also
okay
now if you will see this is how our
slider is looking
so you can just click here and
the next image will look but all the
image will be similar only that's why
okay let's change the name here and
let's name it as
water
and let's name it as fire
so it's a very bad combination right but
let's see how this
API works
so it's giving me a random images
it's a technology and water and all so
the next image
like this and this is how this images
are looking and whenever I refresh it
will again change all the images right
yeah let's move ahead now and let's see
what's inside this one this has one
indicators down that it is in the first
slide second slide third slide this is
also very good when you use it on your
site
and if you want to use like this you can
also use this one whenever you want to
label something so I'll use this one
this one looks very good to me
so let's remove this one all it's added
here only
okay
let's copy this
and paste it
and set this one
okay
where is the
link I have to put
let's add it here
and here
so we'll write here as code
machine is fine
Square y
let's save it and see how this one looks
so this is the old slider
and this one is the new slider so you
can see the text that it is showing me
and the paragraph
tag you can also write something here
that
let me just show you here also
and here also this one is looking much
beautiful than this one it's just about
the requirement sometimes we require
these kind of images and sometimes you
want these kind of images whenever you
want to showcase your text or something
informative you can use the slider right
let's move ahead now
let's see the close button
okay yeah
so this one is
used so many times
that let me just show you
whenever you want to close something
this tag is used
okay so it can be like this
it's pretty simple
now everything looks easy now okay I
want to now show you the important thing
okay
let me show you that
so open this one and inside this
let's open the layouts and inside that
there is one thing called grid so grid
is very important when you are using
anything not just bootstrap it's
important in CSS also so the current
system is what use our powerful mobile
first flexbox grid to build layouts for
all shapes and sizes thanks to 12 column
system that I have already told you that
the screen is divided into 12 part you
can divide it as your wish like four
four or six six or like anything but it
should total should be of 12 okay so SAS
variable and maximum
let's see something is important yeah so
the options of the grid system are it's
one of them are extra small which is
denoted by Excel excess that we have
already used here I have told you about
it
uh okay you must have deleted that one
but I have told you okay you can just go
back and see I have explained that also
and there is small which is denoted as
SM medium MD large l g extra large XL
and extra extra large which is XXL
okay so it's saying as noted above each
of these breakpoints have their own con
containers unique class prefix and
modifiers okay so they are now telling
us about how much size excess takes how
much pixel as SM takes MD and it's all
about this so the XXL should be less
than less than equal to 1400 pixels okay
okay now Auto layout columns are like
this one
which is divided into two parts this one
is divided into three parts
and now this one is wider
than this too okay
and this is how this one works right
okay
let's move ahead
okay
this theme that I have told you earlier
also so responsive container responsive
container allows you to specific a class
that is 100 wide until the specified
breakdown is reached so I'll tell you
about the containers I'll explain you
rather okay so just now we have created
this
this uh slider cursor or slider let's
modify this one
so the end point and the starting point
is this one okay
if we'll create
one div okay let's write
this one
if
if I'll write Dev Dot
here
inner and let's enter and
delete this from here
and write it here
save it and you'll see something
different now this images are inside one
container right this is not taking full
screen like this one it's inside the
container okay so it's not taking full
screen it's taking just the inner part
so it's just giving this image a border
so it's working completely fine okay
okay let's move ahead and now I'll show
you one thing
with just give me a second I'll
ex wanted to explain one more thing look
at this one Auto layout okay
let's copy this one
and
instead after this
David
and let's just format the document
and now
you as you can see it's taking one of
two
two of two one of three this line This
div line is container is divided into
two parts
one and two and this bottom one is
divided into one two and three now let
me give it okay let's just close this
one
okay so these are my two rows and inside
that row there are two columns okay
now in this row I will give
okay and inside this one I'm going to
give BG
Danger
so before that I just I've told you
earlier also the success is denoted as
green color and the danger is United as
red one
okay let's just save it and see
how it is looking so this one is divided
into two parts again and this one is
divided into three parts okay we can
change the color of any one also
like
if I want to change the color of this
column
to BG light so I'm not light warning for
yellow
let's save it and you will see
this one is looking yellow right so this
is about the this one Auto layout
columns okay
and everything looks the same
now let's talk about modal so what this
model will do if you use it inside your
website so whenever you click on any of
the link it will pop up a
cursor like this
okay so you can use this one also this
is also very good feature like not like
that launch demo model not like that if
someone's click on the username and
password imagine and if the user will
click and you want to show him that this
is the wrong email ID that he is putting
or she is putting so you can this also
in that
or if you want to send a message
whenever someone click on any button and
this pop-up will come and it will say do
you want to save the changes that you
have done and will it say yeah changes
are
saved okay
like this one also
and there are so many like this only
okay
so let's copy one and
and write it inside of a code
don't worry I'll give you all the code
in the description box with the website
code we are going to create a website
I'm just clearing your basics in
bootstrap now we'll start working on our
website okay
so this one is a modal
now let's go back to the code
so whenever I click
it will come the text so we can add the
text here
and say
welcome to Simply learn
right
and
whenever anyone clicks on this
and it will show
welcome to Simply you can change these
button text everything you can change
and if you want to cross just click on
the cross button
right okay let's see if there is
anything important before we start our
website
view buttons are similar
right
yeah
and I will talk about something else
okay
Bob overs are done
these are like similar to that one only
whenever you click it will just show you
a text
there only not just the pop out like
this one like the models it's not like
models
but it will let's just
format the document now so it should
look clean so
really and whenever any user will click
on this hello
it should show a text but let's copy
that one also
so this is just a button
okay the power title
the content okay
so we will write
let's save it
you can also use the next one also if
it's not working so whenever anything
doesn't work in your website when while
you are creating a website just click on
the inspect and the code so in last we
use this one
let's go back to this button so we'll
check whether it is working or not
this button
okay
see
let me right click understood
okay
let's change the button
let's go back let's delete this one
you can customize our buttons also here
and there are four directions in the
bottom if you are creating a page where
you want to go pop over on top
[Music]
left so if you are using a website this
is used when I want to declare my
message in the left side of the uh that
page
okay let me copy one
which is bottom
okay and let's paste it
here
going back to my code
it's not working let's check
so whenever I click on this pop over on
bottom it's not showing me message but
you can check it and then we can well
the message is not declared in this
right okay fine let's move on
to the main website that we are going to
create now okay
now this is everything you need to know
about bootstrap I'm sure there are so
many other small small things okay like
uh
that we have discussed okay you can just
go and on in starting only we just took
this neighbor okay
so now what I'll do is I'll open my
Virtual Studio code
and I'll change the name of this
index.html to something else okay so we
can use it as
I told you
yeah so you'll think what I why I'm
doing this so I want to create my
website that I'm gonna show you right
now so I'm gonna name that mean file as
index
okay
so the main file is created now
okay so it's showing an error can't get
index.html this is why because it is it
can't fetch the index.html file at that
moment because we have it run this one
file on live server whenever I'll run
this file online server it will open
okay like this one it is a blank file
because we haven't added anything inside
this one
so now
we will just
open the bootstrap
[Music]
file and here we'll write
starter
starter template okay we'll just copy
this one and paste it inside our
index file okay
we will change the
simply done and here also we'll write
something else
and just delete this one because we
don't need this
and in Array bag we will write English
let's just check whether it is working
or not
hello
let's check whether it is working
yeah hello from Simply done
so we'll
let's just
do this
comment
okay
should work
okay let's just
so will
let's check whether it's saying
option JavaScript choose one of the two
okay
we can only choose one of the two
so what we can do is
we can just come in this one
let's just
delete these options and save it and go
back to the bootstrap
brand
copy this one
so
I told you because
this is all
the same
and when I will come back here I just
paste this
and we'll just go format document it
will make it look
feel
now we'll go
and check whether it is working
and let's see why it's coming on the
right side of our screen
okay I forgot to delete the direction of
the text it is saying direction right
so we don't want this thing but maybe
you will need whenever you are creating
your website so now it's working
completely fine right okay let's move
ahead
and now we will copy the nav bar we'll
go back to this and copy the component
in that part
and
this one is looking good that we have
already used so we'll go back here and
delete this hello and
paste it here and the Nail Bar will read
simply learn
think
course and action
right
new stack
right
stack
you'll just watch you'll see something
good so this divider is doing his work
that I have already told you
in the starting when we were creating
the never so here we'll write
help okay
and this one is disabled
wait let's make it as disabled one only
just for the
your knowledge let's save it and see
whether it is looking
yeah
drop down is working fine
right
yeah
the code working
we can change the and lips
give it a
via
if I never
drop down
save it with it to see
heads we can change the line because
it's coming on the right side because of
this one only
right you can just delete these
we can just Place alter
and again press alter and we'll just
click
and it will work as a two cursor but we
are using only one then only we can
click this at anywhere else and it will
be
same okay
so now this class is inside the UL which
is ordered list
we can unordered list actually
we can change this one as div
okay
let's just save this one again
now
this one right
this will copy the whole component again
and paste it
after the courses okay
here we'll write
about
and here all right
courses only
but will
copy this component
and look cut it and paste it here so the
it should show home about courses and
then the drop down in the drop down will
say
okay we can just cut this off okay let's
just see the output first
so this is how it was looking before so
we'll take the name as
this drop down to
courses
this will delete
what we can do is
home about topics
[Music]
home about topics inside the drop down
works
then we will not use this
disabled one
Surah I will copy this component
and paste it under this and
write it here as
practice
okay
let's just see
how our home is looking
so everything's looking great
here I have written two things but it's
fine
okay
here you can just
next we'll do is
we can
add to our code
and we can add the
links
to this one only and write full stack
inside this whole stack we'll copy this
graduate program in first type of
development by Caltech
and paste it
on the
this will start
and in means time I'll again go back to
my
file
because I'm on the page and see
whether it is working
then the web development there is no
okay
see inside of everything is
okay data science
[Music]
and here you'll find the moon start
copy the link
paste it under
this
game will format the document
okay
yeah
let's save it
let's check
now what I'll do is
I'll copy this one
and let's just make the symbol on book
bold so I'm going to use this
V tag which is also known as
bold
save it and see the simply learn logo
written is looking
bold
you can change the side of this home
about topics contact us from the right
to left okay
so for that what I'm going to do is
so I just copied this code from my
previous folder and paste it inside this
one so what I am doing here is I have
added the Old Link let's change the
team
stuck okay
let's just change the link from here
and I will tell you about the code that
I have written okay
let's just go here and only and check
for Moon's time
so this is very easy right
I'm just typing and everything is
let's just
paste it here
okay now what we have done here is we
have given this home page this home one
a class current so whenever I'll open
this side my index page it will
highlight me the color of this home so
I'll create if I'll create the two pages
like I have created here
I have created two three pages for about
and like if I click on about the current
page in this file is this about and
whenever I will click on the contact us
the current that I have given the class
is this okay so here I added one class
as Sr only okay
let's remove the
location from here and add here Edge
here also
will remove and add
the location blank so whenever I
create one file for this one we can just
declare the right
so what here I have done is I have added
two buttons for login and sign up
will not cover the login and sign up in
this video but if you want me to add
these features and you want to me to
show you
and create these two we can always do
that just pin down the comment in the
comment section below that you want to
see more videos on bootstrap and more
projects on videos
okay
let's move ahead so this is all about
what are the changes that I have done
here
okay now let's save it

here is browser
let's open the browser and select which
one I'll need in my website so this is
the basic one I have showed you this one
also I have showed you
okay but I'll use this one this one I
have also showed you previously so let's
copy this one and paste it after the nav

and here
I'll change it
award meaning
okay
okay
let's save it
add the images here let's see so this is
looking like this
okay because we haven't added any
picture here right now
okay
so what I'll do is
I'll go back to my
code
and add the source of the images so I'll
add two three pictures here
now I have added two three pictures here
like
this one this one this one and this one
okay now let's add these pictures the
first image that I'll take up is this
one 33 PNG so I'll write 33 dot PNG

second Dot
G let's save it and see if it's working
so yeah
it's working fine let's see in the image
of this closed one
this one is taking a little time to load
okay
let's
just delete this one
let's see whether I have added one
and this line is cursed down
slider
this one looks good
33 1 and use the other picture which is
other one
okay we have added the images here now
now let's see which is so yeah it's
working fine now welcome to Simply learn
the best coding bootcamp you can change
the text of this one and I have written
a small line a data science School stack
and many more okay and here also award
winning bootcamp all right
now we cannot go to any page rise up now
but
let's go back and check
now in our main file we have created
three buttons here
technology web development and data
science okay so we'll add these three
now
so for that
I'll go after this one and write a
command
button
okay
okay let's and let's name it as click
Lottery and let's give it a class for
EDM that I have showed you median and
first one I'll give
frankly
save it and check whether it is working
yeah technology is in Google we can
change the color and now we have to add
red one which is
the red one is danger and green one is
successful so let's add that also
okay I'll copy this button and paste it
here and again paste it
and let's change from primary
to
success and from here
we will write Danger
here I'll write
back
if you are looking for a full start
course you can always
click on the button and you can go to
the main page
here I'll add data science
okay
let's now we have added three buttons
here
now I'll
three buttons to every
out of the screen let's save it and
check
house side looking so this is our
website
so this one is looking
great
and now let's check if it's responsive
or not
okay
so we'll go to
iPhone x SC
so this is how in XC it will look like
when I will click on this these three
four buttons will come now if I'll be on
iPad Air it'll look like this
right
yep
so this is how we add the images now
without wasting our time
let's move ahead and add these four
cards
okay and also write this line
move ahead
after this one
and
I'll go back to the bootstrap Queen and
open the cards
and here
will use this card
okay
so for that I love let's cut this into
bed
and this is little
go ahead
now I'll add the cards so we'll go back
to the
templates here in the examples holder
if you'll see there are so many already
built features in bootstrap that you can
directly use
so let's see these cards
okay we can also use this one
but let me check out others also
I have used
previously that I have showed you in
this one
not in this one yeah in this one
I have used blockcast okay
let's use that also
we use that also in our code so let's
open the blog
so inside this block if I want to add
only I need only these two cards right I
don't want the other content so what
I'll do is I'll right click inspect
and then I'll go to the main
container of this one
so this is the main as you can see in
the inspect so right click copy
copy
full path
inside after this
container one okay this one note
yeah
here I'll create one div
of container
div
Dot
dinner inside that I will
talk or either
okay let's copy again
response Style
copy element
paste it here
right click form a document right
now I'll save this file and check
whether it is working
yeah it is completely working fine now I
want to give margin on the top because
it's looking very clumsy here so what
I'll do is I'll go back to my container
class
right
so this is my main container so what
I'll write here is M by
4 so what is this is it'll give a margin
of 4 okay let's check
yeah it is giving a margin of 4 right
so
here I have taken 4 only right
okay we'll add the images here in a
while don't worry about that
so what I'll do is
and move ahead now we'll add the images
here
so inside this container that we have
just now created so they are using SVG
okay so will not use the SVG we'll use
the image
okay
for image you know use
class
and inside the class I'm gonna give it a
class of
right now but let's add it easy
please
please the image
after that I'll give it a width
of
200
and height
of 250 okay and then I will give the
source of the image and the source of
the image would be this one
let's save it and see if it's working
will be fine yeah it's working
completely fine we can change the name
of slow and let's change the new world
as
tickle
article on
web development okay and this is fine
okay now let's change this also from
Article 2

strap
let's save it and let's delete the SVD
from here also
and copy the image tag that we just now
created
inside this okay
yeah
this one we have just now created and
we'll paste it inside this
and let's save it and see if both are
looking good yeah article blog your
development bootstrap okay
yeah
so
now we need two more
okay so what I'll do is I'll copy and
paste
two more right
I'll see whether is this step ending so
I'll copy from that
and paste it after this one
right let's save it and check

so what I'll do is I'll change the
images now
for that I have to add different images
to
run right 12
here and right
33 but 12 is
ENT
let's save it and see
this one is not looking this one is
looking so clumsy I don't want to use
this one
so let's change this one also from 12 to

here I will use
Note 1
are you can use this one
right
and choose
D5 let's save it and check
these two are not looking very good
you can download it okay
let's go back to my code and here and
the bootstrap

David

before let's save it and check
okay
add this one third one no
okay one two third this one
so we'll add
or
this one we can add
okay we have this one also
so we will add this here
save it
check how it is looking now so this is
how this one is looking right this is
looking amazing right now let's move
ahead
now what we'll do is we'll create
another file
about
okay
now here we'll
create new file about
HTML right
we can also use the API that I told you
about unsplash one and you can also use
that in the source and the images will
change I want to use these images so
that's why I am using that but if you
want you can also use the splash
unsplash so we'll open the tutorial HTML
P that we have created earlier and copy
the URL
from there of the images
right so let's copy the image
this is the URL
and paste it inside your wherever where
you want to add the image so this one is
repeating as well
at the
so now you will see every time I will
refresh this image will
refresh right
okay I will change the name from Cars to
something else
technology right
now let's see how the images are coming
yeah
[Music]
okay
now
let's move forward
to the
about page
in the about page it's very simple for
us right
the about page is very simple because I
have done nothing in the about page just
added the template as it is
so what I'll do is
the about dot HTML and firstly I'll copy
the
whenever from here so what I'll do is
I'll copy
from F Bar
check whether the new button please
okay
because we don't need yeah yeah
so let's
not copy this one
let's copy from
now let's add the footer first I forgot
to add the footer
so
the footer will come after the container
of that right so I have added the footer
inside this footer I have given it a
class of container inside the footer
it's a float right so it will come in
the right position here I have given the
back to top button so whenever I'll
click on that back to button it will
take me on the upside of the page on the
let's check if it's working fine so this
is how the folder will look so whenever
I'll click on the back to top it will
take us on the top right
yeah
so let's move ahead to create this one
so let's copy first
the nav bar that we have created
from here
till Tom let's copy and paste
and then from down
will copy from the footer
paste it
okay let's save it and check
also it will not work as if as right now
but whenever I'll click on
about dot HTML
it will work right so right now in this
about page there is nothing so what I'll
do is
I'll do some changes in this
I'll change this
from
this
okay
this thing is done now what I'll do is
I'll change the source of this one
whenever I click on this
home button
should open
on the
let's go back
so this is
about is still not working let's fix
this
for that this link is wrong because it's
a URL not the
so what I'll do is I'll open the this
one
and click on this image
on this file actually
and I'll check for the URL on this
so what I'll do is
now here in this about dot HTML file I
have done few changes let me just uh
share with you all the details okay so
here I have created one nearby that I
have already showed you that I have
copied that from the index file and a
footer from index only okay
now here we have created
three images
these three parts like the main file
I'll just click and show you
so this is the main file that I have
showed you in the starting that I have
created okay in the about page as you
can see there are three images right now
we'll see how to add these three images
into our project
now what I'll do is I'll change the
source of the images
to
yeah this one is good so I'll choose one
dot
G now let's see and see whether it is
coming or not
let's refresh this yeah so the image is
coming okay we'll add two more images
here so we'll select two images
okay I don't have that image so we'll
add the images here we can add this one
but it's so very big image so we will
add two images more
now I have added these three images that
I have used in that folder
okay so I'll write about Slash one so
here also I have added this scene gpg
these three images that I have used okay
now here we have creating a
class component with the image that I
told you right now and here I am writing
something and this is the chunk leader
now what I want to tell you that I have
used one class row featured and then we
have used D Flex justify content Center
in with this the help of justify content
Center the content that we are using
that this container is coming in the
center of the
page okay and then I have used align
items center right in all the three
now let's see how's the output
let's refresh and see
this is however about Pages looking
right this is looking great and now
let's see whether
how was the is exactly the same because
we have used the same images that we
have used in the this file right now
I'm gonna create a contact page that we
have created here so this contact page
will create right now okay
coming back to our Visual Studio code
here I am going to right click and add
contact
dot HTML okay
here we'll again copy the
content from here
let's copy from here to
where the dev ends
no buttons here so we'll copy from here
and from
go
from footer to the components so we'll
copy
and paste right now what I want to do is
we have to give the extensions
so the source of the image and all okay
now we have created these three
inside this 3 will give
the
source of the image right so in the
contact page then anybody clicks on the
index will copy the path
and add the
index is already covered so contact
index is already covered so I'll copy
the path of the above HTML page
and pasted inside the
this was not the right file so I'm gonna
go back to my
contact node HTML file and here
inside the contact I will remove this
one and paste this okay let's save it
and then
not here
will add it
you know
okay this was home
here we have to put
in the contact we will delete this part
and copy the path of this and add it
here
let's save it and see how is it looking
let's refresh and let's click on the
this was the document file okay
both of them are open
that one so we'll go back to our code
and click on index and open the index
file
okay so we'll click on contact us so
it's not opening right now so what will
we do
about this opening
the home is also working fine
yeah so what I'll do is
for the contact page
it's accessing the wrong path right so
what I'll do is I'll change the path
from that
because maybe it's excess in the
butter
that document page right
so what I'll do is I'll change the path
of this
on that
so what I'll do is
so what I did is I remove this pan for
current page from home and about to
conductors let's save it and see whether
it is working fine or not
okay
so it's still showing about
so what I will do is
we'll check again
document
this let's click here
it's still accessing the document file
so let's check why it is accessing the
contact HTML file
okay
to be here we have given the wrong path
of the contact yeah as you can see here
we have given the wrong path
okay so what we'll do is we'll copy the
path of this file
and paste it
inside this component
let's paste it inside here
and we'll go back to
index.html and from hash to
path of the original file
now we'll refresh it
and go back to home about contact us
still it is accessing let's check now
what is the issue now
inside the about we have given the right
path or not
okay
the path has changed now
let's check whether it is
showing this wrong path
now let's again check the path of
everything
okay this has the right path
contact us
okay users and then everything is fine
with about
they have given the right path to this
one
and this one
about we haven't given any paths so we
can give or not it's fine
it's one I'm also giving the right path
now let's check
and let's delete this one
and let's
remove go back to learn index let's open
this one
let's click yeah it is completely
working fine now
so for the contact details what we are
going to do is we're gonna open our
contact.html file
and here we'll add the components
now what I'll do here is
I'll create
one
class
okay
container class
at this container I'm gonna give it a
margin of
4 again like about page
let's close this one
and inside this I'm gonna write in H2
contact
us okay
after that I'm gonna use the form
we can also copy the template from here
okay
go back to
forms so we'll search it here
forms
here we if we need email and password we
can use this one
like that there are so many other
templates also okay
so what I need is I need this one which
is the basic one
so I'll copy this from here
and I'll paste it
so I don't need this form tag here
and from here
let's see if we can check
how will this look good
this is how this one is looking we'll
write password Here
and then press submit okay
so this is our main file we have added
three four different check boxes if you
want I can also add the check boxes
so let's see how the check boxes are
created
okay
after this password
I'll write
it's right here
div of class
form
row inside this what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create another class
okay
and let's name it as
called
small
you know
what we call it for small and then we'll
write
our
uh
subscriber
okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna give another
class
of column
small
of 10 I have already told you it should
be a total of them should be 12. the sum
should always be
12.
so
let's give it another class of
form check
so what form check will do it will
create a check box for us
so that you can just get an idea okay
so here I'll write input
class
um
check
input
and let's write it
type should be a check box
okay and then I've already told you what
is an ID
ID is
specific to someone
okay
so I'll write grid check
one
foot
paste it here and make some changes as
label so it will give us a
box we don't need the check box now we
need a container so what I'll do is I'll
change from ID into
for
okay
let's now check whether it is fine or
not
yeah it's fine let's write yes
and let's check how it is looking so
this is how it is looking
are you a subscriber yes here I'll write
yes
check me out
and then here we'll write email password
and then submit
so with this we have read the end of

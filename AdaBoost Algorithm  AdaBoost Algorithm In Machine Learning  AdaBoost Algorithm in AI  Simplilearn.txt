hello everyone and welcome to Simply
Lars YouTube channel today in this video
we are diving into a powerful machine
learning algorithm that is made waves in
the world of data science adab boost
whether you are a beginner or experienc
data scientist understanding adab boost
is crucial for building robust and
accurate predictive models but what
exactly is adab Boost adaboost short for
adaptive boosting is an unable learning
technique that combines multiple
classifiers to form a strong classifier
think of it as a term of experts working
together where each expert focuses on
their areas where others might have made
mistakes so by the end of this video you
will be clearly understand how adab
boost work why it is so effective and
how you can implement it in your
projects so we will start by breaking
down the concept of boosting and how
adab boost fits into this category then
we will dive into how the algorithm
adapts by assigning different weights to
each instance focusing more on mistakes
made by a previous model this unique
approach help us to reduce errors and
improve model accuracy significantly to
make things even clearer we will walk
you through a practical example showing
you step by step how adab boost can be
applied to solve real well problems
whether you are working on
classification problem or trying to
improve your model performance adab
boost is the technique you will want in
your toolkit so stay updated and by end
of this video you will not only
understand adab boost but but also feel
confident in using it to boost your own
models craving a career upgrade

the description box below and the pin
comment so without any further Ado let's
get started so what is boosting in
machine learning boosting refers to the
process of creating a strong learner
from a collection of weak Learners a
week learner is a model that performs
only slightly better than random
guessing on the training data by
iteratively adjusting the weights of the
training instances boosting algorithm
assign higher importance to
misclassified instances forcing
subsequent weak Learners to focus on
these challenges samples the final
prediction is determined by aggregating
the prediction of all weak Learners with
higher emphasis placed on those that
demonstrate Superior performance so now
move forward and see types of boosting
in machine learning types of boosting
algorithm the first one is add a boost
add adaptive boosting adab boost is the
most popular boosting algorithm it
assign ways to train instances and
adjust these weights based on the
performance of weak Learners it focuses
on misclassified instances allowing
subsequent weak Learners to concentrate
on these samples and the final
prediction is determined by aggregating
the prediction of all week Learners
through a weighted majority vote the
second one is gradient boosting gradient
boosting is a widely used boosting
algorithm that builds an enable of
decision learning the the third one is
XG boost algorithm which is also known
as extreme gradient boosting XG boost is
an advanced boosting algorithm that
combines gradient boosting with
regularization techniques the fourth one
is light GBM light gradient boosting
machine light GBM is a high performance
boosting algorithm that uses a Lea wise
approach to construct de centries so now
let's see what is adaboost algorithm so
there are several machine learning
algorithms available to address your
problem statement and adab boost is one
of these powerful productive modeling
techniques known as adaptive boosting so
adab boost is an anible method in
machine learning it commonly uses desent
Tre with just one split often called
diffusion stems as its base estimator in
this approach the model initially assign
equal weights to all the data points it
then increases the weight of the
incorrectly classified points in
subsequent models these points with
higher weight are given more attention
the process continues training new
models until the overall error is
minimized so now let's see working of
adaboost algorithm so this image
illustrate an example of adaboost
algorithm using the data set provided
okay so this is a classification problem
since the targeted column is binary
initially each data point will be
assigned an equal weight as you can see
1X 5 okay so the sample weights are
calculated using this following formula
and here n denotes the total number of
data points okay in step two we will
first assess how well gender classifies
the samples followed by evaluation of
how the variables age and income perform
in classifying the samples for each
feature we will create a decent stump
and calculate its Guinea index the tree
with the data lowest guine index will be
selected as a first system let's assume
that in our data set gender has the
lowest guine index making it our first
step so in step three using this
approach we will now determine the
amount of say or importance or influence
for this classifier and categories dat
data points using this formula okay here
the total error is just the sum of
misclassified data Point sample weights
if there is one incorrect output in our
data set thus our total error is 1x5 and
the alpha performance of this STM okay
using this so now we will find out the
performance of the stemm so using this
formula here zero represent a Flawless
stemm while one represent a bad stem so
according to this graph where zero is
misclassification there is no error
hence the amount of say Alpha you can
say will be a huge value okay when the
classifier predicts half correctly and
half incorrect the total error is 0.5
and the classifier signif amount of say
equals to0 okay and if all the samples
were improperly categorized the error
will be quite large about to one and our
Alpha value will be negative integer
Okay negative integer you can say minus
two okay in step four you might be
wondering why it's necessary to
calculate as stms total error and
performance the reason is
straightforward we need to update the
weights because if the same weights are
used in the next model it will yield the
same result as previous one the weights
of incorrectly predicted points will be
increased while those of the correctly
predicted points will be decreased okay
more emphasis will be plays on the
points with higher weights so after
assessing the classifier significance
the total error we update weights using
this formula new sample weight equals to
Old weight multip by amount of C Alpha
okay when the sample is successfully
identified the amount of say you know
Alpha will be negative and the when the
sample is misclassified the amount of of
alpha will be positive you can see here
plus and minus there are four correctly
categorized samples and one incorrectly
classified sample so in this case the
sample weight of the data point is 1x5
and the quantity of sa performance of
The Gentle stamp is
0.69 okay so these are the following new
sample weights okay so this is the
adjusted weight for incorrectly
categorized okay 0.398 so here the total
sum of the weights must equal 1 but the
updated weights add up to
0.84 to normalize them we divide each
weight by
0.84 making the total sum equals to one
after normalization the DAT weights now
sum to one okay see now sum to one so in
step five we must know how to create a
fresh data set to see whether or not the
mistake have decreased to do this we
will delete the same and new sample
weights column and then split our data
points into buckets based on new sample
weights okay and in Step six we are
almost done here the method now selects
random values between 0 to one since
misclassified records have higher sample
weights so they are more likely to be
selected let's say the algorithm
randomly select the number
0.38 or 0.26 or anything next we will
see where the these random number Falls
within the Ved range and create our new
data set so this is our new data set so
in Step seven the the new data set will
be used to repeat the previous steps
start by assigning equal ways to each
point identifying this term the best
classify the sample of calculating the
guine index and selecting the one with
the lowest value so assume we have
sequently built three DEC entries dt1
d22 and dt3 using our data set okay so
when we run our data set through these
trees the class with the majority will
be determined and we will make
prediction based on that so with this we

welcome back and today I'm going to be
talking about unity my name is christos
Matias I am a product marketing manager
for unity and mobile and I have really
created interesting this product you
probably have had a lot of announcements
throughout the two days so far so dotnet
core Visual Studio and visual studio for
Mac so today what I want to show you and
why I wanted to pick up this session is
because I wanted to showcase that with
dotnet you can build some amazing things
including games right
our agenda for today is very simple I'm
going to introduce unity to you just to
let you know what it is and what he can
build with it and then I'll show you how
to get started if you never done get
into gaming before like I haven't so
it's a great experience to see how you
can set up your machine then I will show
you why you want to use Visual Studio or
visually for Mac to write your games and
we'll do that a few demos just to
showcase the capabilities and finally
we'll talk about why Visual Studio is so
well aligned with unity and what makes
it such a great product for debugging
and writing your games or your 3d
real-time applications and hopefully at
the end we'll leave you with some
learning materials and set you up for
the next few sessions of the day so
getting started unity of course is a is
a the most widely used real-time 3d
framework right it started as a gaming
team but now they're targeting different
industries so the goal there is to give
you the tools to create applications for
not just games but 3d real-time
applications and they're the most widely
and known engine and it's built on
dotnet so if you are Dalton a developer
there's nothing stopping you from
writing games starting today and the
nice thing about unity is that you don't
just have one platform but you have over
25 different platforms whether you want
to develop games for xbox whether you
want to build solutions for the run on
Windows or Mac OS obviously mobile is
very big mobile games are fantastic
these days and many people monetize on
that so if you want to build things for
that and that's also their TV OS that
the platform is insane so taking your
dotnet skills with a unity and our IDs
means that you can build almost
anything for any platform out there and
getting started obviously the first
thing that you need to do and you need
to be aware of is that ever since twin
2019 point to version of unity things
have changed quite a bit on how you
install and unity so there are two ways
to get started with unity one is you go
to the unity website and you download
the Installer and then allows you to
actually go and get the bits that you
need so it's a unity first experience
and many developers that know unity will
start from there but if you're already a
Visual Studio developer there is a way
for you to add the unity workload to
allow you to get started so we'll we'll
see how you do both so if you're inside
Visual Studio that you select the game
development with unity and that will
download the unity dependencies for you
and the other way around if you are
ready on unity then you can go and add
the components that you need so if you
aren't on V on Mac OS then it will
download the adversity for Mac
components if you're on Windows it's
clever enough to let you know that you
need to download Visual Studio so I
already have both the installers here so
if you're in visited installer it's just
going to modify it kicks off the
modification of the latest version that
you're using today we're using 16/3
which is the latest and greatest and if
I scroll down here you'll find out they
have selected a game development with
unity if you don't have it selected you
add that and we'll bring down all the
necessary dependencies so I can close
that off and if I go to the unity hub up
until this point that didn't exist so
you download directly unity and get
started but now and they have a unity
hub like the views to the Installer and
allows you to add multiple versions of
unity because certain things may not be
working with the latest version of unity
especially their component engine and so
here you just come to install you add
your installation and then from here you
can also add modules so in this instance
you'll notice that we already have the
Unity game development checked in
because we went from the Visual Studio
workflow first but if you don't have it
if you start with unity then that's the
way you get started and that's all you
need as soon as you do that
if we jump back the slides you'll notice
that there are certain things both in
inside unity and the visual studio
installer that show you that everything
has been configured correctly so we're
ready to go with this ones and what this
one is telling here for the external
tools is that if you are working with
unity and you are on Windows it has
already recognized Visual Studio 2019 as
present and I've already checked in the
editor attaching because one of the big
things that you want to do is as you
write your code for your games you want
to make sure that you can debug the code
right and you want to do it in velocity
because it's the best editor out there
so next we're going to look at why would
you want to use Visual Studio or
velocity for Mac over say notepad or
OneNote or whatever there are if you if
you've been developing for a long time
with Visual Studio you probably know
some of these capabilities but if you're
not if you're new to TV studio or if you
just focus on unity then I would like to
highlight some of the big features here
obviously refactoring as big as your
code grows you want to be able to
quickly jump into the code and change
things move them around clear your code
and what-have-you so you can always use
the mouse and right-click on the line or
you can instantiate the command by using
ctrl or command dots and you can go
straight to definitions I will show
these in and then demo very quickly you
can navigate the compiled assemblies you
can get suggestions for variable names
the idea guides you through a lot of a
good practices and would try to give you
the tools that you need to build good
code so if you're creating a method that
you want to duplicate for example then
we can quickly do that in the code there
are a lot of tools there to make you
more productive with the scripting in
your games Multi cursor mode editing we
got global certs and that's very big
because if you have a big codebase and
as your codebase grows you want to be
able to quickly search and find a
different components in your code going
to enclosing block if you have big
blocks of code and finally whether
you're working on Visual Studio
or video for Mac and you'd like a
specific set of bindings then we also
give the ability to actually switch the
bindings around around so if you're
envious to do for Mac there's a setting
there tells you I want to use my visual
studio key bindings and since I have
both machines as well I like to have
that consistency across the two IDs so
you can do that as well and next one we
have Intel akkad some people may already
know intelligence and Intel quad is is
the next level
it's the AI guided intelligence that you
get inside your code and it's always
context aware as well I will do a demo
on how Intel code works and how you can
improve your game coding visit of your
life sir this is a life-changing
experience because up until this point
you maybe have been developing in teams
or developing in isolation and you
always get stuck right yeah there's
always the internet but there's nothing
as somebody out there that can help you
out
so using live server you can actually
set up a session to sir your existing
coding environment with somebody else so
there could be somebody sitting three
hours away from you watching TV on their
on their you know on the surface go and
then you call them and say I'm stuck
with this solution here in my game I
don't know what to do can help me out
and you can actually spin up a session
inside Visual Studio they could be
sitting on the sofa playing with their
vision studio code doing some web
development they don't need to have the
exact same setup you'll be setting your
environment so live sir allows you to
unblock it allows you to share your
environment and find solutions to
problems sometimes you can use it for as
a learning experience as well so that's
really important I will show you how to
spin up a live search session if you
want to we have built in source control
obviously if you're using git and most
people these days tend to use git and we
do have built in an ID support there we
have real-time code analysis that's very
important as you write your code you
want to have real-time feedback you
don't want to have to write your code
save it and then build it only to find
out that something is not as you like it
to be that also includes some of the
things that I'll be talking later like
rosin analyzers and getting a
get feedback about the quality or the
errors in your code editor config is
very big
lots of people talk throughout the
conference so far about a tour config
and how it ties very well with visual
studio or visitor for Mac and for those
people that have not used a tour config
before it's it's a way to actually
define a code how the code should look
and behave how you want your variables
to be declared how you want your spaces
and tabs to be declared in your code if
you want to go down the route and
because it's a file that is checked into
your solution it follows the code
everywhere you go so if a new developer
joins the team then editor config allows
them to pick up the exact same code
habits if you want and apply them to
their code base as they code a code
lence gives you a very quick glance
about how your code and has changed over
the times and over the years how many
seconds you had for a specific method
and what have you and then some other
capabilities obviously if you're
changing across machines if you work at
the office and then you come home and
you pick up the work you can actually
synchronize your settings for the IDs
across those devices and across those
environments so you can have a
consistent Windows layout you can have a
very consistent look and feel so if
you'd prefer dark themes and that's how
it works and then we have custom screen
layouts which you can save as well and
then take them with you and if you
didn't know we're at the support light
and dark themes on your ID to make it
look and feel as you would like to so
next I'm going to jump to a couple of
demos and we're going to talk about some
of the things I have shown you already
so moving back to my code and we'd have
talked about refactoring so usually when
you are sitting in your ID you can
control dot and then we get intelligence
and says you know we can remove those
usings and you know make sure that you
don't have them anymore
you can also fix on all document or
projects and all solution so if you
brave enough you can apply that setting
across to the whole solution so let's do
the document over here you'll see it
says I can preview your changes and then
you can apply them we have things like
limited to another one you can see here
again we have fixes
talked about the multicolored editing so
if I were to say I add new methods I
could do control out dot and then select
multiple locations or control shift dot
sorry control out select one two that
seems to not working okay I move on but
we can also do multi line editing so if
you're here and you want to change from
private to public and go public and
automatically applies again we do
support multi carry at editing across
the files but let me change that back to
private we don't want to break our code
okay so this one I did talk about a tour
config and they just way to showcase
these if I jump into my files desktop
and I can I already have an editor
config they just way to get started I
find is if you jump to the Roslin repo
on github
they have already an ATAR config that is
pretty well tweaked so far so as soon as
we drop the editor configure there
you'll see we have all these different
settings and obviously you can also
change them to fit your team's needs and
that means that if you want to break or
if you want to go from a warning to an
error then it allows you to go that so
you can see here the severity set the
suggestion but you can change it to
error and then that will cause everybody
to actually go and fix their issues but
if I go back up I'll pick up something
that's very well debated and a heated
conversation so I go with tab and save
that saving thinking about it there you
go
so if I switch back to my code you'll
notice that right now I have 4 spaces
everywhere but if I do ctrl K and ctrl D
automatically applies the editor config
settings to my code that means that the
soon as you you add your ATAR config you
can go back and apply those settings to
your files which is fantastic that that
means that your team can have a
consistent code base there so I mean
just
don't save that one obviously let me
just go back and revert that because I'm
pretty sure my team will be upset about
the tubs space save that and again not
applies and I did say I did mention
about life sir so you've never used life
sir it's available on V video and visit
your code and you don't have to have the
exact same environment on the target
machine the one that you're sailing with
but you can go into live sir it's
already kicked off a stirring session I
don't have any one right now - sir with
but if I go into more info you'll not
study it says just copy this URL send
somebody else and with that they can
actually join your session and say
exactly what you see here which is
fantastic especially if you're in games
development you're new and you need
support and throughout the your coding
session so I'm just gonna stop that life
sir in case anybody wants to join and
I'll go back to some of the other things
I talked so let's see here what else do
we have and code lands we're building
source control yet let me just show you
this one
so we source control again it will
automatically pick up I was using get
locally here so you'll notice that
there's a lot of files that have changed
throughout my editing you can also use
an an exclude circuit ignore to exclude
some of the files because obviously you
don't want to take in everything and on
your source code and like in dark themes
with the settings if you didn't know you
can create custom settings as well so if
you want to have a very specific layout
for your games development you won't
ignore your debug you want to ignore
other things and that are not relevant
to you or Windows that are not like to
box then you can come here create your
session and your your layout and then
you can apply it I know where you're
these settings do carry with you as soon
as you log into business to do with your
account so if I were to change the web
layout you will ask me whether I want to
do that and then it does it there you go
it's very different right I want to go
back to my default one because I don't
like this one I save great one for a
guarantee obviously but it's fine so
I'll go back to
my default layouts go applying this one
fantastic anything I want to highlight
here and Intel Kota I will show you in a
bit
and now I will explain why real-time
analyzers we have Roslin if you know if
you don't know about Rosen you can
download and install Rosen analyzers the
ID also comes with some default
analyzers here as I type it might come
back with a suggestion saying you're
missing an underscore prefix or you
could make this field read-only so
straight away it actually tries to make
me a better developer by providing some
suggestions for my code and rows
analyzers are very powerful because they
run at real time as you type your code
so you don't have to again again save
and build before you find out that there
are some warnings against your your code
right moving on I want to highlight why
Visual Studio is so important with with
unity and why when you use them together
there they said your code on fire right
did you become a lot more efficient
obviously Intel code now has been
designed to work with most of the SES
our default projects but our team is
working to bring the unity API messages
into Intel code which means that we're
scanning our code bases out there to
make sure that we pick up the best
skills for your for your unity games and
Intel code goes one step above
intelligence because as I said earlier
on it's context sensitive it knows
exactly where you are and what you're
doing it will provide you with the best
ideas as you type and Visual Studio does
come with superior debugging we have the
ability to set up trace points and
breakpoints and really dig through the
code there have been already sessions
that so what vance tips and tricks on
how to debug using Visual Studio so I
would urge you to go and see these and
we also added a unity project Explorer
which makes your experience slightly
better so if I switch back to my visual
studio you'll notice that I don't have
it down here but if I search for unity
you'll notice it has unity API reference
and unity project Explorer so that
it gives you a more simplified version
or a look and feel of your files and
your assets so you don't have to go
through the standard solution Explorer
so we have an optimized experience for
you
I thought simply going back to the ID up
until this point we only had that ATS so
you had to spin up the game and so you
spin up the the video studio attached to
unity and they had to go back to the
unity editor and spin up the game and
then set break once here in order to be
able to attach but now lo and behold we
have attached the unity and play
straightaway so you will kick off your a
game end to end so if I were to try this
one
and we can also put a breakpoint over
here we'll kick off my awesome game it's
not it's not awesome but I did spend an
afternoon writing this game so I wanted
to prove to myself that as a.net
developer I can write something in unity
in and not a lot of time so within one
afternoon let's say four or five hours I
was able to put this thing together so
let's see if it's already kicked off the
breakpoint is there if I'll go to my
game trying to switch now maybe right
let me stop that one bring it back to
focus I think it's right something
something resolutions something okay so
that's my game it's a very basic game I
created a car and I put some obstacles
on the road and what I'm trying to do is
circumnavigate around them so I had no
knowledge of that
I've used some ready-made components so
unity makes it very easy to actually
create a whole world out of ready-made
assets so all you have to do literally
is write the experience or the behavior
around these objects and how you want
them to behave right now and before even
starting coding anything this these were
just Dom objects sitting on our scene so
what I did is I actually add user
controls to be able to navigate around
the car and then I wanted to to also add
the behavior of moving the camera behind
the car so it follows the car as it goes
through and later in the game or in my
talk we're gonna add one behavior which
is exploding crates
because there's no fun if there's no
explosion right so I wanted to make sure
that if you toss the crate it just
explodes so right now we're here you see
it actually has kicked off the game so I
can see ya think there you go
we can never get around the space it's
very basic I showed them to my daughters
and we're not very impressed because you
know they play xbox and then when I saw
them this I was really excited but the
excitement not really pan out with them
so as you can see I can already control
it and the code that I needed to write
to make this happen was literally a few
lines of code so in this instance we
have four lines of code that control the
forward and backward and the sideways
movements and then one more line of code
that actually allows us to control the
camera now I did speak about Intel akkad
and how it works for us so if I were to
do transform here and then do a dot
you'll notice that we do have position
local scale parent local position and
rotation
it's the Intel code here it tells us
that the code that you might want to use
this first because these are the most
common ones in the context of the update
so maybe you want to pick these ones up
rather than try to find through the API
as you can see it's a massive API here I
have no idea what I'm to do so Intel
occurred really helps me focus on the
things that really matter and the nice
thing about that is that if you go into
an if statement then it will actually
change the whole experience so let's say
if I go down here and say if and then
transform and dot you notice that it's
changed sadly so it gives us the route
which was not there before it also gives
us a child object so it looks for like
if transform has child objects you might
want to do something so intel code hones
in into those skill all those parts of
the API that do you make sense to you
right I did talk about Intel code yes
and one more thing about and Teleco
right we already have the automatic
Intel code which does a lot of things
out of the box for us but you can take
it one step further by train
in Teleco to apply specifically to your
codebase so if you search for Intel
akkad up here in Turley codes you notice
that there's a Intel code model
management and what this does is allows
you to submit your code to your Intel
code engine to create the model that you
need to apply to your machine and that
makes it very specific to your codebase
you can also share that with the rest of
the team and that makes everybody more
efficient so if you have a large code
base with a low of classes that you want
to be able to quickly bring to the
surface and Intelli code allows you to
do that and you also have a custom model
for unity to allow you to even be more
efficient right by ends up jumping back
into our unity the last thing I wanted
to do is obviously show you some of the
the good things in Visual Studio we do
have they're built in out to create C
sharp files sader files and in um files
directly in the unity project in the
Explorer faster project reloading so we
want to make sure that as you change
your code from unity then the project
reloads much faster especially if you
are the law of assets we want to have
reduced time for debugging so no not
many delays the team has really focused
on better performance we also want
support more unsafe code debugging
options and and we have unity specific
analyzers and diagnostics inside Visual
Studio to make you look better and have
better code and finally we're
suppressing non-applicable sis or
Diagnostics so with that I wanted to go
back to our game and just add the
explosion because as I said I promised
your explosion so we'll see some
explosions this time I'm going to go via
unity so here you'll notice I have an
obstacle and which are actually using to
create new lots of obstacles in our game
because we have about six of them it
does have any behavior or code so what
I'm going to do now is add a component
and in this instance we're going to add
some C sharp files so a new script we'll
call it collision detection because it's
actually colliding with something
collision helper there you go
can you script collision helper create
an ad so this will add it to our
obstacle now because everything else
in our code base inherits from that base
obstacle all I need to do now is go into
our where did that go
oh it's still loading right okay still
fixing it adding it there you go so the
collision helper here now that file is
here let's tidy up a little bit we won't
have a nice tidy solution and I'm going
to jump into my collision helper
this will open inside Visual Studio I'm
going to delete this ones because I
don't need them and I'm going to add my
snippet so what we're doing here very
basic it took me probably two hours to
figure it out for lives of code and
there you go what we're doing is we're
getting the game object we need to make
sure that it's only the vehicle that
collides with our without crate right
because if everything else collides then
we don't really need to know about that
then we grab the particle system that
actually throws the explosion we make
sure that we have a handle on that in
fact achieve use the curly brackets that
Matt stalked on the first day to check
whether it's null or not and then we
need to make sure there's no playing
right now and then kick off they're
destroyed so I'm going to kick off the
game now let's save this one and then
kick off the game blow something up and
then we can move into questions there
you go it's going to take a couple of
seconds and
explosion right that's it four lines of
code and you have an explosive crate
right last slide for me for today is all
about what you can do next so if you are
if you are keen on learning what you can
do next we just go and download Visual
Studio add the unity we recently
launched some amazing learning tutorials
with unity in collaboration so go there
we have more than six hours of learning
materials and then we also have a how to
build your first game our PM John Miller
wrote this one it goes through step by
step on how to use versity for mac and
build your own tic-tac-toe game so thank
you very much thank you very much for
joining me today

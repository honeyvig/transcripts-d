hi everyone welcome to the simplyland
youtube channel this session will be
about go programming language before we
begin if you love watching tech videos
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
in this session you will learn about
what kolang is next you will come across
the history of kolang and learn about
the uses and features of golem further
you will learn how to install golang on
your system after that we'll learn about
the variables data types operators
and
loops in golang and we'll be
implementing some examples in the visual
studio code at the final instance we
will learn about the companies using
golem let's start with what colang is
golang is a strong and statically typed
compiled language strong language
depicts that the type of variable cannot
change in a code it will remain the same
throughout the code
here statically type means that all the
variables must be declared at the
compile time and compile language states
that you only have to compile the code
and it will be converted to machine code
directly it is same as c or c plus plus
go doesn't have a virtual machine like
java language which takes time to
convert the script into machine language
golang is an open source programming
language and it supports concurrent
programming
that is it allows running multiple
processes simultaneously this is
achieved using channels go routines etc
these features help go to improve its
performance
and
and you can find documentation of golang
and golang.org
companies such as google twitch and uber
use go for their microservices
technologies like docker and kubernetes
are developed in the go language
now
we will learn about the history of
kolank
was designed at google in 2007 and was
announced to the public in 2009 and it
was made open source in 2012
with the release of version 1.0 the go
programming language was born due to the
complexity of managing the
infrastructure and code bases within
google
the language creators all from google
had a clear goal
to design a programming language that
would be easy to use but still be able
to cover the main challenges while
working with the company's intricate
systems
both designed by robert grismer rob pike
and ken thomson
the most remarkable release that is
polank version 1.5 was represented in
august 2015 and included considerable
changes the compiler tool chain has been
converted from c to go entirely and at
this stage golem took the form to which
it authors aspired let's learn about the
features of colon
the first feature is it is flexible
because of the language design and its
root from c language colang is easy to
learn and understand with simple syntax
that's why it's flexible the next is
concurrency
go allows multiple processes to run
simultaneously its ability to take
advantage of multi-core processor
architectures and efficient memory is
one of the reasons why co code is today
running some of the most heavily used
applications that can scale
the next is strong security component
code is safe and more secure than
complicated code as co is a statically
typed language go users don't have to
debug a load to identify
errors which is in the case with many
dynamic languages and a large number of
variable types plus the inclusion of a
garbage collector also helps prevent
memory leaks
the next is impressive standard library
go users have a standard library packed
with the language which reduces the
importing of complex secondary libraries
gold standard library is vast but not
confusing that is without the issue of
conflicting function names one of the
core's best contributions to programming
is it offers a more straightforward way
of integrating data structures into port
probes
the next feature we have is the fast
output go comes with a very quick
compilation type in the golang
development environment there is no
virtual machine the code is directly
compiled to machine code making the
compilation process faster and more
effective
besides the compiler produces only one
executable file after compilation this
file does not suffer from dependency and
can be uploaded and run anywhere this
makes the code execution process faster
now
now let's know about the uses of colang
go was originally built for programs
related to networking and infrastructure
that was intended to replace popular
high performance and server side
languages like java and c plus plus
golang's support for concurrency makes
it an excellent choice for handling
bottlenecks that prevent scalability
today
go is used for variety of applications
the first one is it is used in the world
of artificial intelligence and data
science
it is used in devops and site
reliability automation that is popular
way to use go some use go for
microcontroller programming robotics and
games
go is popular for cloud-based or
server-side applications
concurrency and networking features
lying with its high portability across
various platforms that makes q an
exceptional language for cloud computing
as a matter of fact
many standout cloud platforms like
kubernetes they were built in go google
cloud also uses core to enhance
scalability and performance
and many command line tools are written
in go however ghost shines the most when
it comes to infrastructure today some of
the most popular infrastructure tools
are written in go such as kubernetes
docker and prometheus now we'll go to
the official website of go
for that we'll move to google chrome
in the search bar
the first link that is code dev
will open this link
you can see this is the official website
of go
you can see the mass code of bowling
like this is the creature
and scrolling down we can see the
companies using golem google paypal
american express netflix salesforce
dropbox cloudflare
and many more
and as we scroll down we can see
this is the playground idli that is
available on the
golang website
here we can print hello world
we'll just click on the run
you can see that it has printed the
hello world and the program has been
existed
ideally that is available on the cooling
website it just run the script to the
server for compilation and gives the
output
now we will move on to download the
golang
for that we will click on this button
that is the download button
you can see the various options that is
for microsoft windows mac os linux
and the source go link file so we have
the windows system we will download it
for windows
online is a minimalistic language and
it has a very little documentation so it
is
easy to learn as it has fewer features
and less confusing parts than java
let's see
the documentation
see the whole documentation here
so golang file is downloaded just click
on it
and install it on your windows system
as i have already installed so it's not
showing me the setup without option to
install it
and after installing the go link you
have to install
an idle to run the go language i have
installed the visual studio code
you can install any ideally that you
prefer
i will show you how to enable go in
visual studio code
for that
search
studio pod
go to the extension section
and search for go here i have search for
the go and press enter you'll see the
first option
that is go
just enable it i have already enabled it
and you are ready to use go in the
visual studio code
now
we'll move
to learn some other features of golang
that is variables in golem
a variable is a storage area defined to
store temporary data and perform
operations on them moreover variable
values can further be changed according
to program needs
variables declared without any
corresponding value are considered zero
value
there are two ways to declare variables
in golem first is using where keyword
that is its syntax is
simply the where keyword and writing the
variable name and then the type and then
the data you want to store in that
the next is the short variable
declaration
first you will write the variable name
and then colon equal to sign and the
data you want to store in that
so now let's move to vs code and see the
declaration of variables live
open a new file and see
the declaration so
the new file and we name it as demo.com
here we will be using the terminal
to run all the codes of go language
now the first thing we will do is import
fmt
and we put it in inverted commas
this is the formatting package and it
contains a print function
everything in the go is inside packages
whether it is a print function or any
other function we have to use packages
by using import writing the package name
in inverted commas
if someone wants to use your script or
your code he can by importing your go
file or your go package so it becomes
mandatory and go to put the code in a
package
here we will put a code under the main
package
so we'll write
package
main
now we will write our code in the main
function for that we'll write function
main
now
we will assign the variables that is
variable i
of type end
and
find another variable
variable r
of type string
declare the values
for it we will declare
number seven
and for r
with simply learn
print these values for that
we'll use the fmt package
we'll write fmt dot println
and in the circle brackets we will write
the name of the variable that is i
and in the next line we will print
another variable
that is our
println
in the circle brackets we will write the
variable name r
and now we'll save the file
by
clicking on ctrl s and now in the
terminal
to run the file i will write the command
go
run and the name of the file that is
demo
dot go
and press enter
now you can see
that
we have printed seven and simply learn
and both in the different lines
it was not visible
now it should be visible
now moving on
we will declare another variable
would
be j
colon equal to 15
and i'll
also print this
save the file
and in the terminal run the same command
that is score and demo.
now you can see that it has 27 simply
learn n15 so we have seen
both the types how to declare a variable
that is short variable method
and the simple where keyword method
now will move to the next type that is
data types in golang
two data types specify the type and
space allotted to variables or functions
mainly there are four categories of data
types in golem that is boolean type
numeric type string type and derived
type
boolean type represents a boolean value
that is either true or false and is
represented by one or zero
the next is numeric type it represents
integer types floating point values and
complex types here we can see the
integer type values that is two five
seven eight
the next is string type
the string type represents a string
value
here we can see that's simply learned
it's a string and it's represented by a
string type the next is derived type
these include array types structure
types and many more we'll use them in
further tutorials
let's see an example
uh we'll see the example for the boolean
type
so we will create another file
that would be
demo one dot go
and
here first we will start with package
main
and
inside package
will import the fmt package that would
be inside the curly braces
and now
we'll start with function main
and inside the curly braces
first we'll declare a variable that
would be a
and using the short variable method
we will assign the value simply learn
and we will declare another variable
that would be b
and assign the value
that is simply learn
another variable that is c
and assign the value
that is
now we will compare these strings
and store it in result variable
now we'll compare both the strings uh
first we'll compare a with b
and see whether a is equal to b or node
that is we will see the boolean return
type
that both the strings are equal or not
or are the same or not
for that we will write a equal equal to
b
now we will
print the result
save the file
and in the terminal write the command go
run
demo one dot go and press enter
okay now let's see declared but not used
so
we will use c also
for that we will declare another
variable that is result one
that a is equal to equal to c or not
print
the result one
i will save the file
and run the command
go run demo1.com
here you can see that
it has given the output false and true
the first one is false that is a equal
to equal to b
so simply learn is not equal to simplyn
as it has the lowercase letter
and in the second that is a result one
it has given us true as both
the strings are equal that is
both are in the upper case the first
letter is in the upper case
now we'll see another concept in golang
that is operators
an operator is a specified operation
that is performed on the operands
the following list describes the
different operators used in golem first
is arithmetic operator it includes
addition subtraction multiplication
division and modulus operator the next
is relational operators it includes
equal to not equal to greater than less
than greater than equal to and less than
equal to
the next is logical operators it
includes
logical and logical ore and logical node
operator they are used to combine two or
more conditions the next we have is
bitwise operators in go language there
are six bitwise operators which work at
bit level or used to perform bit by bit
operations
that are bitwise and bitwise or bitwise
or
left shift or right shift the next we
have is assignment operators the
assignment operators are used to assign
values to variables that is
plus equal to minus equal to
multiplication equal to
so now we will see some examples
to understand the operators
i will create a new file
that would be
demo2
dot go
and first we'll start with arithmetic
operators
so that will
write package main
import
fmt
oh
i didn't put the space here
yeah import fmt now start with function
main
inside function first we'll declare the
variables
we'll declare p
equal to
65
and a
equal to 34.
now first we will do the addition
that will declare variable result
and inside result we will perform the
operation
p plus a
and now we'll
print the result
so that we will write the statement fmt
dot
println
and the variable name that is
result now we'll save the file
and run the command in the terminal
that is
go run
demo2 dot co
and press enter
you can see that it has given us the
output 99 that is the addition of pna
now we will see another operator that
would be modulus operator
for that
we will declare another variable that
would be
result one
would be p
modulus a
now we will
print the result of
print this result one
variable
could be fmt dot
print ln
and inside the circle brackets we'll
write
result one variable
and save the file
and run the same command in the terminal
i will go 31 as the modulus
as we have seen the example of
arithmetic operator now we will see the
example of relational operator
for that
uh we will perform the example on not
equal to operator
so that we will
declare a variable result 2
and
whether p
is not equal to a
and now we will
print this variable
save the file
and then the same command in the
terminal
as you can see it's true that
p is not equal to a we have seen the
example of relational operator now we'll
move on to logical operator
with that will create a new file
demo three dot
go and
start with the package main
and import fmt package
and inside the function main
first will declare the variables
a
b
and assign values to them
2
4
8.
now
we will
print the statement from d note
println
and inside
we perform the operation
sorry that is
a less than b
operator
logical end
and a
greater than c
and will perform another operation
that would be fmt dot
println
sorry
println and inside you'll perform a less
than b
or operator
and a
greater than c
save the file
and
run the command in the terminal
go run demo 3.0
to see the command
now you will be able to see the command
3.0
it has printed
the output false and true
here b is greater than a that is 4 is
greater than 2 and
a is greater than c
that is false 2 is not greater than 8 so
it has printed false and in the second
b is greater than a it's true and a is
greater than c it's false
so true or
false it gives out true
so moving on to the next operator that
is bitwise operator
clear all this
just in the function main
variable
equal to
79 and
equal to 87
and perform the bitwise operator on this
so
we'll declare a variable result one
form the operation that would be a
bit wise
and
save the file and run the command in the
terminal
you can see that bitwise and has given
us
71 output
now moving on we'll use some assignment
operators
for that
we have two variables declared
and the assignment
we'll use the first assignment operator
that will be equal to one
so we'll just do a equal to
get it printed
save the file and run the command in the
terminal
we can see
that
we can see the output as 87 so a has
been assigned the value of b that is 87
now i will perform another operation
that would be plus equal to
so now a also has the same value as b
that is 87 so we perform the operation
a plus equal to
plus equal to
b
we will print a only
save the file and now we will run on the
terminal
has given us the output as 174.
so now we have seen the assignment
operators also
now we see
another concept that is loops in calling
loop is the repetition of a block of
code that executes a control statement
specific number of times
co language works with a single loop
that is for loop
go language uses for loops on various
forms such as infinite loops for loop as
while loop and using for loops for
strings and maps we'll see and
understand this with the help of
demonstration let's move to visual
studio code
a new file that would be loops dot go
start with package main
import
fmt
and inside the function main
you will see the example to print
numbers from 1 to 10.
for that we'll start with the loop
four
that is the i
with one
semicolon
i less than equal to
n
i plus plus
and inside the loop we will print fmt
dot
println
i
just save the file
and in the terminal run the command
go run and the name of file was loo dot
co
do not
find the file specified
oh sorry the file name is do stored
over run
lose dot co
here we can see that it has printed the
numbers from one to ten
now we'll use the for loop as well loop
so for that
we'll clear the for loop and we will
print the same the numbers from 1 to 10
and for that
first we will initialize
num
equal to 1
and now we will use the for loop
and equal to 10
and inside this 4 as a while loop we
will print
fmt dot
println
and this
will
make it as num plus plus
now we will save the file
and run the command in the terminal
here you can see that we have put the
output one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten
so this is how we use for loop as while
loop in golem
now
we have seen loops now we will see some
other examples such as printing
fibonacci series
so that will create a new file
that would be
5.4
for that we'll start with package main
we'll import
fmt
now we will declare a function
and input an integer to it
to which extent we should print the
fibonacci series
so
we'll declare a function we'll write the
keyword func and the name of the
function that would be fib
and inside we'll pass a variable num of
the type int
and inside the function
we would declare
a equal to 0
e equal to 1
and c
equal to b
and
we will print
a and b here
for that
we'll write the command
fmt dot
printf
right right
flip series
is
sending
personally
now
use for loop as a while loop and
while it's true
c equal to b
and b
equal to a plus
b
if
b is greater than equal to num
enter line
fmt dot
println
break the loop
equal to c
sorry break the if statement
equal to c and print b
that is from t dot
printf
present d
b
now we'll call the clip function in the
function main
16
so it will print 16 digits of fibonacci
series
we will save the file
and in the terminal will run the command
web dot co
just check yeah the name is fib
and press enter
here we go to fib series that is
now we will see another demonstration
that would be of printing table
for that will create another file that
would be table.go
and for that we'll start with package
main
and
import fmt package
and inside the function main
first we will declare a variable
n of type end
and we will get the input
for which table we want to print the
table
from the user for that will write the
command fmt
dot scan
ampersand
now
we'll initialize a variable from one
and use the for loop as while loop
that
right for
and inside for loop we'll write f
is greater than 10
the statement
should break and come out of the
if statement
and print
affirmative dot
println
multiplication symbol
with
i
that would be equal to
and into i
outside we will do i plus plus
now let's save the program
and run it in the
terminal
that would be current table.com
input seven
and here we go to the table of seven
now we have done with the demonstrations
now we have done with the demonstrations
now we will see some companies using
golang in their product
first one is twitch it is a live video
streaming platform that uses go for many
busiest systems
the next is uber micro services it's a
ride-hailing platform that uses go
within its microservices
the next is kubernetes
it's an open source container or
castration system used to automate
software deployment scaling and
management google designed kubernetes
but the cloud native computing
foundation currently maintains its
next is dropbox it is a file hosting
service that has migrated some major
components from python to go
the next is netflix it is the most
popular rotated platform and has used
core to develop its server architecture
with that we have come to the end of

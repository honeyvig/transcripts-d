(upbeat music)
- [Brad Voiceover] It's lunch time
and this is Brad Anderson's Lunch Break.
Here in Redmond, we're visited by some of
the smartest people on the planet
pretty much every day.
Every chance I get,
I meet up with them for lunch.
In today's episode, I meet up with a CTO
by which all other CTOs are judged,
Rhonda Vetere from Estee Lauder.
(calm music)
So you leave this huge,
worldwide organization
- [Rhonda] Yes.
- You go to all these
great places, you know
and then in your left over
time, you run marathons
and Ironman triathlons.
Like what do you not do?
- We have to maintain our health, right?
If you can't take care of yourself,
who are you gonna take care of in leading?
- So your organization
spends a lot of time
modernizing, you know,
your infrastructure.
- Yes.
- What are the factors,
internal and external,
that lead you to do all the
things that you've done?
- The factors were it was the right time,
the whole world is changing
to going to the cloud and making sure
we're doing the right thing,
and not spending a bunch of
money that goes to the wayside.
That's one thing that
keeps me up at night.
I don't want to spend a bunch of money
that you're obsolete right away.
And, absolutely, from a
talent perspective, it helps.
- That's a good point.
So tell me about that.
From a talent perspective,
how does that help you
to recruit in the strongest team
if you're on the cutting edge
of, like, this move to the cloud
and this digital transformation.
- People love it.
Digital is a big buzzword,
just like the cloud was.
Some people are scared
about this buzzword,
but it's a huge recruitment.
IT, I would say, was usually
in the back office of the basement.
Hopefully, one of my jobs,
I fully believe, driving
business outcomes,
you can make IT fun.
I wanna make technology back to being fun
and pretty--
- I wanna work for you.
- And beautiful, just
like Estee Lauder company.
So I just want to make sure.
It's great to be that, and
recruiting, you can do it.
I want to be that, that you can lead
from the chair and do it.
- So the founder of your
company, Estee Lauder,
she was in a profile about 20 years ago
about the 20 most influential
business leaders of the century,
but she was the only woman on the list.
- Yes.
- Okay, we've come a long way,
I think, in those 20 years,
but we need to do, we have
to do a lot better than that.
So what do you think we can
do differently and better
so the next time we see that list,
we see people like Andrea Neri,
and Ginni Rometty from IBM
or Meg Whitman.
How do we make sure that
half of that list, at least,
is women next time?
- That's an interesting point.
I think from the industry
and known from the results perspective,
to making sure that they are
promoted within that group.
Top lists come out all the time.
But we as a world need
to look at that too,
and promote that, women supporting women.
Quite frankly, on top of that,
is more what we need in this world.
- And men supporting women as well, yeah.
Every time I go out to
give a keynote, right,
there's always people back stage
that have got to put the makeup on,
get the shine off my head, right?
And so, can I ask something honestly here?
- Sure, anything.
- Am I wearing too much makeup today?
- You look fabulous.
(laughter)
You look natural.
You are totally natural,
you are in your element.
(laughter)
- So how can an IT
leader pull that trigger
if they're hesitant to
actually take that place
at the table and lead that
digital transformation?
- That's a great question.
We take risks about changing
the culture, the dynamics.
And having the courage to
say this isn't working.
This is where we need to go.
It's all about results,
measuring it, monitoring it.
What's the value?
What's the productivity?
And pushing that message,
and as a leader you have to
push it and believe in it
and lead your team through it.
It's not just a one stop shop.
(jaunty music)
- Next time on Brad Anderson's Lunch Break
What did you take away
from those experiences?
- Being relevant, and that you
can become obsolete overnight
and not realize it, no
matter what field you are in.
- All too often, people
are afraid to say no,
and most times, you know,
who you're talking to,
they just want to know what the answer is,
and no is okay,
but it takes courage.
And for many people,
that's a courage that has to be developed.

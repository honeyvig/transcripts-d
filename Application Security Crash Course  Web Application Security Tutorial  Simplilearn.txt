the pin comment so without any further
Ado let's get started starting with the
introduction before that let's have a
little course
introduction so we'll be uh doing an INT
ruction to application security what is
application
security where it is used so as the name
says application security includes all
tasks that introduce a security software
development life cycle development teams
its goal is to improve security
practices and find fix and prevent
security issues within applications how
it is done why it is done that we will
learn along the journey along with
practical
examples application security
is not confined to a certain area it's
not confined to it as it seems that it's
it might be uh confined to IT industry
only but no uh you might have heard
about attacks uh cyber security attacks
on government institutes energy and U
utilities Healthcare institutes banking
institutes so yes it impacts application
security impacts all of these
sectors how they impact we will be
seeing it while the journey is going on
our course would start with the
introduction which we are doing then the
Core Concepts what's software security
how secure software testing is done what
is cryptography a very important topic
and secure software life cycle
management skills that we'll be covering
would be web app scanning and crypt
application monitoring error logging
oasp top 10 and API security the agenda
for
today web app
Security application and web app
security all right so what are the
learning objectives for today again the
basics Core Concepts of
security we'll be able
to classify the best practices
we will be analyzing one case
study that would be of uber we will see
what went wrong or what went good how
application web application security
would have done it better and we will
categorize the
requirements for a foolproof
security team what are the requirements
we'll be seeing it so say if you have
joined any organization as a cyber
security
specialist where would this course help
you see you you are given the following
tasks which you'll be able to do after
this
session
understand the vulnerability
stack what are vulnerabilities how they
are
classified which application is impacted
where to see which
vulnerabilities uh where on the net they
are visible is there any database for
vulnerabilities how many of the these
are there what about the vulnerabilities
which were there in the history can we
find them we will be able to
understand the
organizations security
policy so whatever organization you are
working in currently you will be able to
understand their security
policy then you'll be able to
review the core security
requirements whenever we talk about any
software so we talk about a
software we know it is something that we
use in our daily to day today life
uh it is a firmware with which we access
applications what is secure software now
the same software or same application is
secured by means
of following attributes which
attributes
reliability resiliency
recoverability when I talk about
reliability as the name says that is the
software
Dependable it fulfills the purpose for
which it was
created for example if I talk about
social uh networking sites the social
networking softwares so we know we at
once our mind will
okay you are talking about soft social
connection softwares so it's either
WhatsApp Facebook Instagram so these
companies or these softwares have made a
reliability mind setup so whenever we
talk about social engineering these
softwares would revolve in our
mind when we talk about
resiliency resiliency me
means that the software does not viate
any security
policy
so it's able to withstand the actions of
threat agents resiliency means I
downloaded the software today and
tomorrow it's demanding ransomware to
use my files are encrypted it's saying
that you cannot move forward from this
point so resiliency should be the here
it does not violate
[Music]
any any security
policy re reliability was the software
is
Dependable
recoverability as the name says so if I
remove any of the application from my
phone
uh I have some restore point or backup
point from where I will get the
entire think
back in same setup without any loss of
data
so software is able
to restore
operations when you buy a new
phone you simply have to login into your
ID which is mage it is if it is Android
you have to use your Gmail ID and entire
backup of applications from your
previous phone to your new phone it
clones it so that talks about the
recoverability after software or secure
software we talk about web
applications what are web
applications these are nothing but
software programs that run on web
browsers if I open uh say any website
simply
learn what is
this this is a web application which is
running in my browser so anything any
application or any software which runs
on browser which runs on web is web
application
talking about the flow let's talk
about the flow how the data
flows I'll be
using
different symbols
here so let's
say this is my database
server or I call it
DB this is my application
server this one is the web
server so all these things combined
together they work in background so
these would be the backend
thing all three of these
are backend
when I talk about the applications if
I'm seeing this so this all is in front
end because it's directly on UI on which
I'm interacting with
it so front end would
be this would be
my web
browser and the system on which it is
running
laptop or
mobile whatever device it
is so I I won't be using Cloud here but
yes this is front
end how would be the flow move my
database server will
fetch the address I searched for simply
learn application server will respond
that yes this is simply learn
application it
will the application server will respond
and the web server will then be showing
this to web
browser so now simply learn is visible
on web browser and
that is reflected on
my device which is either laptop or
mobile and this thing is fronted so just
an overview how web applications
work which main components are in action
starting from database server in which
entire uh
applications entire simply learn things
are hosted application server on which
the application is
hosted web
server responding on web browser to your
laptop or mobile
application vulnerability
stack if we talk about
application vulnerability stack or
AVS as the name
says it will talk about
application irrespective it is web
application mobile
application Cloud
application any vulnerability that is
impact impacting this
application would be a part of
application vulnerability
stack so when you talk about
vulnerability what is
vulnerability anyone want to answer it
uh I won't be judging over it but yes uh
just to see how many of
you can answer what is a
vulnerability if I say
uh any application say if I say I won't
be naming any other application if I say
simply learn application is having some
vulnerability what does that
means does mobile app also require web
server in the back
end how is web server different from web
browser all right so I'll firstly answer
these two questions from vhan and VV so
Wan says how is web different from web
browser we done web server is on which
the application is hosted which is in
the back end from where my web browser
which is Chrome it is fetching that
detail from some web browser on which
simply learn is hosted
so answering your question web browser
is
either
Chrome uh the one which is obsolete
Internet Explorer which is now not used
in its place we
have Microsoft
Explorer
Firefox so Opera Mini so all these are
web browsers
while web servers
are
Apache Apache web server we have some
web servers from Oracle Microsoft has
its own web servers Google has its web
servers AWS has its web
servers so that's the difference between
web server and web
browser does mobile app also require web
server in the backend uh vev yes the
answer is if because you also use web
browsers on your mobiles so if you're
using uh browser say you want to see
your report card and you want to access
uh the website of your University or
college if you are using your mobile
browser you again are accessing
their web server in the back
end pradep says web application and
website what is the major difference uh
both of them work on www
so web site and web application both
works on our browser
in Android Studio we use web view which
is like a server uh that's true
veran vulnerability is the thing which
happens integrity and availability for
data so that that shows that uh you have
been good in the module one because
that's from where you are answering it
that's good all right answer to this in
two different scenarios one scenario the
one I discussed uh where you are using
mobile application say which is mobile
Chrome which is Chrome or Firefox inside
your mobile now it is the mobile
application it runs on web servers uh
Edge again these are mobile applications
and they do have we servers on which
they will show you the
answers because they are browsers so yes
they have servers in the background
talking about other applications uh
although this answers your
question google.com is a
website yes yes it uh Google ultimately
uses servers database server google.com
when you search
so searching here although it is my
default page but yes google.com it is
talking to its server in the back
end and showing me this this page so
this page is web page of Google or
website of Google so now you got your
answer web application would be if
you're using that Google application in
your phone that's the
application while anything which you see
on web browser is a website web app
server mobile app server do they run on
same server that depends upon company to
company if I'm having a big company like
Google or Microsoft I'll have different
servers so that if my web app is down my
mobile app is running it doesn't impact
it while uh if I'm a a small cap company
or medium cap company I might have both
on same physical server of same Cloud
Server so I might use AWS with different
instances running for mobile and web app
or I might have even if I'm smaller than
that with low budget I be having single
physical server with both of them
running on it so depending upon the
budget I having we were talking about
stack when we talk about stack let's
start from the network
part when we talk about networks what
are the things that are under
attack we either talk about routers or
firewalls
when we talk about operating
systems and these all are the things
that you need to know to be successful
in cyber security domain knowledge of
each one of
these applications would either
be either be open
source or licensed which are commercial
database when you talk about DB there
are certain database that run in the
background we have
Oracle
MySQL
[Music]
db2 and so on the list goes on but these
are the major on which the attacks
are
targeted what are the
components web
server either
Apache
Microsoft
IAS custom web
application what issues do we see in
custom web app applications this
generally happens when uh there is an
application already placed there uh
there's a mark uh application working
and its source code is available uh say
in
gitlab so when you talk about it's
source code is there in gitlab you try
to customize it according to your wish
say Uber uh is there already placed in
gitlab the code is there I make some
changes according to my requirement
and uh generate a new taxi application
with some name say my name is her so let
Let It Be Herre cabs or blue cabs Yellow
Cabs whatever
so I'm
using Code which is already there but
now I have made it customized according
to my needs
we can have business logic
flows
or we can have technical vulnerabilities
if I'm not into uh security thing I
might change something which could
induce a vulnerability in that
application in that customized
application not the original one because
I'm now playing with it so I might
induce some technical ability in it with
with the changes I'm trying to do but
again that that depends upon what kind
of service you are taking from the cloud
provider if the security is managed by
them then you don't have to fear
anything if anything happens your data
is lost the cloud providers would
compensate you but that typically never
happens does web scrapping comes in
to strapping comes into this issue as we
try to extract info without permission
of the company uh if you
notice uh when I'm trying to answer your
questions I'm revolving around simply
learn only due to same uh thing what you
are trying to question veran uh yes uh
when you try to say even even when we
will be attacking
uh websites it would be mostly simply
learn only because we won't be attacking
any other website of any other company
that could lead us in trouble or jail so
yes that's a very good
question if you try to fingerprint we
call it fingerprinting or
footprinting uh when you try to collect
data of any website or any company
through these means their sock team
their security team would come to know
that something is something fish is
happening and yes that might lead you in
trouble so permission of company is
necessary in most of the
cases all right
next point
is single page
applications as the name
says applications which run on a single
page
they they are called single page
applications how they
work
uh say it's it's it's a design approach
that generates web pages dynamically
with new data from the web server
instead of loading entire new
pages
so every time you open single page
application D it autog generates the
data from web server and it uh
doesn't always go back to web server for
fresh
linkages uh which could impact in its
loading so for faster loading Spa
generally uses ax to exchange data with
the server and JavaScript to manipulate
the elements on the existing
page so what does do it use Spa
uses Ed
X why to
exchange
data with
server what else
is
use
JavaScript to
manipulate the
objects now uh how can I know that
what elements are there on any website
so let me show
you
so talking about single page application
this is simply learn I want to know uh
what things what are the back end things
working on this page I either I go to
inspect element and uh use inspect
element to go one by one or I use some
bookmarks The Bookmark I will be using
would be Vaper and
shown talking about
weizer it
shows that simply learn is using
Microsoft
advertising for performance priority
hints for marketing automation they are
using web engage sales
Loft Amazon Cloud front is is the WAP
which is
CDN personal personalization is done on
web engage version
six so they are using pass platform as a
service so simply learn is hosted on web
application uh Amazon web services now
you know from
where it's fetching the data from the
analytics they using Facebook pixel
Google analytics Microsoft clarity
loadable components
jQuery
cryptojs so it these are the Javas
JavaScript
libraries if you want more click on more
info I guess it would be paid yes it's
paid you can export this entire
information if you
want you can use same thing for other
application the
other application or extension that I'll
be using is Shodan it
shows so I didn't know the IP address
from weizer so Shodan showed me that
okay this is
the IP address of Simply
learn it's on cloud we know that it is
AWS open ports are 80 and 443 uh in
network you will be I'm not YES Network
you have already done Enterprise
infrastructure so you know open puts 80
is for HTTP 443 is for
https so you can view IP details view
domain
details moving ahead it will show you
more details I'm not sure if it is paid
now no it is
not so it's on
Amazon it's the ISP
using Cloud
front Port 0 which is HTTP
https so these datas you can get from
some extensions if you are good at
coding that is always a plus point
because uh in web application sec there
are two types of testing one is static
analysis and the other is dynamic
analysis when we are doing static
analysis static analysis is nothing but
source code review you review the codes
for that you should be good in coding
while if you're doing Dynamic testing
that means websites in motion for those
you you just need know how of coding and
not the entire code structure so better
if you are
having uh Java or python
knowledge if don't know coding that much
if you are a fresher then you can learn
it by heart that would help you uh in
long run but if uh your job your current
job doesn't require it so you may even
not go along with it I'm currently okay
you are in network side so I started uh
with networks
only uh I started with networks then uh
wireless networks data networks wireless
networks and now I'm in cyber security
it it doesn't necessarily require you to
know the
website uh the programming but yes it
could help
you all right brief on it
okay so ax is a it is a set of web
development techniques uh when I'm using
edx on my client site on my system it's
used to create asynchronous web
applications so we can send and receive
data from server without interfering
with the display and behavior of
existing page even though uh this is
working on your uh we are using using
the chat within this application it is
not impacting any other functionality
while we are doing this session so this
is Ajax we are using Ajax it is just
utilizing a bit of the entire thing
without impacting anything that Dynamic
thing is called
ax so it is not changing behavior of the
existing page but we are still able to
check any example of spa if
possible
single uh this one example is the zoom
learning that we are doing uh we are
using meeting chat without impacting any
other thing in simply learn uh this
application is again Spa when I search
anything random it will provide me the
answer although I know harit is nowhere
inside it it will just throw an error
without without impacting anything else
on the
page so your search did not match any
content it take it took a second or so
so without impacting this it's Spa using
ax after single page
application all right let's talk more
about a bit more
about how single page application works
let's see
I don't want to save it all
right so
again this is my
browser this is my
server this is my
application this is the
response so my browser will send
request what it is doing it is sending a
request server will respond
with HTML
file that okay this is in response to
your request let this the
file now the application sends an aex
request to fetch data from the server
just keep
correlating you open your Google Chrome
you searched for see simply
learn server provided HTML file at
first then the
application
sends ax request
why it is sent to fetch data from the
server so now it is just sending ax so
that additional data from server is
requested without any impact on this
page which is already showing on
browser the final step would
be web page is
updated
using Json data
so Json data is received which is then
updated on
your web browser so this is how it is
functioning in the
background of a single page
application is payment system with UPI
also Spa because once we reach to
payment page then it sends a request to
up and keeps polling if we have made the
payment or not
so
uh there's another thing running in UPI
systems because there it
works uh two ways once it is uh
interacting with a server which checks
that if payment is made another it is
interacting with the server which checks
if you have provided the proper mpin or
OTP third it is interact with your bank
from which the payment has been made so
it's a little different uh it's not
entirely Spa but combination of Spas at
three different
levels all these three levels that I
talked is server and application
generating running on same system or
different is server and application
generating edx running on same system or
different since I'm using this web
browser simply Lear wants to to talk
with me but I don't so if I'm
using this website on my local machine
that means ax is running on this client
system so this answers your question
that ax works on the same system on
which the web browser or web app is
running Json how it works
Json is a message that that
you get say if you
are all right so if any response you are
getting in Json format you can simply
use uh Json
viewer uh I don't have Json sample
currently but let me see if I can get it
from
somewhere okay so
say if this is the Json data that we are
getting simply use it in
viewer it will show you data in this
format in tabular format that okay the
employee name is this salary is this and
it's he or she is Merit so this was the
code Jason VI were simplified it
in a tab
form so if this helps you in your daily
work what are the most common commonly
used Frameworks for developing Spas so
all these Frameworks that we are talking
you might have heard about it especially
if someone of you is a
developer
reactjs which is
Javascript view Js
Angular
JS so all these Frameworks are used for
developing Spas because Spa is a front
end technology there therefore all these
are the frontend utilities that we are
using so all right uh give me if you
could just to check kindly provide me
example of Spa uh in your from your
daily
life from your daily
life provide me an example of
spa very easy even if
[Music]
you that that's that's the uh that's the
definition of spa but uh provide an
example all right one example is
Facebook you edit change anything you
see video use but it
doesn't change the basic
functioning what
else share prices display if it is a
good application then
yes
okay otherwise if it is lagging then it
is not
ASP Gmail right Google Drive Right
WhatsApp WhatsApp
web okay the answer Twitter
perfect the answer which I am searching
for
SharePoint okay all right can say
because real time changes are there okay
perfect the answer which I wanted
to Google
Maps uh no because we are not changing
anything over
it uh okay
uh the answer which I was expecting from
you
people otd platform which is
Netflix yes venkatesh uh location can be
changed dynamically but during that time
uh once your location start and stop is
set it doesn't have
to fetch anything uh anything new uh
since you are connecting to internet
so that's that's what it requires that's
the ultimate thing it
requires talking about otd
platform uh yes Gio uh Netflix Amazon
Prime all these hundreds of people if if
there's uh match of Indian cricket team
uh hot star yes so it CS load of a
billion people billion devices
connecting to it and still it is working
without going down or showing any
symptoms of uh of disconnection so
that's that's where
Spas come into existence you are even uh
some someone who is not keen into uh
cricket they are working they are
watching some other thing over the same
application which might uh have some
different load level so cering to
different loads at same time YouTube yes
yes so all these are
Spas all right one question I saw
currently is what is the difference
between single page and multi-page
applications uh okay madri says should
shows TLS 1.2 for security is this not a
risk the latest is 1.3 very good
question badri but uh sometimes it's the
compatibility issues
say the company in which I currently
working they are also using TLS 1.2
because maximum of the infra inside the
company they support TLS 1.2 they
haven't shifted to 1.3 due to
compatibility issues of support so
that's why some companies are still
working on DLS 1.2 rather than 1.3 but
yet yes they do have the security team
working behind keep check which is
checking it regularly that nothing of
that sort happen uh any vulnerability
which is there for 1.2 they not
exploited by
anyone uh was uh that is also secure but
every version every latest version is
more secure than the earlier one DLS 1.1
transformed into 1.2 due to more
security the version 1.3 is more secure
but it's not very compatible to the
infrastructures
yet 1.2 is widely used so chanit the
answer Sunil attempted the answer and it
he is pretty much right single page
application will interact for any new
changes from the web server it will not
uh load the entire page again and again
while multi-page applications
will for any change they will reload the
entire application so they are more slow
than single page
applications if that answers
yes uh badri answered that also it is
new page every time with user
actions CRM is multipage application
true I guess this uh you are talking
about the sap CRM
right are we having hybrid uh where
where
uh where are we having hybrid I I mean
I'm not
getting the question Yahoo Gmail is
single
page they do not reload on receiving a
new mail they just keep new mail
updated I mean both SP spa and
MPA if people prefer multipage
application uh they are uh preferred
while using heavy applications so for
Spas are preferred for heavy
applications just as we discussed about
the OT things again the budget thing if
you don't have much budget you use
multipage application MPA example would
be anything uh say I'm not sure how many
of you have used medium which is a blog
site technical blog site so if you talk
about medium it is MPA any blog any
e-commerce website which is Amazon flip
cart
which goes to a new page if you go to
Amazon regular it is one page go to
Amazon Fresh yes s answered zato swii
these are all
mpas Wikipedia is MPA very nice example
of it are we having hybrid solution
between single page and multi-page
applications uh no
no uh no issues
uh uh if and application is Spa it is
completely Spa if an application is MPA
it is completely MPA we cannot have a
part of it as spa and a part of MPA
because that part itself is divided into
multiple pages so if it is MP it is
completely MP if it is sp
completely all right just one question
which one is faster spa
or soan that is Spa no doubt about
it Amazon Prime and Amazon mini all of
MSP so you all know Spa is
faster okay we know that the advantages
of using Spa is it is paid most of
resources loaded only
once uh data is preserved we require
less data what are the disadvantages of
using
Spa whenever you click on that minv
thing it will redirect you to Spa rather
than the MP part what about desktop
application which
application we we are talked about spa
and uh MP already which application
which desktop application you are
talking about again that depends which
application you're using if you're using
anun uh if you're using team viewer
those are those come
under mpas if you are using Netflix uh
application desktop application then
again it's
Spa navigation is maybe the issue with
Spa sir uh no okay what in navigation
you are not exact on the point but yes
near about loading uh akib it it is
faster so loading is not an issue for
spa loading is an issue for mpa what are
the disadvantages of using Spa
applications since it is faster in
execution which do you think is more
prone to attacks is it SP or MP no there
are dis advantages answer Sunil has
already answered it
so the there are kind of attacks uh
injection attacks accss attacks which
we'll be seeing in uh
further uh when is it is not the exact
thing but yes while while navigation
while in uh the data is in trans that
there's there's scope of attacks because
uh not the entire thing is reloading not
the entire data is being fed but only uh
the data which is being transmitted can
be manipulated by
attackers they can simply inject
malicious scripts into
it so there was uh there
was there was recent attack which was
called that was a vulnerability in
JavaScript Java which is called log 4J
if anyone of you remember that
4J this was a
vulnerability which was there in every
Java it was a zero day
vulnerability every Java logging
framework was having it so whenever we
talk about vulnerability and it it
attacked any and every application which
was working on JavaScript so this is one
of
the
uh example
where how it got vulnerability how it
got vulnerable okay uh long story short
uh JavaScript was
having some a single line in the code
which was talking about the logging
thing a little change in
that line or that code or that script
made it vulnerable to changes in entire
Globe wherever Java was being used uh so
that resulted in this vulnerability
which was already present there but was
never
exploited next is
microservices when we talk about
microservices so
microservices are shorter Services which
are running inside bigger Services it is
an approach in which a single
application is composed of many Loosely
coupled independent services so
microservices emerged to address the
limitations of Monolithic architectures
which we will initially using such as
scalability flexibility
productivity to answer all those
things we got the concept of
microservices so what are the advantages
of microservices when a single code is
divided into multiple shorter codes so
updating the codes is more easy now
updating is
easier what
else scaling can be
done of each unit independently
what else fault
isolation if a part or a unit is in
fault it will not impact the entire uh
structure one point which I want to see
say updating is easier scaling can be
done independently fold
isolation what else okay I will give you
a
hint since these are different units
okay I'll just uh ask in yes or no since
these are in different units can we use
multiple programs in it multiple Pro
programming
languages so the answer
is yes
so basic and most advantageous thing of
microservices we can use different
programming languages defining different
structures different component
structures what do you think about
disadvantages hetrogeneous language that
is good yes that's the
answer uh chanji did you get the answer
now why it is
yes all right so think
about uh brainstorm on the disadvantages
what are the disadvantages the answer
lies here
only so the disadvantage number one
is disadvantage number one which you can
feel if you are using different
languages in a set would yes so the
answer is
complex
structure complex or complicated we can
say what
else what will this turn
into so if we talk
about Sunil badri harender
all of them they are pointing to one
thing which
says testing can become
complicated so when you have made a
complex or complicated structure and QA
has to test it then they have to test it
for different languages different things
different
services
so now let's let's talk about a case
study uh case study of
uber we are talking about Uber uh the
taxi application of
course so Uber like other startups it
created monolithic architecture for its
application but it forgot to include
stability and stability in its software
uh I guess because it didn't know it
would be very popular worldwide so it
missed that scal scalability
part so it
used monolithic
structure when I talk about monolithic
structure what is what it is it is a
single tired application that compiles
all components
all components in a single
program that means it was not working on
microservices all components were on in
a single
program what are those
components what were those
components client side user interface
server side business
logic
Integrations data access
layer so all of these components were
now in a single program rather than
running on a different services so that
made the application very
heavy and it now started making problems
for
Uber so for why because for even a short
Change uh in the application they had to
go through the entire program see where
that particular function is change it
and failure of one
program failure of of one
component could bring
down
entire
system so as the
services increased it became very
difficult for Uber to
sustain that's when they shifted
from single program monolithic structure
to
microservices so now when they shifted
to
microservices the load was less because
now it was
decentralized every unit was
independently functioning without
impacting the
other so now because they were
independent dependency on other features
was removed and from that from that
phase onwards Uber benefited by shifting
its architecture from monolithic to
microservices and that was a Learning
lesson for other uh applications which
were their competitions in Global
Market so talking about security
policy as the name says security policy
is an overall general statement produced
by Senior Management that dictates
security within the organization
so what is it what it
is an
aggregate of
directives
regulations
[Music]
rules
practices all of these are aggregated
that prescribes how an organization
manages protects and distributes the
information
manages
protects and
distribute the information for any
company you are currently working in
they have their own set of
policies some says you cannot plug in
USB uh
in your
laptops some says you can plug in but it
won't
work some says no media connection is
allowed be at your own phone to the
laptop because you can steal the
information so this is uh how
different companies frame different
policies based upon their sense of
security how are these uh how to make
flowchart here let's see
okay what are the how can we divide it
into strategic and tactical let's see
so we start
with
laws
directives and regulations
followed
by the
policies followed by they call it
mandatory
standards these are further followed
by detailed procedures
[Music]
recommended
guidelines and
baselines top they follow top to bottom
bottom approach
so till
here it's all
strategic and this
part this part is
strategic that means the core or VIPs
they make these things ciso CTO
CDO they sit together to make laws
directives and
regulations
policies while the mandatory standards
detail procedures these
are tactics
based so when we called about tactic
based that means the techical team which
is there to see on mandatory standards
the guidelines and baselines they are
responsible for these parts the lower
one talking about standards all right
talking about
standards standards are nothing
just okay I'll just write it here
only when you talk about
standards standards
are m mandatory
activities
actions or
rules designed
to
support higher level
policies so stand stands are
basically designed to support these
higher level laws directives regulations
and security
policies they are very
specific technical they include
specifications for what Hardware you'll
be using what software you'll be
using examples of standards that we talk
about in uh cyber security is
aasp
M these are the standards that we look
after when we talk
about cyber security so aasp MIT s25
these are the
standards talking about procedures what
is the difference between standard and
procedure
[Music]
it's generally called sop if you hear
about sop it is they are not talking
about the soap or anything else it
is standard operating
procedure
standard operating
procedure what it is it is a detailed
stepbystep sequence of activities that
are necessary to perform a specific
security
task if someone some of you are working
in endpoint
security then you know that there's
certain procedure with which you check
for uh the end Point Security uh so we
have Network guys here so there are
procedures with which you check for
firewall rules there are procedures with
which you check for the routing
table there are procedures with which
you change the routes if you are given
that access you cannot just go and
change the routes uh without opening a
change so first it will go to cab which
is change management board and then if
it is approved then you can change the
routes so that's the soap or procedures
or standard
operating procedure that we call
it procedures are at a lower level than
standards so
standards are at a higher level than
procedures as we can see in this flow
diagram
so answer procedures and policies are
Dash are
the
uh policies and procedures are Dash
option
a option A
is
unimportant option b is
mandatory option C
is
casual option D
is none of these
so talking about
guidelines what are guidelines you know
what is procedure what is standards so
these are important
when you set an interview
for these are more of information
security things rather than cyber
security things they ask you for
standards procedure guideline what are
the
differences in
guidelines you
have guidelines as the name says they
are just recommendations they
are the recommendations on
on
how standards and Bas
line are
implemented
whoops so guidelines are the
recommendations on how standards and
baselines
are
implemented so that's why
uh guidelines are at the lowest end
because it doesn't talk about something
very necessary or
immediate what does it talk about the
guidelines talk about of different
levels
let's talk from the base which says why
we are doing
it what are we doing when we talk about
why it is defined in
policy when we say what are we doing
those are defined by
standards how are we doing
it that is done by
procedures and guidelines are just for
your information FYI
is guidelines or recommendations
see how we
develop a security policy where can we
get uh an idea from where we
can make a security
policy so let's see
let's do a short
activity
so we can have a Little Help
From A Tool uh a web browser only so
what we are going to do we are going to
develop an application security policy
uh using a template from where we are
going to get the template
we are going to get that template from
sans.org
which template okay it's free policy
templates is already
there so we need to have information
security policy so just click on
it home security policy project
so which policy do we
need we are talking about application
security so let's go to application
security we have web application
security policies you can download as
PDF or doc but since uh we will be
making changes according to our company
company name and all I will download doc
so it is getting
downloaded you can do it sideways so
let's do it
together so once you have done
it simply open it from the downloads We
web application security
policy so you see
it the entire
policy you can remove the things you
don't
want so web application security policy
change the company name your company
name change it
here wherever it is company name just
filter it out you can remove the footer
header and Footers as per your
requirement so it will will talk about
everything if any new or major
application is released third party or
acquired web application patch releases
emergency releases annual
review how we uh Define the severity
which are the high severity medium sity
low sity
issues the standards that we are using
is a wasp
so here you will just whatever tools you
using just mention it here you're using
Color Linux as operating system any
other tool that you're using mention it
here compliance policy is
here so you see standards policy and
processes here testing guide is
provided change these dates according to
how you want it responsible would be
your security
team just make summary of change what
have you changed is it
application
uh
updation or anything related to it so
this is from where you can make your own
web application security policy
okay wants to know from where should we
download it as if it is sans.org
so once you move to sans.org
I'll just share
this all right oasp is the standard that
we
used oasp is the standard that we used
for uh taking care of the
vulnerabilities in our domain when we
talk about aasp aasp has top 10
vulnerabilities which keep on changing
every four years so latest one was in
2021 so this is was top
10 for 2021 it was so I told you it
changes every four years so before 2021
it was 2017 before 2017 it was 2013 so
when we talk about top 10 it says what
are the most impacted vulnerabilities in
any web application we talk about
initially it was injection which was
mostly uh impacting any web application
now it is at number three now the most
impacted one is broken Access Control
cryptographic failures is number
two insecure design is number four and
so on
on I guess you people have done it in uh
Enterprise the first module that you had
covered with the other trainer I guess
it was part of that module not
sure so our next topic
is
what's secure your
software
requirements when we talk about uh core
security requirements what are the core
security requirements with which your
training
started what are those three
requirements which should be there in
any case what are those
Triads so the core software requirements
are
CIA
exactly it
says
[Music]
confidentiality
Integrity
availability so uh everything in cyber
security or information security
revolves around these core
values for confidentiality
uh okay apart from these three there are
three
extra
uh add-ons which says
authentication we call it AAA
authentication
accounting and authorization
when you talk
about
confidentiality that
means any sensitive data should be
protected at any cost
so sensitive data should be
protected how we protected by using
some encryption
mechanisms we mask passwords other
sensitive information we we mask it we
do not store passwords or sensitive keys
in clear text we have key pass or
something like those type of tools where
we uh
save sensitive data like
passwords we use TLS to protect against
attacks just we had a short discussion
about DLS 1.2 and 1.3 they are just the
security measures we do not store any
sensitive information in log files
because it's easily visible the logs are
very easily
accessible when we talk about integrity
Integrity says okay as a person when we
talk in lame language in Integrity is
your actions should match your words
that's that's how you say how integral a
person
is and cyber security that means any
data any data that was actually intended
to be
sent any data that was actually intended
to be
sent from client side
to the server
side should be
intact free of errors and send as it
is so if my
client had to
send ABC that two in caps the receiver
should receive ABC that to in same
format in caps
and not uh some
other content which is unrelated XYZ or
something like
that should not
be so in other words all user inputs
must be validated for Malicia or
disallowed content before
processing all published software should
provide a computed digital signature to
validate its correctness and
completeness so let's add that
requirement here digital
signatures so digital signatures are
tested to check if the content to be
delivered is integral and it is not uh
it is not amended on the
way when we talk about
availability availability
says it should be available 24 cross
7 so the software must meet all the
requirements of the SLA of 59 that means
should be available
at
99.9999% of the time these are the slas
that most companies uh adhere
to if I'm providing a service to any
other company so I would say that my
service availability would
be up with the
0.1% downtime so so that's the
availability that I'm ensuring to my
client the software must be able to
support up to 300 users at any point
and point of time it should not be the
case as the load increases my
application is crumbling so availability
is availability also defines that
application do not crumbles under the
load
what else should be under availability
what do you think should be under the
availability one is
restoration as early as possible if it
is a P1 or high priority issue the
restoration should be within 1 hour of
the
disruption the last point
is no adulteration no modification
allowed during transition that is true
Disaster Recovery how do you do it how
how is disaster recovery
done you are very near to it but
backups what's the other name uh okay
backups
is uh if you are getting impacted and
you have some backup what during the
attack snapshots okay a little far away
but all right one
word run more than multiple side what is
the one word for it fail
over so STI has answered it we call it
either failover or
redundancy yes uh that's that's that
only Network guy will understand badri
yes High
availability that's uh failover or
redundancy would be the uh main cost say
if I'm having two routers one of them
fails I still have the other router of
some other company working for me so
that ensures the availability of
services in case BT goes down AEL is
still working tataa goes down BT is
still
working so that's where redundancy comes
into place moving forward
Authentication all right what do you
understand by
[Music]
authentication it
says only authorized persons would be
allowed
uh I have
some endpoint security
for my
company if I want uh some third party to
use it only those some other person from
other company to use it for any reason
it should be my responsibility and only
that person who it is who who it belongs
to the credentials for which the
credentials are created only he is
allowed to use it again using MFA
multiactor authentication so that
provides the authentication
part for external users I'm talking
about MFA for internal users it could be
single sign on because we know that they
are using the company's domain if I'm
using at theat simply learn.com I'm able
to use engage X and learning learn
simply learn both with single sign
on
authorization says all right you have to
be very very clear the difference
between what is the authentication and
authorization talking about
authorization
uh only users with admin roles will have
permissions to execute
operations so authorization means the
level of access you are
having authentication means if you are
allowed to do
it authenticator users will have read
and write permissions at regular users
because they are allowed authorized
would be having the maximum scope of
XS if we talk about
accounting so I saw someone talking
about non-
reputation that comes
under accounting part why I made a
change uh in some server or some route
and routers or some firewall uh rule I
made a change and then I'm denying it I
haven't done it so accounting says we
will simply check the logs it will show
the user name of the person who has made
the changes and thus supporting
non
reputation I cannot deny that I have not
done it because logs are showing it
so accounting is nothing
but
logs and what does log show it shows
identity what action you have taken on
which object you have taken the action
what is the time
stamp next part we will be discussing
about General
Security
requirements so the General Security
requirements
are session management we don't want our
session to be
hijacked nor we want it to get compromis
in between we are doing our
work errors and ception
management
config
parameters
management so when we talk about session
management so session management says
AAA
protocols summary on AAA protocols
sure so you
have
AAA this one is good
best is
Wikipedia I was at session management
when we talk about session management
requirements it says each user activity
must be uniquely
dragged so if I'm doing something I'm
being traged what I'm doing in what
application say if I'm using identity
access management then again it is
tracked what I'm in there if I'm using p
which is privilege access management
what I'm doing there there is being
traged the user should not be needed to
provide their credentials once
authenticated so if I'm once
authenticated it would be very
irritating if they if uh it's asking for
credentials again and again user session
must be explicitly invalidated when user
logs off or closes closes the browser
so if I talk about uh when
you use your mobile applications or web
app for banking
requirements even if you click on the
back button or refresh button by mistake
you have to relog in again and again so
that's a best of session management
thing I have seen where you have to
relog in again if you
want to take any
action which reloads the page so that's
a security thing which safeguards you
from any mm man in the middle attack
session identifiers used to identify
session must not be easily guessable not
been clear text so whatever cookies that
are being sent from your system they
should not be in clear text no one no
one if someone is using men in the
middle tools like BB Suite they should
not be able to see what data you are uh
you are transacting with your banking
website in clear
text error and exception management uh
so all the exceptions must be explicitly
handled using blogs error messages
displayed to the end user will reveal
only the needed
information security exception must be
audited and monitored uh
why we are doing error and exception
management when we will be talking about
the SQL injection attacks uh we were
talking about from where we will
know uh that the back end is an SQL
Server so the error that we are we would
be getting it would be showing that all
right uh SQL syntax error nothing found
in the DB something of that that so
something of that sort you'll be getting
so that shows me that okay first thing
that it's an SQL syntax error that means
the database is SQL all my attacks now
would be SQL based there are certain
payloads uh which use SQL attacks uh
injection attacks Boolean algebra and
all we will be uh learning about it in
our main course
so that provides
me a hint that SQL is running in the
background so I will just move to as a
blue teamer as a defense teamer I will
move to
the programmer or developer and ask him
to not show this exception or this error
that we have SQL running in the
background so attemp SQL injection right
away so I will ask him to remove that
error by any means it should not be
visible on the
UI so that's how Ern and exception
management is
done when we talk about config
parameters management the configuration
file or web application such as database
connections they should be encrypted to
prevent unauthorized disclosure so
sometimes uh some files the config files
for web apps
are open in plain text rather than
encrypted or even some passwords are
hardcoded in this software code that it
cannot uh this this was one of the
recent example I uh came forward while
doing source code evaluation that
username password was hardcoded in the
code itself so
that uh any attacker would have this as
a cherry on the cake that just open the
source code you have your username
password there only just use them log
into the system and do whatever you
want all initialization and disposal of
global varibles should be carefully
monitored so wherever you are declaring
Global variables in the code you should
be very carefully declare those because
those could be called from anywhere in
the
code operational security requirements
so operational security
requirements most critical flaw that can
impact any business or brand must be
addressed
immediately
whenever okay what is the environment in
which uh we test the web apps before
deploying them on
prod what is that environment
called
uad testing environment or simulated
environment staging
environment sandbox yeah uh correct
sandbox so any flaw that can impact the
business and the brand must be addressed
immediately after thoroughly testing in
simulated or testing environment all
security incidents must be handled
following an incident management process
root cause of the incident must be
identified I'm not sure how many of you
have worked on root cause analysis so if
there is any incident uh either in cyber
security or networks or whatever domain
generally the stakeholders demand for
RCA root cause analysis so that includes
every step from the very start to the
very end how it was discovered what
steps were taken how it got missed what
are the Improvement
plans so these things are a part of
operational
security
operational security
so what are
the requirements in deployment
environment we have uh talked about the
testing environment or
uat or sandbox what are the requirements
in deployment
environment first of
all in deployment environment I will
check
if software is deployed
on
internet
externet or
Internet Internet is which can be
accessed from anywhere intranet is your
company's Network inside your company's
intranet Extranet is governed by the
firewall determine if the software will
be hosted in
DMZ so what is
DMZ
if the
software is hosted in
DMC and which ports are
available which ports are open or
available
DMZ is nothing but demilitarized
zone very important de
mized very important word and when you
are part of infra team you must know
what is
DMZ so talking about
DMZ just to check if we are having any
questions
de militarized Zone yes but what it
is
say all
right say this is the
internet this is the internet flowing to
your
company here it's a firewall
all right let it be a router
first it's a
router then a connection to
firewall although I guess DMZ was
also uh discussed should have been
discussed in the infrastructure part but
again
I'll share it with you what DMZ is
because it is an important
[Music]
ter so anything between the internet
which is your
ISP anything between is
ISP and
your inet or your local
net
is DMZ or d militarized
z it do
contains router to router connection
this router is from your ISP this router
is from your company so this entire
region in between these is called
this entire region is DMC between this
router which is of B AEL or Tata or
BT and this router which belongs to
Simply Lear say this is firewall or
switch and it further connects to the
systems inside
it is separated from rest of the infra
or it it is not I won't say separated
but it is a shared Zone it is a shared
zone between you and ISP so anything
happening here would be decided by ISP
and uh your company that who would be
responsible for it so this entire zone
is DMZ Zone which is mutually shared
between it's just like the Z Z zone
between any two company any two countes
border this border lies with country
a this border lies with country
B this Zone in between is DMZ
demilitarized if that helps giving an
example that this plays between
your uh your network and the internet
the space in between is
DMZ so if you are hosting
any
software back to a point if you are
hosting any software in DMZ if you are
hosting any software in this space then
again uh this is one of the risky uh
things to do so if it is here you should
have this internet uh this this subnet
whatever subnet is this you have to keep
it under scan so you can use Nessa scan
or buite scan to keep checking about any
uh vulnerabilities that could impact
that
software here in
DMZ which privileges that will be
allowed in production environment very
important what privileges are allowed
generally privileges uh the admin or
root privileges are provided only to
the very important VIP of that project
and not to
all we have to
determine
if
sensitive data is
floating so determine if the software
will use a load balancer and or a
cluster
architecture so if we are using any load
balancer these all questions should come
into our mind when we are talking about
the operational security and development
environment so uh we still have 7
minutes for this class I will
be asking few questions to all of you
try kindly try to answer them tomorrow
we will be
starting
uh from a topic called anti-piracy
requirements
archiving and anti-piracy
requirements the website I'm using is
wayb back
machine in Wayback machine talked about
Uber I searched how Uber used to look
from the very
start I search it browser
history it showed me every Uber website
Uber geek Uber humor but I was concerned
about Uber caps which is here uber.com
it says that it
has more than 3 l captures from 1998 to
2016 so I'm interested to see
it when I click on 1998 December 12 1998
this is how it looked like just like any
normal uh startup taxi
service clients Services
press uh mind it it is just a snapshot
it won't be interactive if you click
over it it won't interact when I clicked
on March
2014 this is how it showed me that login
sign up get it done sign up for
Uber
reliable feedback
matters and after that if I want to see
in
2019 so this is how it looked like in
2019 and we know that now it was working
on Spa after 2016 and
17 you click on ride you click on fried
you click on Transit it will work in
that element
without uh reloading all the PES so this
is how it looked
like similarly if you want to look in
currents date say last year
July June 23 Uber looked like
this it's still loading since it's
fetching it from archive the loading
speed is
slow so this is what it shows
you
currently not only Uber you can have any
website have
it any website say want to see
facebook.com
or google.com any website that you want
to
see so since it's working in the
archives loading speed is slow now you
see it's showing you
Facebook this is how it shows in 2024
how it was back in time in 201
and6 in 2006 this is how Facebook looked
like email and password were on left
side
corner now what is the main use of
Wayback machine uh although it is a part
of the data collection of any uh Target
but uh just to let you know sometimes
uh during uh the upgradation of any
website or any portal say if you are
uh targeting any company uh I'm not
talking about Facebook or uh Uber just
an example
uh sometimes when you see the old
captures of any Target say even I'll
take an example of Simply learn even
though simply learn never existed that
time but yes uh sometimes in
initial
uploads initial snapshots you would find
find any email address of uh of any ex
employee of the CEO or some important
figure so that email address could be
used to move inside that company I can
use that email address to start my
fishing attack to provide any payload
inside the company so that's why Wayback
machine is used and what it shows now
you know what it shows it shows
the older and the newer versions of any
website talking about the extensions
that I asked you to download yesterday
how to download them simply use Shan
extension
download and you'll be able
to download it for Chrome for Firefox
whatever you you are
using similarly for webalizer
S go here download
it so that's how you will be downloading
the extensions loopholes unintentional
yes uh if you have shared any number
which I can use that is it safe to
download on office laptop I guess uh no
one would question it because it is not
you are not attacking anything you're
just getting the information say uh I'm
using it on my office laptop only but I
do have some other extensions also I
have grammarly n and safe
web n and safe web provides
you an idea which uh which link is safe
to use and which is which might be uh
fishy so if you're having these kind of
extensions I don't think any uh company
would have any issue with it because
it's not used for attacking anything but
just to get knowledge of the page you
are visiting you would be questioned
when you try scanning any uh any company
any website or any Target then you'll
come into action because that would be
visible in their infrastructure someone
is trying to do that and very impressed
that people are coming outside their
comfort zone outside their main domain
and uh trying to learn about the
security things that that was very
impressive of this
batch uh back to the topic that we were
doing so we had to discuss archiving
requirements and anti-piracy
requirements when I talk about archiving
requirements archiving requirements ISS
uh if we want to Archive something any
data if we want to Archive does it
comply with regulatory requirement or
organizational policy can I archive
anything and
everything so first is has to be in
accordance
with organizational
policies next is the parameters it
should Define
uh the
location
duration
format uh generally as a cyber security
engineer I recommend my office or my
team to Archive the data for 3 to 5
years only because anything after five
years at the team level is irrelevant it
might be relevant at the upper uh
stakeholders level but at the base
workers level anything more than 3 to
five years is obsolete it cannot be
used so when we talk about archiving
requirements
we will firstly think
of the
data or
information that needs to be
stored so our scope is
fixed after that we will determine the
storage space needed for
it what else
uh if the data is transactional that is
remote and online or will it be offline
storage that means
data at
rest or
motion
or
online and offline
data we will be categorizing it on these
basis if you want to store dat
you want to Archive data what would what
would be the best way to do it would it
will it be good to store it as read
write or will it be good to store it as
read only archives are always read only
because if it is read right anyone can
distort the actual
data so third one
is
ensure the dat data is not
rewritable that means it should be only
read
only so one mistake that companies
generally do they ignore the speed of
retrieval so when you are archiving data
you should keep in mind uh how fast you
can retrieve the data it it won't be a
good idea that you are backing up data
you are archiving data but you have
to uh it takes years to get it back or
months to get it back then it is of no
use so speed of retrieval is another
thing that should be in your mind uh
while thinking about archiving
requirements what what what
else the one point which I I shared
earlier
is
duration duration to store 3 years 5
years depending upon what your company
finds
good what else any regulatory
requirement that is required to store
that
data generally any data which talks
about Finance or stocks or something
like that those are under regulatory
requirements otherwise it it might
simply be used for insiding trading uh
which is illegal so the data that has to
be archived has to be under regulatory
requirements and last but not the
least determine
the format you want to store it as CSV
you want to store it as PDF you want to
store it as Excel sheets only talking
about anti piracy
requirements so we all know what is
piracy uh creating a clone or duplicate
from a legitimate copy that comes into
piracy it's done for movies videos
games
so how to to uh not fill a trap of
piracy digitally sign it
digitally sign the
software so if you digitally sign a
software there are very less chances
that it could be tempered or reverse
engineering could work on it increase
the complexity of source
code so if if you
increase the complexity of source
code that would if you increase the
complexity of source
code that would make it difficult for uh
anyone who wants to uh clone it because
he knows he don't knows uh which how
many microservices are running inside it
uh which micro service is talking about
which
unit what
else if anyone of you have uh
anyways used piracy did piracy you know
that there's the license key if if
anyone had ever used pirated operating
system you know that license keys are
either hardcoded inside that license
file or you find it over the Internet so
next part is do not hard
code the license Keys when you hard code
it it's easy to use those those license
keys to make it look like
original Implement a dynamic license
verification checks
why Dynamic checks because if uh someone
is using license key of some other
product on
his example would be operating system
only then if Dynamic checks are there
and we see uh license key missing for
actual product being used on pirated
product then uh the pirated product
would face a
blackout so last would be
Dynamic
license
verification check
process okay Dynamic license
verification check process says uh how
to check if the actual license key is
being used somewhere say if you are just
checking it once passively uh once in
year or once just when it was launched
you checked it once that okay license
key is at right place doing good
Dynamics is you have to keep repeating
that check process after every random
number of months days so that you got to
know that yes license is being used on
the actual or legitimate software and it
is not misused somewhere else so that
that whats Dynamic
checks after that we have
sequencing and time
requirements when you talk about
sequencing and time
requirement sequencing means uh there
shouldn't be any reason uh in the loop
uh in the code that it results in a loop
uh sometimes there are infinite Loops
that can occur due to programming or
logic errors so if there's a loop
preventing the program from reach reach
its exit condition for example sometimes
your system is not having any physical
issue but you start it it shows you your
uh manufacturer say if it is HP it shows
you HP reboots again starts again shows
HP reboots again starts again shows HP
so these kind of infinite Loops from
where you cannot uh get out just by
restarting the
systems it utilizes your resources like
CPU and memory uh which may cause system
crashes or performance
problems sometimes it's it's your
operating system as a software which is
the culprit sometimes it is something
that you have downloaded say uh you were
using some application which was having
some issues which is interacting with
the operating system and a loop is
created these kind of things impact the
resource utilization and these Loops
have to be
killed now uh if I talk about python as
a
language it has a while uh
okay how would a python show any Loop
any statement if it is
true while true it will
show say I said if it if the statement
is true
print this is an
infinite Loop
now this could be anything which I say
if it is true then infinite Loop will
start
so these kind of things in a code can
invite these kind of disrupting things
which could lead to your system
crashes
so how
to avoid
these we talk about need for data
classification when data is
classified it
enhances the Triad the Triad is nothing
but
Cia focuses on
Pro proper
control and
implementation if you have proper
control and implementation these things
would be under check sequencing would be
under
check
hit standardize
the
requirements so how to ensure that that
these things are taken care
of how to make sure that these are taken
care
of uh if I don't want anyone to touch my
code or to include anything like this in
my code which is uh which I have
authored what I will do I will talk
about techniques like anti
tempering anti
reversing anti tempering anti reversing
and code signing
if any could if anyone could answer
ofation what is offers cation what is
the code of
fation so when we talk about code of
fation uh in the similar way that you
answered it's just making it making our
code hard to read uh or hard to
manipulate so if you make your code
complex or hard to read to secure yes to
avoid tempering or to secure it from uh
any attacker it's called code of fation
even if it get Le leagued or attacked by
attacker since it is off
fiscated no uh an encryption in a lay
language is password protection so we
are not uh provide it providing it
password protection yet we are just
making it complex to read so
securing from attacker it is a type of
security yes type of security but how we
are providing that security we are just
making the code more complex or
unreadable
for anyone else means only I know which
microservice is running where how to
call which function in which place
making it more complex that only I know
how it is
executed yes yes that's that's the exact
in English meaning of what we are
studying but same in in similar way
office means making it hard for anyone
to guess your password so generally for
corporates password ofation means it's
it should be we have the GRC people here
they know what password of first is it
it is making it 18 digits it uh it
should be 16 to 18 digits it should
contain
capitals special characters Smalls yes
making it mix of all of these correct so
let me show you uh how you ofate any
code use of paraphrase with special
characters yes you can use paraphrase
paraphrase is nothing that password only
with special characters
numerics let me show you one example
how can we off uscate any code
say I want I have something written in
JavaScript but I want to offis skate it
do we have any tool the answer is yes we
do have it how we can do it let's
see off skater
W
do
first so this tool is
for okay so this is just an example uh
this is a
code uh which says hello world the basic
code that we all always is talk about or
we started our coding with these kind of
codes if I ask it to off uscate this so
now do you know what was written inside
it so this is how the codes get offers
skated you just know that it's some
function is starting and here it's a
semicolon
rest you don't
know it's showing hello world somewhere
here
distorted so this was my example if you
want to have any other code just try it
off skate it you will see the output
here so you want to you don't want to
copy paste just upload your file
confiscate it share it to anyone you
want ask the
to
uh
to recode it and it will show the entire
actual
code so this one is a good tool for code
ofation you can choose your options
according to you you want to change it
to something other mangled dictionary so
it will do that
so now it's just in dictionary
errors because I changed it
here change it to something other
mangled so it is mangled it will now
offis skate in mangled
manner so any way you like you will be
able
to generate any application server
security or network security incident
handling
related policy from this
page talking about ENT reversing
techniques so as the name
says can you show one more example
uh example of code or on off first
skater sure
uh just have any sample code you can get
any code from gitlab but say any sample
code in
python python program to convert Celsius
to Fahrenheit
okay so we have this code with
us let's
have so this is the code
using office
skater okay this is Javascript code
offers sker so I
[Music]
will check for any JavaScript sample
code in Js
JavaScript
example to swap two variables so we have
some code
for swap swapping two
variables I'm taking the comments along
so comments are
included using off office
skater simply pasting it here
it could be my original
code or something from stack
Overflow off uscate
it this is the output that it is
generating you see you cannot understand
what it
is so this is another
[Music]
example so these are JavaScript example
similarly you can find Python and other
code examples
all right your query was that what is
the requirement of doing it why are we
uh offer skating the code in the very
first place so we are doing offer cation
uh to make it confidential between if I
don't want my code to be read by anyone
else I want to be read only by
anab I would share it even if I share it
in group chat this one it would be in
offer skated form no one would know what
it is written but you know that I would
communicate it with you that it's offer
sked just use any ND offer skater and
retrieve the actual code back so that's
where it is being used
perfect the offer skater itself is using
uh encoding it's encoding it into
whatever you are asking it
to encode in so if you see here what is
this it is nothing just want to encode
it in hexad decimal it will encode it in
exod decimal if I want to encode it in
some dictionary thing it will encode it
in dictionary dictionary
thing all right so talking about anti
reversing techniques as the name
says perfect uh anti divers techniques
as the name says reversing techniques
that means somewhere it's talking about
reverse engineering now what is reverse
engineering reverse engineering is the
process of analyzing software to
understand how it works towards gaining
knowledge to duplicate or enhance the
software when we talk
about anti reversing for that firstly we
need to know what is reverse
engineering reverse engineering
is a term which you will very casually
uh listen while working in cyber
security field what does it
mean it's nothing but how you
analyze the
software software is already built it is
already there functioning well you
analyze the
software to
understand how it works
gaining knowledge to duplicate or
enhance it so if there are clones of
say if you go on uh if you clone some
software say if
there's swiggy we also have
Z we also have
other examples
like easy sh
which are relatively newer
so if you see they are pretty much alike
these softwares are pretty much alike
they work on similar model they work of
similar base similar examples
are
Ola
Uber in Drive
blue cabs if you
see all of these
have similar UI structure even
Rapido these these they are one point
they are competitors another point they
have similar applications they know that
they have
understood the customer requirement the
customer psyche even if it was started
by one here it's Uber here it's either
sgy or Z don't know which one started it
uh but once the code was
there one programming one programmer of
the entire
team put in
efforts the code was
out
cloned made it for any other term any
other uh company so even if you search
for any of these codes as a programmer
you might find them
online the earlier versions or off
firsted versions but that would be
enough for you to clone it so this is
nothing but reverse engineering you are
trying
to make it from something that is
already there generally programmers what
what do programmers do for any
application they have have an idea from
gitlab or stack Overflow the codes are
already there they have it from there
customize it according to our
requirement and then that's where
reverse
engineering is used
so me as a person working in sui orato
or Uber I won't I won't feel good if my
code is
reversed or if reverse engineering is
being done on those codes for without
giving me any monetary benefit another
companies's made using those codes so
that's where ENT reversing comes into
play that's where reverse
Engineers
are are stopped making these uh things
because that's again is illegal because
the copyright thing is already with the
original author of that code so what do
you think is the best defense against
this reverse engineering things what
have we
studied it's called copy
paste okay in Layman it's called copy
paste right you copy paste and then you
customize it according to your wish okay
Aran says what is stack overflow stack
overflow
it gives you an idea of uh codes means I
have heard that programmers use tack
overflow to get an idea of codes they
are trying to
develop uh in other words we call it
inspiration we got inspired from that
code and that's why we
are making it better in our own infra so
code ofation is required if we copy
paste code C code ofation is required to
stop that copy base thing so this is the
answer of my question my question was
what is the best defense technique
against reverse engineering so answer is
offers skate the codee you offers skate
it no one would would know what it is
written there so reverse engineering
would be bit harder
okay I remember a question was there
from someone uh that if everyone knows
that the code is offers skated and how
to decate it what is the benefit of
it if I'm sharing the offers skated code
I will not let you know that it is a
code why would I let you know that it is
a code that's the uh that's the gist of
sharing that with you so
only that only the actuality would be
shared with anyone I would like to share
my code with for rest of all it is just
crap which we do not understand what it
is written just a random pair of strings
while the one say if I want Aran or
badri to know that it is actually a code
so I would let them know that just de
offers skate
it's uh offers skated in hexa or binary
de offers skate it and they will get the
code even if I'm sharing it in
public how would that be offis
skated
using D offed using the same you will
just upload the
file here where it's written offers can
just use it and if I have already shared
that it's in hexa used hexa and it will
show you the exact
code otherwise there's uh decoder in BB
Suite once we will be doing BB Suite I
will show you there also how uh these
kind of encoded things you can decode so
we have multiple ways of doing it one of
this is using office skater de off
skater the other one is using encoder
decoder which is again a part of BB
Suite those who are already working in
cyber security field uh they know what
BB Suite is and how it's working we will
we will know it with the course of time
while we complete this
course hope uh the pace of the class is
good today I got feed that it was fast
yesterday but I try to make it little
lighter
today so in anti tempering we were
having anti
reversing in anti tempering we were
having anti-
reversing code
signing and off forcation
offer you know ENT reversing you know
what is code
signing anyone want to attempt code
signing what is code signing the name
says it
all so code
signing
perfect uh sign on code simple right
copyright
exactly so
code signing is the process of digitally
signing the code for example if it is
having some executables or scripts I
will have some private key of the code
author code signing ures that authent
authenticity of published code besides
proving integrity and anti- tempering
protection
uh
uh example of it is how to show that you
are the other
yes yes hashing is part of it uh signing
on code that those things the private
and uh what digital signing is that
would be covered under
cryptography
after after
this officiation things and
all there's a there's an application
called
grabify only if my company allows it to
run what is not
running how it is done code
signing talks about uh as as we saw an
answer from arpen it talks about the
sharing of keys so there are a
combination of keys that are shared so
once you digitally
signed uh the code you are it order the
private key remains with you only you
would be able to execute that code even
if you share it with others it would be
only read only and it it won't be
executed unless and otherwise you share
your private key which would be uh
checked with the public key and executed
so how that is done we all will
so cryptography will talk all about
hashing md5 hashing
sha256 all those things we'll be
covering
there depends uh because there are
different algorithms you can use variety
of them uh DH key
exchange uh I believe is
what earlier uh coders used now they
prefer use hash algorithm for 250
256 yes
uh s 256 is used
currently so I was talking about
grabify just want to show
you if it runs here
okay I believe this is uh the URL which
is not responsive on any
URL connection time
out so since we are talking about uh
cyber security
uh and you people want to have a little
hands on let me show you something
uh for hacking since hacking module is
far away just an
overview there's a thing called ghdb or
Google hacking
database so in when we talk about Google
hacking
database we have variety of things there
present
online you can see vulnerable servers
here you can see index of confidential
files with you see
information again vulnerable servers are
there what El fil you can get filtered
things
uh web server error
message
footholds let's see various online
devices
it would show any online device so using
one of these
exploits this is what we got
so this is some camera which is a live
recording
camera of Le
MC College I'm not sure where it is but
with the time it shows 8:55
a.m. 3rd March 8:55
a.m. that most possibly is
us or
Canada you can
stop sometimes uh you even get the
controls of the camera you can rotate it
in left or
right so now you
have you can see somewhere in the world
using Google hacking database this is
one of the use one of the many
uses it provided you a hold of an online
device so you now as an attacker can
have
so all of this is for education purposes
kindly do not misuse anything try to go
overboard in things till you get
more about it you know more about it so
this is uh what I wanted to show you
just to uh keep your interest intact in
the
topics we'll be starting with the new
topics next we going to
start next topic would
be so this would be
software security Now we will be talking
more
about software
security so I was trying to show you
what Google is capable of doing other
than searching for our
queries so when you talk about Google
hacking
database it shows you all the exploits
uh which are
available I will just reset the filters
because it's showing filtered content so
it shows you vulnerable
servers files containing juicy
information but these are of no use for
me currently since I just want to show
you what Google hacking database is
capable of doing so to show you that
part I will just filter it with any
online machine I will filter it for any
online machine so it's showing me the
different online
machines there's Brother
printer zerox printer laser jet
printer even in in these I will just
want to see
cameras so not using much I will just
open first
few exploits one is from Shilpa one is
from S
takur one is
from yes
now you click on
these
URLs so this is someone using this URL
for something
else no IP
camera I'm not
robot here it's requesting you for login
credentials if you want to brute force
it try uh generally available default
username
passwords but that would
involve okay it says root password might
be
password okay I don't want his camera to
be
logged so we have other cameras also
so now you have got control of some
camera in
some IC area snowy area with controls
here you can move it the
right okay it is requiring a sign in so
for controls you would require sign
in similarly here here's another camera
in
bushes do you have
admin no we don't have admin
so this is one of the thing that you can
do
using uh okay when you talk about t
browser uh you think when you are
visiting the dark web you safe
uh when when you enter to browser your
IP is broadcasted so when you try that
uh when you think that you would be
trying to attack someone meanwhile you
see that your Gmail is
misbehaving so this is my personal
experience I tried using Tor that was
the first and last time uh you you will
see something fishy at your end after
you try using to browser yes I'm talking
about to browser
only uh how to use the DB as a hacker we
will see it this is just this is just uh
this is just a
trailer these sites record our logins
also uh no these are just the cameras
which they forgot to encrypt forgot to
provide encryption so even if I provide
you the IP address of my home camera you
won't be able to log
in uh that's true WESH uh we need to be
very careful in terms of handling that's
why I keep reminding that it's only for
education purposes no one would try
exploiting
anything what about Deep Web Deep Web is
nothing just uh one way to reach Web
Store browser which is also called Anyan
browser uh I won't recommend you to
download it or to move around t
uh
because very professional hackers are
already using those things there so you
won't even know where you get a victim
while you serve Deep Web all right so
any more questions we are heading to our
next
topic software
security so as the name
says as the name says software
security software we already know what
software is
how uh they are used why they are
used uh they are just firmwares that
we used for for our day-to-day
work what we will be learning in
software
security we will be talking
about what
are broken access
controls and their related
vulnerabilities
we will
explain cryptographic
failures we will classify various
applications issues
using we will talk about what are CV
e what are
cwe this these are nothing but common
vulnerabilities how are they named what
is their
nomenclature and we will discuss some
real world
scenarios so a bit more interesting
topic than what we were doing
earlier here we would be talking about
aasp top
10 Sans
25 in better
detail I will remove all these tabs uh
let's see what AAS top 10 says
so it is nothing just a standard that we
people use and it is a globally
recognized
standard globally
[Music]
recognized
standard used for
making websites secure
just to let you know uh even though it
is not part of your curriculum but I
will let you know that aasp top
10 is not just
for web applications but even
for mobile
applications so
covering because we are talking about
softwares web applications so this is
what we'll be working we do have similar
things for mobile also so if anyone of
you is more having more interest in
Mobile security mobile app security then
this is what you can refer to
and for web one point that
we talks about major
vulnerabilities
globally in how many years these are
refreshed so the answer was in front of
of you only when I opened that
link talking more about web
applications but for
mobile I'll just share you the link that
these are the was top 10
for mobile let me share the latest
one we have a a was top 10 for cicd also
yes yes we do
have so even when we talk about was top
10
2013 so these were the a to in
2013 which talked
about injection broken authentication
session management cross-site scripting
insecure D serialization these were
were the things that were impacting
corporates in 2013 with injection at the
top broken authentication and session
management and other things following
it when we talk about
2017 injection is still on the top
broken authentication is at second while
other in 2021 broken exess control is at
number one now what all these uh
loopholes are what these vulnerabilities
are and how it impacts our working in
cyber security we will be discussing it
in the session that's that we are going
to complete since we are talking about
aasp
2021 2021 would start with broken Access
Control cryptographic
failures cryptographic
failures injection insecure design
security Mis
config vulnerable and outdated
components
identification and authentication
failures you will be uh knowing it
knowing them one by
one software and data integrative
failures
security logging and
monitoring and
ssrf before I move into explaining all
this the place from where you will get
the best ideas of of everything which is
Port
sger so if you write any issue say csrf
is one of the issues I will just say
csrf ports
figer this tutorial would be providing
me enough detail of everything and
anything related to the issue uh this is
just to let you know if in case uh you
are trapped somewhere so that's where
you can simply use ports figure to your
defense
so back to where we were broken Access
Control when we talk about broken access
control as the name says that the access
control is broken somewhere so
unauthorized access to system
functionality that
resources
uh and resources that creates
exploitable weakness
so when there's some unauthorized exess
to the system and it could impact that
system's functionality entirely
that's where broken Access
Control we say it is there
so what is example of it uh I don't
want anyone to login into uh a
website but again someone who is very
skillful
he checked out some loophole and was
able to access it uh uh we'll see how we
do it uh there are certain vulnerable
websites available on the internet which
we will be using to see how we can
uh take advantage of loopholes
and do this broken exess control thing
if I'm logged in with an ID of herit say
this engage x.s simply.com
although this is some Zoom meeting but
yes if you say that I'm logged in into
my account
currently is it a way that I change here
something and I'm able to log into any
one of yours account so any these if I'm
able to do that that means the access
control is broken broken
somewhere usually it happens if there is
user ID present in the URL so we try to
change those IDs with some other user
IDs if you are able to login with that
user not this URL but if some URL is
having an ID which belongs to her prit
say this is some ID which belongs to her
prit you change
it use someone else say Chiran jit's ID
I know that Chiran jit's user ID is XYZ
whatever it is I placed that ID here
pressed enter and now this same
page says that the logged in user is not
her prit but
chiranjit so these kind of things we can
do using broken Access Control we will
see how we do
it uh but before doing the Practical
part we will be understanding how
uh these we will understand the theor
theory part first before we move into uh
doing the attacks understanding what
it's done how it is done when we talk
about excess control vulnerabilities
what are the most common
things uh that
we keep in
mind so I'm talking about about access
control
things when I talk about access control
vulnerabilities the example that I just
shared if I'm allowing the primary
key to to be
changed to another users's
account in this example it was harprit
and chanit but you can use anyone's ID
to get access to that users's
account and how it was
done I used bypassing
the access
control checks by
using what did I modify by
modifying
the what did I modify here in this
example uid where did I modify
it where was this
modified in Link and Link is called as
Ry said arip said modifying the
URL so I modified the URL and I was able
to
bypass the control the excess
control what else does it
mean say uh if I'm am changing this
account uh I'm using srishti's account
and srishti is having admin access I'm
just a normal user and sishi is having
admin access so does this mean that I'm
able to elevate my
privilege simply changing the IDS in the
URL I would be able
to elevate the
privilege because now I'm the admin
so there's one application
available uh which is a vulnerable
application I'll side by side I'll try
to exploit that
also it is called a wasp Juice
Shop so here we have this application
it includes certain
challenges we
will do it one by one uh although this
is bonus than what you you are provided
from Simply learn we will be doing those
labs also side by
side all right so when I talk about this
account
thing I want to log in it says all
right uh just provide
your email
password okay I'll first say that I'm
not a customer yet let's see if I find
any fault here then we will move
forward trying to register
so Herre theate yopmail.com yopmail is
disposable
email and some
password say my password is
harprit h
capital H A
harprit 123 all right I repeat the
password h a r
her 1 2 3
it says password matches now I remove 1
2
3 password doesn't match
perfect and if I remove one 2 three from
here so I have
removed it from here now you see that
there's misconfiguration so even though
I have changed my password it still says
that both are matching and we can move
ahead
so let's move
forward it will take my password even
though it's eight digits and it is 11
digits so one of theas top 10
which
says
misconfiguration so you are seeing
misconfiguration here that even
though the condition is not met okay
let's see will will
it allow me to
register registration completed
completed successfully you can now login
all right registration is successful you
can now login now problem for me is I
don't know which password will it take
so let's
see
her
123 it says
no removing 1 2
3 so so you see that the confirmed
password was not
taken but the
one which I supplied earlier was taken
as a
password just to show you that I'm with
the same email address that I showed
you all right so that
was misconfiguration part
let's
see if we could find something else
let's see for injection
okay trying to log
in
generally we
have some
some developers hard code the default
credentials uh which is either admin
admin either admin
password all right it is not taking any
of these it is not taking admin it is
not taking
password can I try
uh some payload I will try doing SQL
injection here for SQL those who know
what SQL is the language is it works on
queries it checks for your query in the
backend database that your query is true
it will execute it if the query returns
false it will not execute that query so
let me see
if I'm using Boolean algebra it says
either
admin or 1 is equal to
1 my password is
password it says it it identifies that
it is an object okay I will
use hyphens to ignore anything after
this and I am inside as an
admin so what what is this this is an
injection attack I'm using SQL injection
here this is how we are doing
it
so this one is an injection okay I would
be providing you one more
example uh what else can we do
[Music]
here what else can I do here
customer feedback complaint
support let me log out and I will do
something
else customer
feedback
Anonymous I hated your
apple
juice and when I say this I HTE your
Apple
Juice 621 62 12
okay what least rating I can give it it
is
one but the apple juice was not even
worth it for one so can I change it
control shift
I can I change that
rating where is it reflecting
here
e e
one way is you make changes
in the code
itself but I'll show you a
more unique way uh we will be using BB
suite for this information to pass
through I'll just
be let me use my BB Suite
so one uh thing would be to check in
inspect
element the other one would be using BB
Suite I'll
just turn on the BB suite and
connect from another site okay
all right so anubhab wants example from
another site so since we are not
attacking any main site we are uh using
vulnerable websites so let's let me show
you another site as
requested there's a site called
test.php
which istics
so test.php is the other
site so
here if you try to use
any because for injection you would
require something to put your payload
inside so you see your payload
executes these kind of executions these
kind of injection attacks are
called
xss
or cross site scripting
text the one that we already saw for the
other payload that was SQL injection
attack
for admin
part
and this one was xss or cross-site
scripting here we used cross-site
scripting we used script what script did
we use and where do we get these kind of
scripts you get these from gitlab so if
I use payloads
for
xss you will get all these lists
available online on
GitHub similarly for SQL
injection so just go there
and use these
for injection attacks kindly do not use
any kindly do not use any of these on
live web
applications I don't want anyone of you
to be suffering legally never use these
on live applications without
permission what codes to use for
injection uh for injection we are using
these payloads that I shared you uh you
have to check which payload works on
which website so cyber security is a
field where you have to invest ample
amount of time so so using payloads from
these list would require you to invest a
lot of
time so these are for xss similarly if
you don't want xss attack you
want SQL
injection you will get that payload list
here so these payload list for SQL
injection
attacks when you have provided your
scope you have to go through it which
payload works over it and yes
that's that's the most time consuming
thing which you'll see as
Reda what is payload payload is anything
uh which you use for the destructive
process so you
want your scope to destroy you use
payad so where else we uh use word
payload if you know we use payload in
defense system so payload is whatever is
inside the rocket whatever is inside the
missile those things are payloads so
similarly
payload means that data portion payload
is used in a sense of
Destruction anything that you use
to yes in networking terms it is part of
the data payLo
yes you talk uh in uh header things that
payad is there in part of in
headers as Rajiv ran said it is the
capacity to carry malicious script query
to Target location for
sure okay
so this is a tool called BB site on
which I'll be showing you uh the method
that I I was showing you how to disrupt
the
rating on any website we were doing that
on aasp Juice
Shop so bub site is again from Port
sger it has its
inbuilt
browser so I'll be opening the
[Music]
browser once the browser is open I'll
restore because it will open do shop
only one feature of BB s is you can
intercept the traffic that means you
control what traffic is
going
so here if
I say intercept is on that means
whatever
traffic is going here I'll be able to
see that
traffic in my proxy So currently
let's currently I'm turning on
off simply moving to the page where I
have have to give the
rating
so we were at customer
feedback I had their say orange
juice so I didn't want to give them even
a single
rating but I know by Bard Mass the
result for this
is
six now when I'm trying to submit this I
will intercept I will turn on The
Intercept BB suit works as man in the
middle so you see the entire traffic it
is capturing it
is it is seeing that as man in the
middle it says okay you say orange juice
is sugary it's Anonymous all
right let's change this rating to
zero here it is not possible I rate zero
but now let's see I submit
it forward this
traffic thank you for your feedback the
feedback has been
taken so when the feedback has been
taken let's see if that feedback is
visible
anywhere
so I will turn off The Intercept
again so it would be
either all right so someone says I love
this some says great shop nothing useful
available here they all are having one
to five
ratings but let's see if our rating is
somewhere
here orange juice was sugary by
Anonymous and it is showing null
rating so this is how you can change the
course of things
uh which
[Music]
browser how do we connect all right I'll
just show it again this
is inbuilt browser in BB Suite so when
you move to proxy you have this open
browser this will open Chromium browser
here so Chromium browser is the inbuild
browser for BB Suite
there are two ways in which you can use
BB Suite it is either professional you
can buy licensed version or just for
practice you can use
BBU uh Community version so some
features are available only in licensed
version
so you won't you you would have 50% of
these in community
version this is on the same ju site yes
uh this was the one that I got
interrupted in so yes it's in AAS Juice
Shop the same one in which we did that
admin part
and what else now since I'm using BBU we
still have 10 minutes let's see what
else we can do using BB Suite another
part
so what else we can use
I forgot to turn on
The
Intercept click
here it is showing me something that
okay
uh uh harjinder BBU is not a site BBU is
a tool
BBU is a tool uh it's not a site you can
download
BBS
online please share the process to
download the BB Suite okay
simply BB
suit just download it from here it will
download the Community
Edition guys sharing the uh processes uh
step by step would be uh hard better
would be if we we are just revising it
through video that would be impressive
right what exactly we are trying to do
uh all right anyone who could answer
this why are we doing
it oh what uh what why are we doing it
what is the
agenda because we are studying aasp top
10 and this is we are trying
to uh study a was top 10 using these uh
just like we did security
misconfiguration injection
attacks broker Access Control uh we were
able to
take over the admin account so using
injection so broker access control all
these
things that's why we are studying BB
suite
and deliberately vulnerable
application yes it is man in the middle
attack yes we are doing
mitm and mitm is taking Q of
what uh communication is going on
between two sender
Ander so where I
was yes I was trying to show you
something else if I send this to
repeater repeater is something that
repeat
things uh it shows me that okay there is
something called FTP legal. MD do not
take stress this is core things uh
because you stressed that you want
something practical I'm showing it but
yes uh this is something bonus apart
from what you you are actually having in
your curriculum but I'm always happy to
uh share more than uh you expect so just
something from my end uh what I'll do
here I will will see okay it is talking
about
FTP it's it's showing me that okay uh
FTB protocol is running and we are
getting a file legal. MD the file on
which I
clicked I clicked on legal. MD here
which says check out our boring terms of
conditions all right it was legal.
MD I would send
it and see response here okay it is
generating some
response what and response is the legal
information there's a legal file which
says I guess it is in some other
language it is talking about something
okay here it is in English no some other
language all right no issues what I'll
do and see if we have anything else uh
inmd one file is is legal on
which uh so when I change this legal
thing I remove legal with
MD and see if we are having some other
files here uh do empty
files okay
if I remove even
FTP are we able to get MD
something doesn't Works what if FTP is
back
and MD is removed we will see any file
any file transfer protocol
here let's see
200 okay that means it is
successful all
[Music]
right if we are having any other file
404 not
found any other file which is using
FTP 200 okay
so you see if I search for MD we have
got another
file Acquisitions
MD it says 12 matches all right
announcement which is an encrypted file.
MD coupons.
MD legal. MD we already have seen let's
see if we are able to see Acquisitions
MD because Acquisitions MD is not
visible on their web page so let's see
if it is visible to see what's written
in Acquisitions
MD so you have find out a confid itial
document this document is confidential
do not
distribute it shows their planned
Acquisitions this is the planned
Acquisitions we will be doing more
practicals but yes uh just to give you a
chist of how cyber security
works this session was was necessary uh

hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel i welcome you all to
this session and in this session we will
be discussing about asp.net versus
asp.net core so before we get started
with the session let's have a look at
today's agenda
we shall begin with learning about
asp.net followed by that we'll be
learning asp.net core then we shall see
some differences between asp.net and
asp.net core after that we shall focus
on versions of asp.net and finally we
shall have a look at versions of asp.net
core
however before we begin make sure that
you have subscribed to our youtube
channel and click on that bell icon so
that you can never miss an update from
simply learn
so without further ado let's get started
about asp.net
in the present the world is developing
its technology in a speedy manner to
make everything like communication
development etc in a better way
all these are used with the help of the
applications when it comes to our mind
for building those applications then
asp.net is the best choice
it is a server-side technology used for
developing dynamic websites and web
applications on the internet asp and
asp.net stands for active server pages
which microsoft provides for building
applications it produces data-driven
interactive web applications microsoft
released the first version of asp.net in
2002 for building dynamic web
applications
now when you have an idea about asp.net
let's understand what exactly asp.net
core is all about
asp.net core is an open source version
of asp.net which have some direct
features compared to asp.net it runs on
three different platforms like windows
linux and mac os the first version of
asp.net core was released in the year
2016 to provide some better features
than asp.net
moving forward let's see some more
differences between asp.net and asp.net
core
applications built using asp.net can be
applicable only for windows but
applications using asp.net can be
applicable for windows linux and mac os
asp.net uses dotnet technology as the
platform for building the applications
where asp.net core uses both dot net and
dot net core as the platform for
building applications
languages that asp.net uses are c-sharp
f-sharp and visual basics.net whereas
asp.net core uses c-sharp and f-sharp
the next difference is the types of
applications using asp.net we create web
user interface applications web apis mvc
applications and signal r whereas using
asp.net core we create web forms web
apis mvc applications and web pages the
performance of applications using
asp.net technology is good whereas
asp.net core applications have
high and better performance
if the user makes any changes to asp.net
that the user has to compile whenever he
makes changes but in asp.net core there
is no need to compile every time it
automatically compiles
now when you know about some differences
between asp.net and asp.net co let's
have a look at versions of asp.net and
asp.net core

destination for 20-somethings around the

know about a sauce from the internet we
have one minute where that digital
platform is out we're not serving our
customers because a sauce offers such a
wide variety of products eighty-seven
thousand at any one time with five
thousand new ones added each week we've
invested heavily in their
recommendations platform we need to help
our 18 million active customers discover
the things they love we really like
cosmos DB as a fully managed database
service cosmos DB is used as model store
the gateway from the offline to the
online data science world's allows us to
distribute the data models to be near
the services wherever in the world

elasticity so we can store data models
of any size we like the very low latency
for random reads during peak sales
periods we need extra compute power to
cope with customer demands and manage
our large data sets on Black Friday 2017

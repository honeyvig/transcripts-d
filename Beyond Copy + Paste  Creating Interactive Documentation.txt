next up we have beyond copy and paste
creating interactive documentation with
Maria Nagaya
thank you so much Mika thanks everyone
for staying tuned with Netcom 2019 and
thank you for listening to my talk so my
name is Maria Nikita I am a senior
program manager on the visual studio.net
team and I want to talk to you today
about interactive documentation and how
we think about that and how it's
important for first-time developers as
well as developers who are continuing to
grow and build on our platform so let's
talk about documentation documentation
is how we build trust with our
developers it's how we educate people
it's how we sell our products and good
documentation means that we are as
invested in our product as much as you
are it's important as we build our
documentation from first-time developers
to people who are building code every
single day that we make sure that their
own ramp is as smooth and as effortless
as possible so let's talk about
documentation today for a few minutes
with documentation today it's getting
really good but there are still a few
assumptions that we continue to make
about our customers first is the
assumption of knowledge sometimes when
content creators are writing
documentation they assume that the
people coming to our documentation have
prior knowledge of the framework and the
languages being taught the assumption of
tech as a content author myself
I sometimes continually find myself
thinking of my experience as the only
experience I sometimes reference the
operating system I'm using I sometimes
reference a version of Windows I always
assume that someone has as good internet
bandwidth as I do so a good example of
this is providing links to certain
specific downloads as well as
screenshots that only reflect a
particular operating system and the last
one is the assumption of time we are all
really guilty of doing that we assume
that the people coming to read our
content or use our videos or a
documentation have more time than they
do usually when people are learning
things trying new things or testing
something
they have a limited amount of time
whether you're an educator a hobbyist or
a seasoned developer you're probably
doing this over your lunch time or just
before you go to bed or just before you
start work so we need to make sure we
cater for that so we look at
documentation today majority of the
documentation looks like this it's
static code right and if we think about
this from the perspective of a net u
developer a brand new first-timer
they're often left wondering what does
this do so we then go to stack overflow
we copy and paste a bunch of code from
here and there but then we still up for
the challenge especially as first-time
developers what template do I use in
Visual Studio what libraries would do I
need what do all these error messages
mean we are telling people that for
their first few lines of code there's a
huge on-ramp or even just to run a
sample for seasoned developers you're
probably working really fast and you
don't want to copy and paste in a copy
and paste code in and out of your
codebase you just want to see if this is
the best thing for you so we've noticed
one thing as we begin to improve our
documentation our expectations have
changed and we expect more from the
people building our content to do more
video has done great work in this space
and we just launched right now with
dotnet videos on how we are investing in
videos and how we are making sure that
our developers have an interactive
experience where they're able to listen
pause and rewind but still we're
assuming a bit of time on your side but
it's really good content so please go
and look out look it up
another thing is interactive snippets
online this has actually become a
requirement for languages and frameworks
when you can see popular languages like
JavaScript and Python allowing people to
test api's and syntax right within the
browser but we're also seeing it in
popularly emerging languages as well
such as scholar and go where people are
able to interact and test API is right
within the browser
but puzzle this is just a few pieces of
the puzzles right so we have video on
one side we also have syntax iteration
online however people want to have
experiences that
Feliz native to the experience they
would have in the browser we're seeing
this in places like Microsoft learn
where people are able to try and test
things out which would be similar to
what their local experience would be so
when they do transition into an offline
experience it feels vaguely familiar but
then we also have the concept of trying
now this is something I constantly do if
I want to try out a new NuGet package I
will create a throwaway predicate see if
it's working I will delete it I will do
it again but you're seeing places like
MPN with the help of companies like run
kids creating these experiences online
we should be able to try out on you get
packages and see what they're like right
within the comfort of our browser and
what we're continuing to see here is a
narrowing of the divide between
documentation and code and the reason
why we're seeing this is a landscape is
continuously growing we have developers
such as people who are watching this
show writing blog posts every single day
we have hobbyists and the hobbyist field
just keeps on growing from makers to web
developers mobile developers IOT from
social media influencers where they're
just constantly learning how to own
their own online experience we have data
researchers who are using and mining
data making these analytical choices to
make more informed decisions we have
educators both CS educators as well as
non-technical educators where we're
seeing in primary and secondary schools
all around the world where non-technical
teachers are given the task to unwrap
the next generation to be comfortable in
this new world of coding and finally we
have our students who want to explore
and learn as much as possible and we
need to provide those opportunities for
them so when we're creating these new
experiences around documentation
especially at Microsoft there are things
that we wanted to make sure that we
landed very comfortably with the
customers we wanted to make sure that
they had up-to-date documentation nice
and fresh referencing articles are when
were from 2019 versus 2003 we wanted to
make it engaging and engaging is not
just about making it flashy and cool you
want to make the navigation really easy
you want someone to land on a
documentation page I know where they
need to go you also want the steps to be
clear and quick and easy so if you got
go-to dotnet right now and you go
getting started you will see how to get
R up and running in ten minutes giving
people the moment to feel empowered in
ten minutes or less
and finally we wanted to create a
friction free learning experience we
wanted someone to be able to go onto a
web page and learn about the language
without having to install all the tools
or know everything and in 2017 we
launched an interactive online
experience with a product that I build
called Trident net which allows people
to experiment and try dotnet the
language within the browser so let's
talk about more about the Trident net
interactive experience and what we offer
them we have our initial goals were in
2017 was to have an interactive
documentation online bring us up to
speed with the other languages that had
been providing this for their customers
most importantly we wanted it to be
login free we wanted to make sure that
someone didn't have to install
everything on their machine in order to
just write console dot write line
HelloWorld we wanted you to give that
quick win and finally we wanted a fast
on-ramp we wanted it so you could edit
the code online click run and see the
results we wanted you to feel that
moment of success but we also noticed
that Trident net is growing and those
are some of the wonderful things I want
to share with you today so when we first
began in 2017 we wanted a friction free
online experience and we did that with
Trident net and you go to dock stopped
Microsoft comm you're able to run
c-sharp code right within the browser
but as we began to notice that there
were certain difficulties first of all
what happened if someone didn't have
good internet access
what if somebody wanted to do this
locally on their machine how are we
creating that experience for you also we
wanted to make a cheaper alternative
that allowed people to run things easily
within their website and luckily in 2018
we also got laser and it allowed us to
pivot from running things and containers
on Azure container instances to running
things on the client side with blazer
and
only that because we created these
experiences will also allow us to create
a local experience with a.net try global
tall and if you look at my slide right
now we have a student in South Africa
who calls is one of the most influential
things that he's used that allows him to
go and share c-sharp experiences with
his fellow students so we thank you and
we hope that you continue to use us and
then we have a special surprise that I
think a lot of you didn't expect but we
also have dotnet running in notebooks
and I'll be sharing that demo with you
later today so let's go and see some
demos now
okay so as I said see Trident Nets
started in the browser so if you go to
any single sample on the docks of
Microsoft comm quickstarts
you notice that we have an editor right
now you can copy the code over run it
and you have the direct results you can
also edit it easily right within the
browser so you're not restricted by own
but what is in the code and you run it
again this is all running on blazer it's
all running on the client side that
allows us to create opportunities where
people could possibly add this to their
websites as well which we're hoping to
enable in the future but I also talked
about the offline experience if any of
you have ever done a workshop or done a
tutorial out there you've probably had
to get people to download the tools
clone the repo make sure than the right
operating system and before you know it
it's two-three hours into the workshop
and nobody has done anything we wanted
to make sure that people could be just
successful with a dotnet SDK and the
dotnet tribal global tool and get things
up and running so I want to give you a
quick demo of that so we have this repo
it's our samples repo you can go to go
to dotnet try slash samples on github
and you'll see four clear extra
instructions where we'll tell you to
install the.net tri global tool which is
available and you get today clone this
repo then once you have this repo clone
I want you to go into the directory and
type dotnet try so as someone who
prepares for demos ahead of time I did
the first three steps ahead of time so
I'm gonna great go right into here type
dotnet try hit run and what this is
going to do using kestrels going to
start up my browser and it's going to
give me an interactive markdown
experience if you look at the top this
is an MD file so I'm going to continue
into introduction to programming with
c-sharp and you'll notice that you have
a list of instructions it's like an
interactive book let's go ahead and run
this code sometimes the first run can
take a few seconds but bear with me you
have hallo world I can go in
change it again and I will put in my
name run it again and I see the results
this gives people the flexibility to run
an experiment within the browser giving
you that nice interactive experience so
I hope that you'll give it a try for the
next workshop that you're a tenth you're
doing or if you just want to try give it
a just try it out but the big question
here is how are we doing this how are we
able to have this mix of interactive
code c-sharp code with a markdown file
so I'm just going to go over to Visual
Studio code and show you some of the
magic that we're running so I'm just
gonna close up the server here so this
looks like markdown that you've probably
written in the past if you've done
anything with a readme file and if you
add any sort of language language
features within your markdown you
usually have to use a flag so you notice
that we have something called si si si s
which is a c-sharp we are pointing to a
specific region right so this is general
c-sharp regions called intro we're
pointing to a source file and we're
pointing to a program dot C as in my app
so let's see what this is if I go over
to my program dot CS you will notice
that I have a couple of regions adored
you have a bunch of switch case
statement and I have a region called
intro so if I edited this and I said
hello dot Netcom and I saved this file
and let's just go ahead and run this
again dotnet tri I go back into my
introduction to c-sharp and I've edited
it right so there's a seamless
difference but another thing that we
have to be careful with is that if
anyone's written documentation sometimes
it gets out of sync like how do we
support our backing project as well as
what we're putting in the documentation
we wanted to make sure that we supported
that so let's make some quick edits like
how do we verify code so I'm going to go
over to this code again and I'm just
going to make some clumsy mistakes over
here I am going to remove the Senate
semicolon save that I am going to change
from intros from intro to intros I'm
gonna say that again and I want to show
you a new addition we added it called
dotnet verifying right so what it's
saying sorry it's not net try verify
okay so this is going through and it's
actually checking your markdown and
checking your backing project to make
sure that everything's going okay and
you'll notice that it says hey you're
missing some things here you're missing
a semicolon and we also haven't found
the intros region so we wanted to make
sure that before you hit push into
github you're able to actually see any
issues that might pop up and we're
allowed we enable you to do that if
you're someone who would prefer to see
this in a UI format it's also supported
on the server on the UI side as well so
I'm just going to click do this do
dotnet try it's going to launch the
localhost again and if I go over to the
introductions it will tell me that the
region hasn't been found so on both
sides you have this experience where
users are easily able to catch what
their mistakes are so let's go on some
to seeing that if you want to look at
this more you can go ahead to our github
repo and please give the give it a try
so I want to show you a little bit more
and other experiences that we've been
creating so I showed you the dotnet try
global tool and I showed you don't know
try running in the browser but I also
wanted to show you something that we
just did this week and I'm really
looking forward to hearing your feedback
if you go to our github repo and you do
dotnet slash try and you scroll to the
bottom which is pretty long you can
notice that we have a lot of files in
there you'll notice that we have the
dotnet try enable bad but we also have
launch to binder
now binder is a project an open source
project where it's able to point to a
github repo and take out all the
notebook files and run them in the
browser so they spin up a nice container
and you're able to look at it right
within the browser over here I already
got this started
this is c-sharp notebooks oh sorry let
me start that again let's launch binder
this is going to take a few minutes
because it's configuring a container for
us and the beauty of like live demos is
that this will happen as the circle
spins around but what we wanted to show
you here is that we want you to be able
to try the dotnet notebook right within
the browser we wanted you to play around
with it let me make this into c-sharp
we're going to go into samples and I
have a housing ml sample right here
right so let's walk through this
experience you can install and you get
packages right so this allows you to
customize it a Dane you get packages
that you'd like I'm going to hit shift
enter enter what this is doing is it
going to Newgate it's installing those
packages for me this will take a few
minutes but as we want you to know that
if you are using this on your site you
can install as many packages as you
would like you can use work you can
notice that we're using the ml package
we're using Auto ml and we're also
pulling that the data data frames NuGet
package as well but as that's installing
let's look through the rest of the code
so I can run through it we're able to
use our packages in the next cell as it
some of you might know notebooks have
cell by cell execution we also wanted to
make sure that people had graphs being
able to plot there so we wanted to make
sure that people are able to display
graphs scatter plots right within the
new get packages was right within the
notebook wanted to make sure that we
made this feel authentic to people who
are coming from the Python notebook
space but we also wanted to make sure
that our customers who are regularly who
a regular dotnet developers but this
also felt authentic and natural to them
so I'm going to run the next browser
maybe it's our next cell shift and turn
alright
and as you can see we have a nice table
that has been delayed we've actually
been able to display table of the
housing data we can also plot some grass
which I think would be the cool thing so
let's start looking at some cool stuff
all right let's run that again all right
so I'm going to go over to duck's
samples and housing let's pull in some
packages bear with me I am so sorry
but this should take a faster time the
next time around we've installed our
packages we're waiting for just one more
which was been successfully installed
let's run this the housing data alright
so what we wanted people to be able to
do is see the graphs and customize these
graphs authentic clean and know ok so
let's give it a moment and what we
should see in a bit is a histogram that
shows us H end of all the housing data
across California well while we're doing
that
okay let's do it one more time think the
third yes there we go it just needed one
more time if you hit it hard enough it
will happen so what we can see is that
we have a histogram that shows all the
data if you're someone coming from the
notebook space we also have support so
you can zoom in and see these things in
more detail we also wanted to make sure
that you're able you're able to do more
interesting graphs like scatter plots so
let's run this give in a moment all
right and as you can see we have a
scatter plot and you guess which state
this is California sorry I don't have a
live audience it's California as we can
see the pricing is pretty high but let's
say I wanted to zoom in a little more I
can do this I can zoom in on some of the
hot spots what this will do is I will
actually cancel out everything else so
we want that rich interactive experience
that people have come to expect and
we're looking forward to your feedback
so if you have any questions on how to
get started with the dotnet kernel that
would come at around ignite time we
won't have anything for people to try at
the moment however we do have the mind
binder experiences available right now
so if you go over to our github page and
you'll be able to launch it right there
from launching launch my browser so we
have a couple of minutes for questions I
believe when we have a chance and we can
give it a go we are ready for questions
sake well hopefully you can see us here
I brought my brand-new phone that was
really awkward well you know the first
thing that's kind of cool yeah yes yeah
this one right here mica I feel about
what you just showed us I think it's
awesome have you ever tried have you
ever tried tried net you're gonna love
this I'm reading upside down it looks
like a fairly simple way to learn and
write some c-sharp code inside your
browser without having to first create a
visual Co solution
plot plus lots of sample code aims at
new learners check it out you have a
fan yeah you really do and there's a
there's a there's a gif and I'm gonna
say gif for all of you out there
listening I'm not I will not sage if
it's not be nut butter okay of the the
guy the Australian guy going like this
two thumbs up
alright what else do we have over here
let's see wish this had been around when
I was working on bit frost by frost by
frost
a few years back looks really impressive
for dotnet open-source projects like I'm
wondering if this guy's Thor I think you
might be okay I think you might be ample
time worth hi yeah oh yeah but of course
hi for me to you alright here's another
one from John great to see the
improvements Microsoft has made in
language platform documentation I still
remember the huge stack of books from C
6.0 that's a long time ago should have
included a back brace with the product
this is pretty cool I love I love the
idea of being able to learn and read as
you go I'm personally a fan of notebooks
I'm so glad c-sharp is coming to it and
the try dotnet stuff is really cool so
if you could give people one takeaway
from your session what would it be
it would be number one can you only be
one or can I get two can you you could
give as many as you want okay this is
your session number one please go and
try the dotnet try global tome give it a
try make sure using it for your next
workshop we're looking forward to
hearing how you're doing with it
we've had people try it with workshops
that are pulling from Azure function so
I would love to see more workshops with
that also if you want to give it give
the binder experience a try let me walk
through that experience one more time so
people can look at it because I had some
technical issues because you know that's
the world so let's do that so if you go
to our github repo which is dotnet slash
trying you scroll down all our code base
you'll notice launch my binder right so
when you launch my binder what this is
doing is that it is spinning up a
container for you and you're able to
actually start running and writing that
code right within the browser so it's
pulling in the.net core SDK and all that
kind of stuff now for it to even look
nice
um look at it in the lab format which I
just think is always like a nicer way to
look at this experience I'm a fan
it's really cool I also want to point
out we do have f-sharp support I don't
know if people saw that exact is
Phillips now they live in XNA we do have
f-sharp support so if you weren't there
you go to Doc's there's an output there
is a bug which I can fix right now hit
run but this has all the nice F sharp
expectations that people will have and
my team will continue to work on that
fantastic um if you look at the C sharp
as well let's go up when look at C sharp
you will find two different samples you
have one to the housing sample and just
to give reference to this housing sample
is literally pulled out of a data
science book and Eric did a side-by-side
and was able to replicate this entire
experience right within the browser and
we also have a repo one which I should
have run to show you how we are actively
keeping track on the issues that you're
doing and we're actively trying to close
them fantastic and then wait for ignite
so you can start installing the bits on
your machine all right nice we have
another question is it possible to
integrate try dotnet with doc FX
documentation tried out net and doc
effects not at the moment now okay okay
and I think there's one more isn't this
one yeah can I take a subset of the try
dotnet code and use it to incorporate
c-sharp scripts within existing
applications Oh Jeremy good question yes
you can just look at our repo and ask us
questions and here's another one with
another awesome yeah yep Yoda
wise when it says so do what you can as
there is no try try dotnet dotnet like I
love the cool with Jupiter notebooks
like that I'm trying to like parse it
this is really good stuff okay it says
so do what you can as there is no try
try dot dotnet the cool with Jupiter
notebooks tonic
I will I will decipher that I think is a
hideout net is cool and we're also
excited about the Jupiter notebooks
experience are we ready to go to the
next yeah we have what's new in F sharp
with Philip so Philip now is it Philip
or fillers it's like doctor same with a
British accent defib

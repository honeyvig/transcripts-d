foreign
so in today's video we're gonna look at
the logic of a palindrome program so but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
a number That Remains the Same when
reversed is known as a palindrome so for
example it could be one two three two
one or triple five or it could be one
triple zero one so these are the few
examples where the numbers remain same
even when they are reversed
so moving ahead let us understand the
logic to find the palindrome of a number
so as you can see this is the piece of
code so let's understand its logic so
whenever you are entering the number
that is stored in a temporary variable
and then it checks the while condition
so while temp is not equal to zero then
it will execute this set of code so
where R is equal to R into 10 so
initially if R is equal to 0 then 0
multiplied by 10 will be 0 and that is
stored in R then again R is equal to R
plus temp module 10 so whatever is there
in the temp is module by 10 so that
again what again here we got R is equal
to 0 so 0 plus whatever we got here will
be stored back in the I
then coming to the third statement here
we have temp is equal to Temp divided by
10 so 10 divided by 10 the number what
we have in the temp is divided by 10 and
that is that result is stored back in
the temp variable
and next
let us understand the logic to find the
palindrome of a string so previously we
saw palindrome of a number now we are
going to enter the string so whatever we
are entering a string that we are
finding the length using Str Ilion
function so once we find the length of a
string that will be stored in length Lan
variable so for I is equal to 0 to I
less than n it will check if a string of
I that means the first character of a
string is not equal to the last
character of a string then it will break
that means uh it is not a palindrome if
it matches if the first character of a
string
so suppose this is the string so it will
check s is equal to n so if it is same
then it is a palindrome that means you
check whether s is equal to n then T is
equal to e r is equal to n if not then
it is not a palindrome if it is same
then for suppose let let us keep map m a
m so as you can see even when a map is
reversed it will be a palindrome of a
string right so that is the logic so let
us understand practically
so this is the number to find the
palindrome of a given number so here we
have a variable number and R is
initialized to zero and we have a temp
variable so we are asking enter a number
to check if a given number is palindrome
or not so once it enter we enter the
number that number is stored in
temporary variable so it is assigned to
Temporary variable and then we have
the while condition so while temp is not
equal to zero then it will execute this
set of statements
so we have R is equal to R into 10 so
what is our value 0 so 0 into 10 it will
store it uh that result will be stored
in our variable then again
R is equal to R plus temp module 10. so
now R is 0 so then whatever is that temp
whatever number we have entered that is
in the temp variable so that way that
number module 10 we are doing and that
result again it is stored in r
then coming to Temp so again whatever
number we have entered that number
divided by 10 so the number will be
decreased and that number again stored
in temp so finally we have an condition
if num is equal equal to R if they are
equal then the given number is palindr
else the given number is not parallel so
let's execute this
so enter a number to check if a given
number is palindrome or not so let us
enter one two three four five and check
so this is not a palindrome number why
because 1 is not equal to 5 2 is not
equal to 4 and again so this when we are
reversing it it's not equal so it's not
a panel term so let us execute once
again
so if we enter 1 triple zero one
it is a palindrome number because even
if you reverse this number it it gonna
be the same
so yeah
next Let's uh now let's execute a
program to find the palindrome of a
given string so now we are going to
enter a string
so Str uh the size is 20 and we have I
variable and we have length to find the
string length and then we have a flag
which is equal to zero
so printf enter a string so once you
enter the string we are going to find
the length of the string using Str Len
function so once you find the length of
the string we are going to store it in
the variable Len so for I is equal to 0
to I less than length it will check if
string of I is not equal to string of
length minus I minus 1.
that is if this string is
okay
yeah so what is string of I is this this
will be first
character right and string of length
minus I minus 1 that that is last
variable so it will check if this and
this is same
okay so if this and this are not equal
then it will break the condition break
if if they are same
then if flag that is if whatever we have
flag is equal to 0
then the Stringer the string is not
palindrome else the string is palindrome
so
if it is 1 then it is not a palindrome
because this the condition will not
satisfy
suppose it is string
so here s and J are not equal so the
first character and the last character
are not not equal so it will print like
a string as not palindrome okay if it is
m a m then both the characters are same
like first character and large
characteristic so then it will check
each and every character
and then print the value so let's
execute it
so enter a string
uh let's enter strength
so here as you can see it's a string
whatever is there is not a palindrome so
if you enter
from
so it's a palindrome
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on palindrome insane I hope
this session was informative and
interesting so until next time thank you

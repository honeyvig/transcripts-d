>> Did your organization
recently make a new purchase
or renew into Visual Studio subscriptions
with GitHub Enterprise?
If so, there are several ways
to make sure your organization,
and your subscribers,
are set up for success.
From using emailable domains,
to using Azure Active Directory groups,
to moving your subscribers,
there's a lot to know to
ensure successful assignment
of Visual Studio subscriptions
with GitHub Enterprise.
First, make sure the email address
you are assigning for subscribers
uses a domain that can
accept incoming email.
This allows your subscribers
to be able to receive
and accept the invitation to GitHub.
Not only that, if they aren't
able to receive emails,
then we can't communicate
important subscription updates,
such as features and new
benefits to your subscribers.
If your subscribers’ sign in email
is one that can't receive emails,
you can add a separate
notification email in the portal
when you assign the subscriptions.
Next, save yourself time
by creating groups in
Azure Active Directory
that can be used to manage subscriptions.
Once you've created the groups,
return to the admin portal,
add the Azure AD group
and choose a subscription level.

Make sure subscribers
are added to this group
as part of their onboarding
because once they're added,
they're automatically
given a subscription.
This helps you increase governance
and keeps you compliant.

Once they're removed
from that Azure AD group,
they no longer have
access to subscriptions.
To find out more about using
Azure AD in the admin portal,
visit aka.ms/VSSAADgroups.
Lastly, for those that renewed
from regular subscriptions
to Visual Studio subscriptions
with GitHub Enterprise,
you need to make sure
to move your subscribers
to the new level so they
can begin using GitHub.
To make this easy, we've
created a couple options
for moving your subscribers.
You'll simply select “move now”
and then you can choose to
move all of your subscribers
for a specific level
at once, or just a few.

Once you're done,
your subscribers will not
only have access to GitHub
but their other existing
benefits won't be reset
or interrupted in any way.

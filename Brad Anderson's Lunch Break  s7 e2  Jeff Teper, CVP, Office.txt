- It's lunchtime, and this is
Brad Anderson's lunch break.
(happy music)
Two of my favorite things about Microsoft,
are the smart people that
constantly visit campus,
and the great fleet of shuttles.
Wherever I can I try to take advantage
of both of these things,
and grab lunch with some of
the tech industry's best and brightest.
(happy music)
Today, I'll finish up my conversation
with Jeff Teper, the
creator of SharePoint.
(happy music)
(engine revving)
I was thinking about a lot of
the things that you and
I have done together.
About five years ago I
remember sending you a mail.
I was like, "Jeff, hey this whole thing
with non-Windows devices,
we gotta' do some work together here.
You know, I've got this
management stuff I'm working on.
There's things you're working on.
Let's get together and let's,
- Yeah.
- Let's get a plan for how productivity
and management come together.
You remember when you forwarded
that message to Rajesh,
what Rajesh said?
- Yeah.
- I can still remember
your exact comment was,
"Brad's a Windows guy."
You remember this?
- I do, I do.
- Yes, I'm sorry I was a
little snippy that meeting,
but I was, you know, "Why
am I talking to Brad?"
- He said, "No, Brad's a Windows guy."
- Yeah.
- And I said, "No, Brad's a business guy.
"Brad wants to build the product
"that customers want."
You had a set of
competitors or alternatives
that had a pretty crappy set of
productivity, apps.
- apps.
- And we had competitors
that didn't really
have the manageability,
and so besides being the
thing our customers wanted,
it was sort of a win-win.
- [Brad] Okay so we're gonna' play a game
called This or That.
- Sure.
- So I'm gonna' give you
a couple of descriptions,
and I'm gonna' give you a phrase or a word
and you're gonna' tell me, is it this,
is it that, or is it both.
- [Jeff] Okay.
- Okay, the two terms
we're gonna' work with are
Malware, or am I talking about Minecraft.
So Malware or Minecraft.
- Malware or Minecraft, okay.
- Way too many people in your workforce
have it running in the background.
- Uh, Minecraft.
- Your kids probably
downloaded it on your phone
when you weren't looking.
- Malware.
I answered both those wrong.
They both could be right, but.
- Millions of people all over the world
are working on it right now.
- Uh, Malware.
- At least it gets kids
interested in technology.
- Minecraft.
- [Brad] (laughs) Okay, it's both,
could be.
- That could be bumped.
- There's a huge secondary economy
for people who are good at building it.
- Oh, well that's, gosh.
I have to pick one?
- I heard that your first
job in the software industry
was writing what, a vehicle
simulator when you were 14?
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah, wow!
Yeah, wow, you really did dig deep.
(laughter)
So my Dad was a aerospace engineer,
and he had these algorithms
for vehicle simulation
that he'd done in Fortran, in a PDP-11.
And he did some work on the side
from the company he worked with,
and I think he probably charged himself
out a hundred dollars an hour,
and he paid me like $7 an hour
to port the Fortran from the PDP-11
to the TRS-80 Model III.
- Oh my word!
- And Fortran, whatever it was,
Fortran IV or Fortran 77.
- Yep.
- And so I'd never, I had no
idea what these algorithms did.
I didn't know what the outputs
they were supposed to do.
But there were some subtle differences,
as there always are in compilers,
with your data types and so forth,
where I had to run it on the PDP-11,
I had to run it on the TRS-80 Model III,
and make sure that I guess,
the car didn't crash.
- And this is at 14?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.
- There's a ton of upper level math
involved with all that movement.
- Yes, matrix algebra.
- You don't--
- I didn't really understand it.
- Just little stuff like that.
- I got it correct, my Dad
fixed a couple of bugs,
but he did pay me, so
I assume that must mean
that I did do it.
- Well, 7 bucks an hour.
- When you and I were 14,
you know what,
- Yeah.
- I was delivering newspapers
- Yes.
- When I was 14, making a buck an hour.
- Yeah.
- Fun stat for you, we've had
a quarter billion downloads
of OneDrive on iOS and Android.
And the--
- Quarter billion.
- The Google Play store,
which is of course
the biggest store, 'cuz they have the most
mobile devices.
- devices.
- [Jeff] But 800,000
people rated us 4.4 rating,
higher than the home team
- Awesome.
- of Google Drive on that device,
which we're really proud of.
It's been really great to see,
and I think the things that people like
about OneDrive are the rich collaboration
capabilities with Office.
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- We're starting to do unique
things with intelligence.
- You know, what you and
I have talked about is,
how do we build this in a
way that is loved by users
and trusted by IT,
- Yeah, yeah yeah.
- and nail them both,
- That's a tricky thing.
- Is actually really hard.
- Yeah, and our teams, and this is good,
our teams fight sometimes so our users
and IT departments don't have to.
Because we will push each other,
- Correct.
- And we'll say, "Brad,
this dialogue that came up,
"We gotta' do something about it."
- I know exactly what
you're talking about.
- And you say, "Yeah, but
if we just blow past it,
"here's the risk that you're,"
And that challenge that
we do on each other
leads to, I think, some of our best work
where we balance usability and security.
(happy music)
- [Brad] Well Jeff, let's make sure we
make this a regular occasion,
so you know--
- Yeah, glad to do it.
- I know you've gotta'
pick other people up
in the shuttle a lot, you
know, don't quit your day job.
- Alright man,
- Sounds great,
- Good to see you.
- Bye!
- Alright, take care now.
- See you buddy.
- Next time, on Brad
Anderson's Lunch Break.
- Four of five years
ago, I was at a function.
I was introduced to an elected member
of Parliament in New Zealand.
And someone introduced me
as a Global Cloud Expert.
And this dude said, without a word of lie,
"Oh, you study the weather do you?"

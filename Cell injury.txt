hi Venus I'm back here with some stuff
related to general pathology so before
going into this topic as we are humans
every day we have challenges every day
we have surprises can be a positive one
or can be a negative one but you always
should follow this theory the challenges
are not supposed to paralyze you they
are supposed to help you to discover who
you are what you are capable of when you
get a challenge in front of you then you
will know the real capability of
yourself only when you have tough tasks
in front of you and if you achieve them
you will really get to know what you are
to the people around you so now you feel
have any challenge in front of you that
can be personal or professional let's
take it let's fight for it let's let's
it hear it then you will show yourself
to the world what you are here for so
please try to implement all these good
aspects in your preparation so coming to
today's topic that is Sellinger in the
cell injury is something like the
traumatic injury for us like when you
when you have a stimulus something like
a stress and when you are not able to
bear the stress then you will start
adapting to the stress even when the
stress is too increased even then after
in distress is English then you may
cause some reversible damage and even
then if it is more more of intensity
then it may lead to some irreversible
damage this is something similar like
the situation to the human life so cell
injuries can be basically due to
modification in the internal or in the
external environment but the cell
responds to the stress so the cell
responds to the external stress or the
internal stress by the host factors or
by the factors of the agent the agent
which is causing the stress so either
can a stress or can a pathological
stimulus lead to following changes in
the cell the change one is the
adaptation the change two is
irreversible or a reversible damaged and
the end it may lead to the death of the
cell so these are the changes which are
based upon the intensity or the duration
of the stimulus that can be
physiological or a pathological so what
happens in cell injuries so when the
cells are getting injured there will be
damage to the mitochondria as you know
that the mitochondria is called as
powerhouse of the cell which generates
the ATP so whenever there is no
mitochondria there will be drop in the
ATP so whenever there is drop in the ATP
okay and lysis of the mitochondria most
of the cell contents which are present
in the mitochondria the leech is outside
so whenever there is drop in ATP or drop
in the oxygen levels the cell leads to
anaerobic and further leads to damaged
by the release of the free radicals
as you know I have already discussed
about the reversible irreversible cell
injury slide so reversible type of
reversible how you can identify
reversible irreversible by seeing and
microscope this is a most commonly asked
question which are the following is a
reversible cell damage which would have
fallen seen in a reversible cell damage
so simple logical explanation simple way
to handle the things is intensity means
normal cell will become versed in
reversible injury and will become too
versed in irreversible injury intensity
varies the second one easy to remember
in most of the cases your reversible
smelling your reversible cell injury
there will be swelling okay there will
be swelling swelling of all the articles
you can see you can see the mitochondria
the mitochondria there is swelling we
can see in the cell membrane there is
swelling and you can see in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes there
is swelling
okay and next one is irreversible
so you reversible damage is of more
intensity in most of the cases it will
be disturbed or disorganized you can see
there will be apart from swelling which
is there in reversible there will be
lots of large densities accumulation
okay large densities of the bodies are
accumulated we can see these vacuoles
and the large density of the bodies that
are accumulated you can see there is
disruption of the cell membrane
apart from lysis which is of severe case
there will be dispersed ribosomes the
ribosomes are disorganized okay okay so
all these are the basic differences you
have to know the next comes it goes the
same okay you will have disturbed you
will have ruptured and of course t3
these three terms are very very
important in examination
different because we have seen n number
of questions in these areas and the
questions were passed recently Penna
kosis okay is condensed form okay you
can see the nuclear material is
condensed okay is condemned excess is
fragmentation you can see so many facts
of nuclear membrane and of course you
know the meaning of lysis which ruptures
and the material will get lysis or to
something called as dissolution okay so
please do make a note about these three
terms which are very very important
the next comes is the Salinger right the
cell injury cell injury can be either
physical the theology can be physical
the etiology can be chemical okay
physical chemical or can be infections
few infections lead to cell injury and
in few cases it can be genetic because
of genes also okay so these are the
primary four causes for different
categories of cell injury but the most
common cause of cell injury is hypoxia
okay as everyone knows the most common
cause of cell injuries hypoxia hypoxia
means hypo means less boxia means less
oxygen okay less what sir wherever you
have lack sources and what is going to
happen so this can be given as a flow
chart based questions on you okay so
whenever you have less oxygen there will
be decreasing in the ATP generation okay
they will be decreasing in the ATP
generation so what happens when there is
decreasing in the ATP generation either
the calcium which is present outside
will increase that is cytosolic calcium
linkage or when the ATP is dropped down
there will be more oxygen free radicals
available in the
or the ADP generation for synthesis of
phospholipids the synthesis of
phospholipids will decrease because
phospholipids are the primary contents
of your cell memory of all the cell
memories whenever you there is a
decreasing in the phospholipids there
will be no membranes so when there is
decreasing in the synthesis of
phospholipids okay okay so there will be
no proper memory information on the cell
because phospholipid is the primary
content that leads to cell memory and
darkness okay so that is one side right
the second side when there is increasing
in the cytoplasmic calcium levels these
cytoplasmic calcium levels will cause
increasing in the calcium in the
mitochondria so most of your
pathological changes or cell injuries
are associated with an ion this is again
a question iron which is responsible for
most of the cell injuries or any type of
cell injury is primarily the catcher
primarily the calcium the answer for
this is cancer
so whenever you have increasing in the
cytoplasmic calcium levels as well as
mitochondrion calcium levels this
calcium is going to activate
phospholipid s and Gen or it's going to
activate protease enzymes it's going to
activate all the enzymes so whenever
these enzymes are active is going to
activate protease enzyme is going to
break the protein structures
phospholipid s is going to break the
phospholipid so it's going to break and
and cause damage to the membrane cause
damage to the lipid production cause
damage to the cytoskeleton leading to
the cell membrane damage has already
discussed that the whenever there is
oxygen radicals okay so oxygen radicals
are going to cause damage to the DNA as
well as the lipid peroxidation aiding to
the cell membrane damage so finally the
end product of hypoxia is after lots of
pathophysiological changes it's leads to
memorandum s so that membrane damage can
be any of areas so whenever the membrane
is damaged all these enzymes which are
present inside the cells
to come out and they will be increasing
in the serum and gem estimation okay so
most of the enzymes serum and gem
estimation can be done most of the
enzymes they increase think is because
there will be liberation of
intracellular in chips okay so they may
lead to the cell that because the
membrane is damaged the cell death or
the nuclear membrane is damaged there
will be the nuclear changes this is the
basic pathophysiology outline
pathophysiology of Hoppus on the next
comes is as I was telling that
adaptation okay the first change first
stress to the cell is adaptation so all
these categories that comes under
adaptations one is it tropi okay one is
a trophy second one is hypertrophy
hypertrophy means there will be
increasing in the size of the cell
hyperplasia there will be increasing in
the number of cells okay metaplasia
there will be change in the shape of the
Sun okay you can see this is a normal
cell because of some stimulus there is
changing in the type and the shape of
the cell that is called as metaplasia
but of course you know this dysplastic
changes of dysplasia
okay few examples you have to make a
note ll regularly they may ask you
simple definition of what is hypertrophy
what is hyperplasia
but they may ask an example based
questions okay so these are the examples
which have a little bit of controversy
but you need to conclude with these
answers so regularly a pregnancy uterus
comes under which category okay it comes
under hypertrophy it has hyperplasia but
it is very very minimal hypertrophy okay
the breast tissue of a woman during
pregnancy and puberty okay it comes both
both okay
sorry it's not drug it is during
pregnancy and puberty it comes both okay
it is an example of both hypertrophy as
well as hyper plane
but if you are talking only about the
lactating tissue of the breast during
the pregnancy or gross pregnancy
it is only hypertrophic so please do
make a note about three examples because
these are the examples which are
regularly asked as a controversial
things rest on I hope you can easily
madness the next comes as I was
stressing you more that okay these are
the comments sequences right so so
metaplasia is the exchange of normal
epithelium for other epithelium okay and
preferably the key word is it is
reversible because means once the
stimulus is given it is something like
your reversible pulpitis wondersteam
once the stimulus is given there will be
pal paddles once the stimulus is removed
there will it reverse back to the normal
condition means once the stimulus is
there the epithelium changes to a
different type once the stimulus is
removed the epithelium come back student
so it is called as a reversible
metaplasia is called as reversible so
some key points and notices that you
need to add related to manipulation
metaplasia is something like a normal
cell okay modifies into a different cell
this is called as metaplasia if a cell
converts like this to this visitors also
called as metaplasia but it is basically
reversible means it reverses back after
the removal of the stimulus similarly
like your reversible vampiress so key
points to bed at point one metaplasia is
thought to arise by reprogramming of
stem cells to differentiate along a new
pathway rather than a phenotype exchange
of already differentiated cells okay the
key word and this is reprogramming of
the same stones is a question which was
previously asked okay it's a direct line
that is taken from the text of it
okay so reprogramming of the stem cells
is is nothing but this is nothing but
the metaplasia
and of course it's a question that is
asked in few exams that is it is a
reversible condition okay so what
happens if metaplasia stimulus is for
longer duration
of time for example your reversible
pulpitis stimulus is for longer duration
of time then it will be converted into
irreversible pulpitis so the stimulus is
of longer duration of time it is going
to convert it into the next level that
is displaced yeah and there are two
types of multipliers one is epithelial
and mesenchymal but if you compare the
conditions epithelial matter places are
more common epithelium matter places are
more out of epithelial matter places
columnar cell converted into squamous
cell is more calm regularly they may ask
you which is most common epithelial my
top lashes are most common in epithelial
metaplasia s-- the conversion of a
column inner cell to that of the
squamous cell is the most common okay so
we'll learn some some examples which are
mainly conserved or mainly mainly ask
for the dental students okay so as
already told there two types of
metaplasia s-- one is epithelial and
mesenchymal so coming to the epithelial
metaplasia
okay so regularly occurrence of this
epithelial metaplasia like the squamous
changes again that occur in the
respiratory epithelium of the smokers
okay
respiratory epithelium of the smokers
normally you will have your columnar
epithelium with the cilia in the in the
respiratory system but due to smoking
this is going to convert it into
squamous epithelium okay the columnar
epithelium is going to convert into
squamous epithelium okay so that's that
that's an important example of a person
who is smoking okay so so you can see
here the normal bronchial epithelium so
the normal bronchial epithelium is is
columnar epithelium with the cilia which
is going to convert it into the squamous
epithelium after few days and which is
further going to convert it into
carcinoma that is with the dysplastic
changes this is the best example of
squamous metaplasia so other other
example of squamous metaplasia I will
will be having some textbook reading
related to this slide is vitamin A
related stuff that can be a the
deficiency or excess of vitamin A lead
to squamous metaplasia either excess or
deficiency because this is again a most
commonly asked question related to your
vitamins which vitamin deficiency or
excess may causes metaplasia squamous
metaplasia the answer is vitamin A and
of course we we have learned
okay that is Barrett's esophagus so
Barrett's esophagus regularly in the use
of fakirs okay so in the ease of a goes
you have your squamous epithelium okay
you have your squamous epithelia but due
to secretion of assets the squamous
epithelium is being replaced by the
columnar epithelium okay so you can see
this bio this is a biopsy often lower
okay particle this is I get a question
lower half of the esophagus only will
show this Barrett's esophagus with a
chronic grd it shows columnar epithelium
that is columnar metaplasia which is
called as Barrett's esophagus and of
course it contains the glowblade cells
okay okay so regularly what is what is
the epithelium the squamous epithelium
is typically of normal use of aegisub
regularly we used to have squamous
epithelium but due to acid secretion in
that area to protect the cells from the
acid secretion because glowblade cells
are the responsible for secretion of
mucus and which acts as a protection
from acid so the squamous epithelium
which is original they will be converted
into the columnar epithelium so this is
the best example you can see is the
lower part of the esophagus regularly
line by the squamous epithelium but due
to acid secretion to protect the cells
this has been replaced by the columnar
epithelium and this area of lower
esophagus which has been replaced from
the squamous epithelium to the columnar
epithelium is called as the Diocese of
Vegas and the same goes
with many other areas okay so there are
many other areas your urinary bladder is
again an example of the squamous
metaplasia okay so squamous metaplasia
anyway will have a textbook reading of
examples they may not go very deep into
the concept things may be they may ask a
depth oriented question related to
Barrett's esophagus okay or maybe maybe
apathy liam of the metaplasia they can
ask but mostly they may not ask you the
urinary system okay but most of these
metaplasia will lead to carcinomas in
the future okay it can be your Barrett's
esophagus which will be converted into
high risk of converting into
adenocarcinoma fees of haggis or you can
see this particular type of metaplasia
which can lead to squamous cell
carcinoma in future so as already said
like epithelial metaplasia and the
second one is nice and common metaplasia
epithelial metaplasia
are more common okay so in epithelial
metaplasia you have squamous metaplasia
and columnar metaplasia okay so as far
as metaplasia is the example is chronic
smokers okay and and if you want you can
add this vitamin A deficiency or excess
may lead to squamous metaplasia okay so
that's that's again a most commonly
asked question for the dental students
okay and if you want you can add this
uterine okay you can add this squamous
metaplasia can be seen a new trained
endo cervix particular in the case of
prolapse or in the old individuals it is
going to get replaced the original it is
lined by simple columnar epithelium
later it is going to replaced by the
squamous epithelium the next comes is
the columnar metaplasia
okay when compared to scram is
metaplasia the column in our metaplasia
is going to be less common so the best
examples of columnar metaplasia
are yes I have already discussed that is
the Barrett's esophagus okay the
Barrett's esophagus
is one smoking it is promised metaplasia
whereas chronic bronchitis is a columnar
metaplasia okay so if you want you can
add this examples but the highlighted
one are the most commonly asked
questions the next one we are done with
the epithelial metaplasia s' the next
part is nice and caramel meta pleasures
okay the mesenchymal meta places are of
two types one is osseous metaplasia and
cartilaginous metaplasia s' so if you
want you can add these examples to your
notes they can be given as a questions
so next level of metaplasia is already
discuss that is dysplasia dysplasia
clearly gives this disorganized
disorganized self development is called
as dysplasia sometimes it is also called
as atypical hyperplasia hyperplasia we
know but hyperplasia is an organized one
but here it is atypical hyperplasia it's
not normal hyperplasia it is an abnormal
hyperplasia and of course the
characteristic features that are seen in
the cells or in the epithelium are very
very important there will be increasing
in the number of layers of epithelium
the number of cells increase the number
of layers increase disorganized
arrangement of cells from the basal
layer to the superficial layer can be
seen loss of basal polarity of course
you know this is a trademarked feature
of carcinoma lots of basal priority
means the nucleus move away from the
basement membrane okay
there will be cellular and nuclear
pleomorphic some different nucleus
different cells are of different shape
different nucleus of different shape of
course this is a star trademark question
okay in this plastic features there will
be increasing in the nuclear cytoplasm
ratio there will be nuclear hypo
chromaticism strain different strains
for different nucleus of different cells
increasing in the mitotic activity so
all these are the futures which are seen
in the dysplastic cells and it is a very
very important area to be focused the
next comes is the difference between the
metaplasia and displaced you have
learned so much related to
metabolization dysplasia now just make a
note about difference metaplasia is
reversible metaplasia is changed from
one cell to other type of cell whereas
dysplasia is the extinction of
metaplasia when your stimulus is
extended more than it will be dysplasia
okay so the simple definition change of
one cell epithelium or mesenchymal cell
to others and is called as metaplasia
disorganized cell development may be
accompanied after hyperplasia or
metaplasia is called as dysplasia
metaplasia is of two types that is
epithelial metaplasia and mesenchymal
metaplasia epithelial metaplasia is more
common when compared to the maze and
common metaplasia whereas dysplasia is
only epithelial type there is no me sand
camel type only epithelial tissue is
most commonly affected you can write
down the examples okay the next one
cellular changes there will be matured
cellular development okay here
everything is disorganized cell
development glioma fit some nuclear hypo
chromatids of mitosis loss of basal
power all are disorganized here they're
well organized because there's they're
giving it try to save the system right
so it's reversible
once the stimulus is removed it is
reversible okay so it will progress to
the next level I think these are the
simple differences okay which are very
very important in examination point of
view the next comes I'm going to talk
about necrosis in detail we'll have some
rapid fire and discussion in our
respective groups but this is completely
a solidly textbook based analysis so
simple I hope you know the definition
necrosis can be defined as localized
area of death of tissue followed by
disintegration of cells by hydrolytic
enzymes that is important hydrolytic is
important so there are five types of of
course there even special types of
necrosis but there are five types of
necrosis that is the coagulative
necrosis liquefaction necrosis
Katia's necrosis fat necrosis fibrin or
necrosis
so out of which the coagulative necrosis
is is the most common most common type
of necrosis is quiet or necrosis okay
the most common type of necrosis
followed by irreversible focal injury
most commonly due to hypoxia this
coagulate or necrosis is most commonly
due to hypoxia that is the cell injury
okay and it is less often because of
bacteria or the chemical agent it's the
most often due to hypoxia the organs
which are affected by this are heart
kidney and spleen okay so this example
is very very important heart kidney and
spleen next one is the liquefaction
necrosis
so liquefaction necrosis occurs most
commonly by an ischemic injury or
bacterial or fungal infection converted
into semi solid fluid like material and
you can write down the examples that is
the brain infection of a brain and
abscess cavity or the best example of
liquefaction necrosis next one is
cassius necrosis
so Katia's necrosis you can most
commonly seen in the case of
tuberculosis we'll learn about that okay
you'll learn how soft Chebarkul hodcha
burcu what is difference between soft
and hard tubercle all these are
regularly asked questions in your ug as
well as in the entrance examination so
cassius necrosis is most commonly
related to the TB and it is a
combination of both coagulant or and
liquefaction necrosis the next comes is
the fact necrosis means fat necrosis
occurs in the tissues or in the bodies
or in the areas where there is more fat
so it is a special form of cell death
which is mainly concerned with fat rich
anatomical areas - traumatic fat
necrosis of the breast because that
breast is an area of more amount of fat
okay and pancreatic a crude acute
pancreas you can see
FAK necrosis of breast necrosis and fact
nickel bang cleared
acute pancreas are the best example of
fat necrosis the last comes is fibroid
fibroid is something like a material
it's more like a material fiber no it is
casting by deposition of fibrin like
material which has the staining
properties of fibrin okay so where does
they come most of the immune complex
mediated reactions like autoimmune
diseases all these diseases hypertension
and practicals are the examples of the
fiber out necrosis most commonly they
will ask you the examples of each type
of necrosis as a question the next comes
we are done with the necrosis ok I'll be
posting another video related to
apoptosis okay at the sequence of the
events that takes place video will be
posted immediately but this is the basic
difference between the necrosis and
apoptosis apoptosis is a programmed cell
death it's it's made programmed cell
death whereas this is a disintegration
by hydrolytic enzymes okay the causative
the most common cause for necrosis as of
course the quality necrosis is hypoxia
whereas here it can be due to a
pathological change or a physiological
change which leads to the programmed
cell death
okay so morphological differences are
most important whereas in the necrosis
you can see inflammation is present
whereas apoptosis is a programmed one
there is no inflammation there is no
activation of inflammation in necrosis
there will be death of HSN cells also
which are surrounding but there will be
death of only single cell which is
programmed the programmed cell only dies
there will be cell string case here
whereas in the necrosis because of
inflammation everything atom and every
formation there will be cell swelling
initially okay
there will be cytoplasmic blebs on the
memory which leads to the breakage right
and here the cytoplasm is totally
disturbed there it is just will have
blurbs
so you can see a pop talking bodies can
be seen here damaged cell organelles can
be seen here the nuclear membrane or the
nuclear material is condensed
here it is totally disturbed
phagocytosis of the hope TOC bodies
occurs by macrophages here okay
here the Deborah's is removed by the
macrophages so molecular changes are
already discussed because I will be
discussing all these changes in another
video please do have have a quickly look
or this differences which can be asked
as a question for you so the next comes
is the gangrene okay you need to learn
something about gangrene there are two
types of pathological changes
- gangrene and second one is
pathological
calcification okay
so we'll try to learn about the basic
definition of Kangaroo some
pathophysiological changes in the
gangrene and types of Gagarin's so
gangrene is a necrosis of a tissue
associated with superadded purification
most commonly followed by coagulative
necrosis means lack of blood supply it's
just an extension of it then it crosses
the process the coagulative necrosis
process okay so I mean this this
fortification can be primarily initiated
by the bacteria which can resulting in
Masuda to necrosis so there different
types of example even your normal canker
Morris and everything comes under
gangrenous status around the mouth there
is there is something called as
gangrenous appendicitis so all these
comes out together like it's it's
necrosis forward by necrosis the battery
additional will lead to the Putra
fication of the particular area lead to
the formation of a ganglion so coming to
the dry gangrene okay dry gangrene
this is a form of gangrene which begins
in the distal part of the limp which is
most commonly seen in the distal part of
the limb and the very important aspect
about this dry gangrene there will be
line of demarcation okay a line of
demarcation is formed at the point
between the gangrenous part and the
viable part you can see the line of
demarcation
okay and you will you can see some black
color right this Blackard is basically
due to hydros and disulfide the hydrogen
dry sulfide produced by the bacteria
will react with the iron that is present
in the blood to form iron sulfate which
is dark in color okay
the next comes is the vet ganglion pack
gangrene occurs naturally in the moist
Eastridge and organs such as pole or
organs such as lungs mouth
cervix and everything okay the two other
examples of bad gangrened clinically are
diabetic foot in diabetes you can see
both the get both wet as well as try but
diabetic foot exclusion is a wet
gangrene example T so this wet gangrene
is basically due to hide Lucas content
okay which allows the growth of bacteria
so bacteria will grow because at the end
after necrosis
gap gangrene is something like which
allows the bacteria to grow in that
particular area and you can see bed
suppose the patient who are like
bedridden for a longer duration of time
due to the pressure of the sites like
sacrum buttock and heel there is chances
of occurrence of bad kangaroo so wet
gangrene dollars basically due to the
due to the blockage of the venous
returns okay due to the block is of the
venous returns okay so and followed by
the wet gangrene
okay the next comes is the gas can grab
the third one is gas kangaroo gas
gangrene is a special type of wet
gangrene
it's again a tire itself it's a wet
gangrene but special type of wet
gangrene which is produced only by the
gas forming bacteria this gas forming
back to the best example is Clostridium
okay so I hope you remember your gas
gangrene
in your general surgery also right so
gas gangrene is mainly concerned with
the Clostridium so they can ask you one
is first one is dry second one is wet
and third one is gas gas is nothing but
it's a type of wet gangrene
so the most common sight the most
commonly seen in the limbs and
extremities it is most commonly seen in
the wet areas that is well okay so it's
most commonly due to the arterial
occlusion its most formally dodol
occlusion of both mainly by the venous
Freitas blockage of the venous writtens
macroscopically the organ is dry shunkan
and black here the organ is moist soft
Solem wrote and dark both are dark here
it is black here it is dark a
purification is limited to a very little
blood supply it's limited due to a very
little blood supply his mark due to
snuffing of organ with the blood and if
you see the line of demarcation present
clearly present no clear line of
demarcation in the case of red kangaroo
bacteria failed to survive in this area
because of lack of oxygen or limitation
so the supply of blood here the bacteria
will be numerous okay so this this
particular node was added basing upon
talking about the diabetic things more
in concern because I've seen many
questions related to a diabetic kangaroo
okay so gang gram the foot is the most
common location for tissue necrosis okay
the foot is the most common location for
occurrence of the gangrene and foot
gangrene is 50 times more prevalent in
diabetics compared with non diabetics
individual more chances that not too
particularly above 40 year or face so
they can ask you a case based question
okay a patient with this necrosis of a
foot again they may give you a is of
over 40 years or 50 years so the
diagnosis is the diabetic foot or the
patient is diagnosed with the diabetes
because more they have more chances of
occurrence of the diabetic foot
okay well the dry form is caused by the
dry form that is dry gangrene from is
caused by the large results block is due
to sclerosis dry is due to sclerosis
okay try is due to the sclerosis because
we have already known dry is basically
due to arterial occlusion and what is
believed to be a late manifestation what
is believed to be laced manifestation of
microangiopathic I hope you remember
that diabetic complications like after
which is one of one of which is Angela
this micro ng over this so diabetic
patients will have both dry as well as
but if they ask in specific go for the
vet because it's a late complication but
you can see dry gangrene in diabetic
patient also but dry gangrene in
diabetic patient is mainly due to the
three roses both see this both may occur
in diabetics but very but a small vessel
disease is more common and it's directly
associated with the diabetic vascular D
arrangements dry gangrene occurs mostly
in diabetic patients with sclerosis
whereas wet gangrene's develop basically
acid late complications okay so if they
specifically asked diabetic foot go for
wet gangrene if they ask diabetic the
chances that both dry as well as but
canvasing but if you ask if they ask the
etiology of red kangaroo and diabetic
patient the answer is sclerosis okay the
answer is sclerosis and wet gangrene
it's normal okay so please do make a
note about these difference because this
is an area of controversy again so last
but not the least is calcifications i
hope you're very good at calcification
so regularly what they do is they may
ask you the difference between
metastatic and dystrophic calcification
so easy to remember dystrophic has D
word okay so it is DNA so dystrophic
calcification
the calcifications which are occurring
in the dead and degenerated okay when an
individual is dead when the individual
is not working
the calcium metabolism is normal when
the calcium metabolism is normal the
serum levels are the calcium are normal
everything is normal and when the
individual or a cell is dead
it is generally irreversible so all are
interlinked dystrophic can be seen and
dead and degenerated dystrophic is seen
when the calcium metabolism is normal
and the serum levels of the calcium is
normal as it is in the dead and
degenerated it is irreversible you
cannot you cannot make a dead cell
normal right
so that is disturbing calcification so
remember only dystrophic matter static
is opposite so metastatic calcification
can be seen in normal tissues there will
be tea arranged disorganized or change
calcium metabolism there will be
increasing in the calcium levels and
probably it will be reversible so all
dead and degenerated examples will come
under dystrophic very easy dead end
degenerated because already said it is
dead and already all live examples okay
you can see adenoma is a live cell okay
you can see hyper hypervitaminosis D is
a live cell metastatic carcinoma is a
live one so most of these syndromes and
everything are live ones where as you
can see here all are dead dead parasites
in fact dead necrosis dead thrown by
dead certain tumors which are dead so
most of the examples easy to identify
the examples most of disturbing examples
are dead examples and most of the
metastatic 8 examples are conditional
examples which are live cells so apart
from this I just want to add a note
about our dental related stuff related
to this calcifications
so of course you I hope you remember
your pulp stones the different types of
bulbs true bulbs fall so anyway we're
going to learn this either in the
histology or either in the inner orbits
but there will be some pulp cells pulp
cells which are dead okay so when there
is accumulation of calcium in these pulp
cells which are
that has already discussed dystrophic
calcification is seen the tendon
degenerated and some pulp cells are dead
the calcifications that are curse in
those pulp cells are called as
dystrophic calcification which are
nothing but pulp stones okay which are
nothing but pulp stones how you can see
them they are not inner calcified masses
they can be seen either in the coronal
part or in the radicular part okay and
they down up into two that appears quite
normal in their architecture externally
but on radiography you can see this
dystrophic or calcifications are the
pulp stones
okay the next comes is a little bit
application part of the pulp related
necrosis so in most of the cases the
pulp necrosis is coagulative necrosis
because lack of blood supply or damage
to the blood supply or trauma to the
dead zone because if you see a least
class 4 which is a necrotic pulp due to
trauma in his class 4 is a necrotic pulp
due to trauma is basically due to the
loss of blood supply the blood supply is
lost
whenever the blood supply is lost there
will be huh foxier let's call the squag
later necrosis but pulp shows both the
types of necrosis that is liquefaction
and coagulate oh but most 4 - the
coagulate or necrosis
yes thank you - I'll try my best to post
another video related to the mechanism
of apoptosis because I feel like that is
the most trickiest area and this
particular show ok stay positive stay
blessed stay at home work hard

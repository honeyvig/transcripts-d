hey everyone i am vivo khandelwal and i
welcome you all to yet another exciting
video from simply learn in this session
we will be discussing c c-sharp
dependency injection however before we
begin make sure you have subscribed to
youtube channel and clicked on the bell
icon below so you never miss an update
from simply learn's youtube channel
let's look at the agenda for today's
topic
we shall begin a session with an
introduction to dependency injection
then we will discuss the ways to
implement the dependency injection
first we will discuss the constructor
dependency injection with the code
implementation
then we will have a look at
property dependency injection and then
at last
we have method dependency injection
finally we will conclude this session
with some advantages of dependency
injection
so without any further ado let's get
started with what is dependency
injection
dependency injection is a software
design pattern that enables the creation
of loosely coupled softwares
di is an excellent method for reducing
tight coupling between software
components
di also allows us to more effectively
handle future updates and other
complexities in our product
the goal of dependency injection is to
make code more manageable now let's
discuss
what are the other ways to implement
dependency injection
we can implement dependency injection in
three ways
constructor dependency injection
property dependency injection and method
dependency injection
let's start with constructor dependency
injection
the constructor dependence injection
usually has only one parameterized
constructor
there is no default constructor in
constructor dependency
we need to pass the specified value
during object creation
we can use the injection component
anywhere within this class
let's try to implement it in the
correlator
we have already included some system
libraries which will be needed in this
code
now let's start this code with the name
space
property
injection
we will introduce an
interface text
here we will be declaring
a function void
print
then
we will be creating a class
format
which will answer to text
now we will write a definition
for the print function
so
public
void
print
console
dot
right line
and we will type in
subscribe
to
simply learn
now
let's write a constructor
so
public
class
constructor injection
then we will create a private interface
text
for the text interface
then public
constructor
injection
and we will pass on
text as t1
we will store t1
in this dot underscore text
and then
we will call
print function
underscore
text
dot
print basically whenever this function
will be run it will call its constructor
then that constructor will automatically
take the text as its input and then
print the same text
now
let's write the class
constructor
and we will write
the main function so static
void
main
string
args
then
we will call constructor injection
and make an object cs
new
instructor injection in brackets
new
format
then
we will use this object to call print
function
and then
the console
dot
read key
this will close the function
whenever we press any key
let's save it ctrl s
and then run it
as you can see when this function is run
the constructor was called and that
constructor has initiated
the text t1
then this t1 is caused to print this
this t1 was

now let's get back to our slide
next up the property dependency
injection
the property is typically used when we
need parameter less constructor
it could even work without changing the
object's state
let's try it in the code editor
let's start with creating a interface
so public
interface
i
notification
action
void
act
on
notification
and we will give it the parameter as
string
message
next we will
have a class
simple
then we will call
the interface
i notification action
task
equals to
null
then
public
void
notify
function
then i notification action
this will be 80
comma
string
messages
and then
we will store this 80 in task so this
dot task
equals
80.
and then
[Music]
task
will call
act
on notification
messages
now
we will start a class
event
log
writer
i
notification action
then
public
void
add
notification
and
string messages
here we can write anything which we want
to print out
so console
dot
right line
and we will write
click
on
the bell icon
to get
notifications
next we will write a class
program
now we will call the main function so
static
void
main
string
args
we will call
event
logwriter
and
make
an object elw equals to
new
event log writer
now
simple
add
is equals to
new
simple
and then this will call the notify
function
with elw
comma
to
log
now we will write
console
dot
read key
this function helps to terminate the
code with a single key press
let's run this code
as you can see it is printing click on
the bell icon to get notification
now let's go back to our slides
at last
its method dependency injection
we only need to pass the dependency in
the method
when using method injection
we do not use constructor injection
because it would create a dependent
object every time the class is initiated
let's try this in the code editor
let's start with the namespace
property
injection
we will write up an interface
public
interface
i
set
void
print
then
we will call a class
so public
class
service
i
set then we will write the definition
for the print function
[Music]
so public
void
print
in console
dot write line
and then we will print
now
we will call
public
class
client
we will call private
i set
and underscore
i set
public
void
run
i set
serve
and we will store this serve in
underscore i set
so this
dot
underscore i set
is equals to
serve
then we will write
console
dot
write line
and we will print
start
and then
this
dot
i set
dot print
so first it will print start
and then
it will run the print function which
will print
the above text which is print dot dot
dot dot
we will write up a class
method
now we will write up the main function
so public
static
void
main
then client
cn
equals to
new
client
then we will run
cn
dot run
in brackets
new
cervic
then we will call
console
dot
read key
to terminate the code
when it reads the key
now let's save it
and run this code
as you can see it's first
writing this command start and then it
is calling the sprint function which
then prints this print
statement
let's get back to our slides
finally
let's conclude this tutorial with some
advantages of dependency injection
first up
dependency injection helps in reducing
the class coupling
next up
it increases
the reusability of the code
next the dependency injection helps to
improve code maintainability
at last the dependency injection makes
it feasible to conduct unit testing

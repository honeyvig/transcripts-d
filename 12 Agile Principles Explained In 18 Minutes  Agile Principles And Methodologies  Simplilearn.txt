hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on 12 agile principles at simply
learn in this tutorial we are going to
explore the core principles of agile
methodologies which is a customer
Centric approach to software development
it is rooted in agile Manifesto that
these principle prioritize early and
frequent software delivery adaptability
to changing requirements and
collaboration between stakeholders and
development teams focused on customer
satisfaction Simplicity and sustainable
practice Gile emphasizes working
software as a key measure of progress we
will delve into the importance of
motivated individual face Toof face
communication and continuous Improvement
by understanding these principle guys
team can navigate changes effectively
and deliver value iteratively and also
Foster a culture of collaboration and
adaptability before we move on and
discuss more about it guys I request you

learn about scrum Concepts through
engaging session with the csts featuring

interactions for your scrum Master
certification hurry up guys join the
course now the course link is given in
the description box so guys let's start
our today's session so first let us
discuss about what are exactly agile
principles so guys basic basally agile
principles refer to the guiding values
and concept that underpin the agile
methodology which are a set of
approaches to software development and
project management the agile Manifesto
which was created in 2001 by a group of
software developers outline these
principles the manifesto emphasizes
flexibility collaboration customer
satisfaction over a rigid process and
documentation now let's move on and
discuss one by one what are those set of
12 agile principles that are applied in
our today's software industry so guys
here's our first agile principle that is
our highest priority is to satisfy
customer through early and continuous
delivery of valuable softwares in
contrast to the conventional product
development methods characterized by
prolonged Cycles agile principles
advocate for minimizing the duration
between conceptualization and product
launch the emphasis is swiftly placing a
functional product in the hands of
customers and also in the form of
minimum viable product successful
execution of this approach enables
product managers to promptly GA feedback
from the users which is then integrated
back into the product development
process to guide the subsequent phases
now how this is performed first of all
the product teams utilizes the minimum
viable product and engages in Rapid
experimentation to test hypothesis and
also to validate ideas it Embraces of
frequent releases to sustain an ongoing
feedback loop between customers and the
product and also it recognizes that
product shipment and completion are
distinct Concepts okay so instead of
presenting a finished product continuous
iterations are made to enhance the
product based on feedback from both
customers and the market now let's move
on to our second agile principle that is
we welcome the ch changes in the
requirement even late in the development
agile processes hardness change for the
customers competitive advantage in the
Practical terms what I mean to say that
agile principles and values emphasize
the earlier methods in the product
development that were resistant to
change and often sticking to detail and
inflexible plans whereas agile
principles endorsed the observation of
evolving markets customer requirements
and also competitive challenges advocate
creating a shift in directions when
necessary so in Practical terms if I say
product teams align themselves with
overarching strategic goals and also
possibly themes nested within these
goals the product Department remains
Vigilant actively monitoring the market
customer feedback and the other factors
that influences the product development
when actionable insights emerge plans
are adjusted to better meet the customer
and the businesses meet so this was all
about the second agile principles which
says that regular reviews adjustment and
sharing of product strategy is very very
crucial for our product to become
successful in the market now let's move
on and discuss about our third agile
principle that is deliver working
software frequently from a couple of
weeks to a couple of month with a
preference to the shorter time scale so
what does this means this means that the
agile methodology characterized by
short-term development Cycles focuses on
smaller portions of the product contrast
with the extensive documentation
typically associated with the waterfall
product development there's important
note to it that the frequent release
approach provides numerous opportunities
for the teams to validate product ideas
and strategies with qualified
stakeholders who experience each new
release in practice we perform something
like this in the Agile development
Cycles which are often referred to as
Sprints or iterations break downs the
product initiatives into manageable
chunks completed within a specific time
frame and this time frame usually ranges
from 2 to 4 weeks which reflects the
agile nature of the development process
in the St contrast to the mentioned
Marathon like Cycles it is followed by
the waterfall teams there is another
popular alternative to the agile Sprints
that is continuous deployment this
method involves shipping softwares
regularly guided less predetermined time
boxes and and more by making decisions
and implementing them promptly I hope so
guys you would have got an idea
regarding this agile principle now let's
move on and discuss about our fourth
agile principle which says that
businesses people and developers must
work together daily throughout the
project so what does this mean guys it
means that communication is a vital
element for the success of any project
or team and in the realm of agile
principle it is considered a daily
necessity there is a saying that it
takes a village to raise a child and
holds true for the product development
as well the achievement of a successful
product hinges on the insights from both
the businesses and the technical facets
of an organization and in this
collaboration can only be achieved
through consistent teamwork regular
communication between businesses
professionals and developers serves to
enhance alignment across the
organization fostering trust and
transparency so in Practical terms guys
cross functional agile product
development teams often incorporate
representatives from the product side
and this ensures that the product
perspective is integrated into the
development team Bridging the Gap
between Technical and the business
aspect of the product I hope so guys you
would have got an idea regarding this
principle now let's move on and discuss
about our fifth principle and it stat
something like this building a project
revolves around motivated individuals so
give them environment and support they
need and trust them to get the job done
a fundamental aspect of the agile
philosophy involves empowering
individuals and Team by instilling trust
and autonomy building an agile team
often requires careful consideration of
the right people and the right skill
sets with clearly defined
responsibilities before the start of the
project once the work is underway
micromanagement or excessive guidance
has no place in AI product management
plays a very crucial role in ensuring
that the engineering team
comprehensively understands the strategy
and the requirements before the
development phase the product team's
responsibility does not extend to
dictating the howb building of something
while they communicate the what and why
it is the delivery team's responsibility
to determine the most suitable approach
during Sprints product management
refrains from micromanaging outcomes
instead they make themselves available
to answer questions and also provide
support as needed so this principles
clearly states that Empower and trust
your team members now let's move on and
discuss about our next agile principle
that is the most efficient and effective
method of conveying information and
within a development team is a
face-to-face conversation in the context
of growing prevalence of distributed or
remote development teams the principle
of effective communication with between
product teams and developers remains
essential despite of some critiques the
core idea is to move conversations
Beyond written platforms like slack and
email emphasizing more on human
interaction so what happens basically in
our daily scenario we have the daily
standup meetings where a team members
share updates their progress plans and
any obstacles they may be facing second
one can be collaborative backlog
grooming sessions these are the joint
sessions where product teams and
developers review and refine the product
backlog ensuring a shared understanding
of the upcoming work then you have the
Sprint planning meetings meetings held
at the beginning of each Sprint to plan
and prioritize tasks for the upcoming
iteration and the fourth one can be
frequent demos showcasing work in
progress or completed features together
feedback and maintaining alignment
between product vision and development
so by incorporating these practices
agile methodology Fosters a culture of
continuous and open communication now
let's move on and discuss about our
seventh agile principle which states
something like this that working
software is the primary measure of the
progress adherence of the agile
philosophy which emphasizes that primary
focus should be on building software
with perfect and detailed documentation
taking a secondary role to working
software the mindset also prioritizes
creating products to Market quickly by
avoiding the bottleneck that extensive
documentation or it's not done until its
perfect mentality might create one so
the ultimate measure of success in this
approach is working product that
customers love so in practice what we do
we design and release the minimum viable
features we have the fail to fast
mentality which means that embracing
mentality that encourages moving forward
even in times of
uncertainity then we ship software often
we prioritize the release of useful
product in the present or waiting for a
perfect one in the future regular
software shipments allows for continuous
Improvement based on real world usage
and customer feedback so guys by
adopting these practices in agile
methodology it also encourages a
pragmatic and result driven approach now
let us move to our eighth principle
which says something like this that
agile processes promote sustainable
development the sponsors the developers
the users should be able to maintain a
constant Pace indefinitely so guys
basically it means that maintaining and
demanding and Rapid Release shedule can
be challenging for any team we all know
that especially when expectations are
set too high and in agile principles
which emphasizes The Importance of Being
mindful of these challenges also
advocates for setting realistics and
clear expectations the goal is to
preserve High morale improve work life
balance and also prevent the burnout and
turnover within the cross functional
teams now let us move to our ninth agile
principle which states something like
this that continuous attention to
technical excellence and good design
enhances the agility while the agile
philosophy advocates for shorter cycles
and frequent releases it also
underscores the importance of
maintaining clean and organized code
base so that in future we avoid issues
product managers May sometime overlook
this aspects as they may not be directly
involved in navigating to the product
code base but it remains very crucial
for the overall successful of the
project in practice we have the
awareness of the technical depth which
means that the teams must be conscious
of the technical depbt and consider any
implications it may have on the new
features or initiatives added to the
backlog then there will be a regular
refactoring allocation product managers
need to allocate the development
resources regularly for the refactoring
efforts by integrating these practices
agile methodology aims to strike a
balance between rapid development and
the code Baseline
cleanness now let us move to our 10th
agile principle which states something
like this it states that Simplicity the
art of maximizing the amount of work not
done is essential so guys it means that
the 820 rule the idea that 80% of the
results come from 20% of the efforts
align with agile principles it
emphasizes the importance of focusing on
impactful activities in product
management context if I talk about this
translates to a laser sha focus on
organizational objectives and making
strategic and purposeful prioritization
decisions agile principles discourages
aimless development and stress the
significance of being strategic and
purposeful in building products in
practice guys we have the focus product
designs where product managers need to
make highly focused decision aligning
product strategy closely with the
organizational goals next we have the
rapid testing and experimentations which
says that agile short Sprints offer
numerous opportunities for Rapid testing
and experimentation and this approach
helps reduce uncertainity about actual
impact of the
initiatives so guys you would have got
an idea regarding the 10th principle so
guys let us discuss about our 11th agile
principle and it states something like
this that in traditional software
development methodology IES team
structures can often be hierarchial
resembling a pyramid where management
makes key decision for the contributors
agile principles advocate for
self-organizing teams which adopt a more
flat management kind of style in this
approach the decisions are made
collabora by the team rather than
dictated by single manager or a
management team and this concept aligns
well with the agile's value of
prioritizing teams and interactions over
the processes and tools in practice what
we have have guys that we have the
self-organizing teams where the
autonomous groups within the
organization take control and
responsibility for their respective
projects we have varied implementation
across organization where different
organizations May implement the
principle of self-organizing teams in
various ways for example Spotify
employees product squads as a method of
practing this principle allowing teams
to organize and manage their work
independently so by embrace self
organizing teams agile methodologies aim
to foster a collaborative environment
where team members have a sense of
ownership responsibility and authority
to make decisions collabora collectively
and also promoting agility so guys let
us discuss about our final agile
principle that is the 12th principle and
it states something like this that at
regular intervals the team reflects on
how to become more effective then tunes
and adjust Its Behavior accordingly
it means something like this let me tell
you an anecdote we all know that living
by agile principle means that there is
no room for the mindset of we can change
because we have always done this way
this is completely not accepted in the
agile principles on the other hand agile
is rooted in continuous Improvement no
rigid adherence to predefined processes
just teams are always learning new
things about customers and markets and
they should also be learning from the
processes they use to gain those
insights in practice what we apply
experimentation beyond the product agile
teams are encouraged to experiment not
only with the product but also with
their processes we have the regular
retrospectives where agile teams conduct
regular retrospectives where they
discuss what went well what didn't and
how the process can be adjusted to
enhance future outcomes these
retrospective serves as opportun unities
for continuous Improvement and ensuring
that teams learn and adapt over the time
so guys by extending these principles of
experimentation and continuous
Improvement beyond the product to
include processes and teams agile
methodologies emphasizes adaptability
and commitment to finding more effective
ways of working regular retrospectives
provide a structure platform for teams
to reflect on their practices and also
fostering a culture of learning and
improvement with that said guys that was

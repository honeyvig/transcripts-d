hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will be
discussing about arduino projects the
different domains where arduino can be
used and how
let's look at today's agenda
we'll first look at logging projects
using arduino then we will look at some
of the rover projects using arduino
game projects using arduino then
automation projects using arduino
followed by which we will look at
robotics projects and help projects
then we will look at some of the drone
projects audio projects iot projects and
lastly we will look at sensor projects
using arduino
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell like so you never
miss an update from simpler
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
blocking projects using arduino
frequently we need to secure a space in
our home or business so that no one can
enter without our permission and our
valuable accessories and assets are
protected from theft or loss
there are many different types of
security systems available today
but they all rely on fingerprints retina
scanners iris scanners face id tongue
scanners rfid readers password pins
patterns and other biometrics for
authentication
the most cost effective solution is to
utilize an arduino based password or pin
based system
some of the locking projects using
arduino are arduino door lock system
rfid and keyboard lock system
we have unlocked door with knock system
push button lock system and gesture
control dock using arduino
then we have rover projects using
arduino
the arduino robot is the world's first
arduino powered vehicle
on each of robot's two boards there are
two cpus the motor board is in charge of
the motors while the control board is in
charge of reading sensors and deciding
how to run them
each board is a complete arduino board
that can be programmed using arduino ide
using arduino we can create many rover
projects like voice control rover
line follower rover
gesture control rover
survey rover
ir remote control rover
and similarly we have autonomous rover
and many more
game projects using arduino
some remarkable arduino based game
projects changing from retro gaming
played on a little screen to more
sophisticated projects requiring some
assembly some of the arduino gaming
projects are
snake game
then we have chess game
pinball
spaceship simulator
and claw machine
automation projects using arduino
the robust characteristics of arduino
are well suited to a popular section of
applications that is automation
the arduino board can be used to create
a wide variety of automation
applications
automation has brought convenience to
whole new level from controlling room
lights with your smartphone to
automatically organizing events
instead of using mechanical switches you
can now operate all of your home
electronics from the palm of your hand
some of the automation projects using
arduino are
home automation and sanitizer dispenser
automated shower boiler
automatic motion sensor trash
and ir remote controller home appliances
health projects using arduino
any medical equipment that has internet
connectivity
and can measure one or more health data
of a patient who is connected to the
device such as heartbeat body
temperature blood pressure ecg steps etc
is referred to as arduino based patient
health monitoring system
if there is a rapid change in patients
health the equipment can record and
transmit the data
iot encompasses everything from smart
watches to fitness tracker to hospital
equipment that can link to the internet
arduino-based health projects are being
developed to create new medical gadgets
it may be used to measure body factors
such as ecg temperature moisture and
heartbeat it also identifies the
patient's physical state and location
some of the health projects using
arduino are
smart bridge band smart bioware
portable ecg
ultrasonic site
and smart health kit
drone projects using arduino
drone are airborne vehicles that range
in size from micro to multi-rotor
quadcopters a camera is sometimes
included with a drone allowing the users
to watch and record the bird's eye
perspective a drone is made up of
numerous parts one of the most
significant of which is the flight
controller which acts as the drone's
brain
the arduino development board is great
for this purpose especially because
there are variety of models available
ranging from the tiny arduino nano to
arduino mega all of which are small
enough to fit into the design of a drone
some of the drone projects using arduino
are
quadcopter
autopilot drone
mind control drone
guide power drone
and hover craft
robotics project using arduino
we can learn about electronics mechanics
and software using the arduino robotics
project it includes a number of project
examples that you can easily copy as
well as robust robotics platform that
you may have to execute a variety of
jobs
some of the robotics projects are
robotic arm
drawing robot fire fighter robot ball
tracking robot and spider robot
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for

audio projects using arduino
if you enjoy working with both hardware
and software arduino is the perfect
hobby for you arduino is a programmable
logical controller that can do a variety
of cool things depending on your
programming skills
using the arduino to make music is a
special genre of projects
if you will some are straightforward to
implement while others are more
difficult
so some of the arduino projects for
audio are
paper piano with arduino
vfo or rf generator
arduino mp3 player
arduino uno guitar pedal and arduino
beat detector and we even have mini
vintage internet radio most good
communication using arduino and many
more
iot projects using arduino
arduino iot cloud is a tool that allows
creators to create connected products
quickly easily and securely multiple
devices can be linked together and data
can be exchanged in real time you can
also keep an eye on them using a simple
user interface from anywhere
some of the iot or bluetooth projects
using arduino are
iot bicycle radar iot pet feeder
telegram bot
arduino bluetooth camera and smart
parking system
sensor projects using arduino
one of the aspects that make an arduino
so valuable is the simplicity with which
it can retrieve sensor information
sensors are devices that transform a
physical quantity into an electrical
quantity such as light intensity or
temperature
the different types of sensors that are
available are
light sensor motion sensor temperature
sensor magnetic field sensor gravity
sensor humidity sensor moisture
vibration and pressure sensor electrical
field sensor sound sensor and position
sensor
manufacturing machinery aircraft
vehicles medicine and robotics are just
few of the use cases of these sensors
so the different sensor projects that
can be made using arduino are
temperature monitoring
smoke detection using gas sensor
3d scanner
smart plant incubator
and water quality monitoring system
so with that we have reached the end of
this video thank you so much for being
here keep learning and stay tuned to
simply love
